<subject>National Signing Day</subject>
<post author="JonPerera" timestamp="Feb 5, 2014 9:32 AM">
<s>across the united states today, thousands of high school athletes will "sign up" with colleges and universities, committing to teams in college football and beyond.</s><s> it's amazing, and there's a great deal of excitement here.</s><s> we congratulate these amazing athletes!</s><s>!</s><s> 
</s><s>what i notice though, is a total mis-match in terms of *how* these transactions are geting done.</s><s> basically, universities are asking these digital-native athletes to "fax" in their commitment, as opposed to sending a document electronically for an esignature.</s><s> finding a fax machine today is hard.</s><s> i suspect that this will be the first-and-last time that any of these students use a fax machine in their lifetime.</s><s> and 100% of these students likely have a smart phone, and would prefer to sign electronically. 
</s><s>so it's time for athletic departments across the u.s. to move towards a more modern, 21st century approach for national signing day, and consider technologies like adobe echosign.</s><s> your thoughts?

<subject>FHA Announces eSignature Support for Mortgages</subject>
<post author="JonPerera" timestamp="Feb 4, 2014 3:51 PM">
<s>over here at adobe echosign, we're really thrilled with the decision by the federal housing administration (fha) that it is granting "expanded" authority to lenders to accept esignatures like echosign on documents associated with mortgage loans.</s><s> the new approach allows e-signatures on loan origination, servicing, and loss mitigation documents, as well as fha insurance claims, real estate-owned (reo) sales contracts and related addenda.</s><s> as you might know, the current fha policy allows for electronic signatures only on third-party documents such as sales contracts and other documents not controlled by the lender.</s><s> lenders choosing to employ e-signatures may begin using this policy immediately for single family forward mortgages and fha's reverse mortgage products, home equity conversion mortgages (hecm).</s><s> lenders are required to adhere to the electronic signatures in global and national commerce act (esign), have specific technology and operational capabilities and controls, documented quality control processes, and the ability to adapt e-signature to fha's existing record retention processes.</s><s> the e-signatures policy will help streamline the origination process and help reduce document submission timeframes for borrowers seeking options to avoid foreclosure.</s><s> initially, e-signatures will not be accepted on the mortgage note itself.</s><s> the fha plans to begin accepting e-signatures on forward mortgage notes at the end of the year.</s><s> for more information, please check the fha site here.

<subject>Adobe EchoSign - 20 Free Licences for 15,000 Schools</subject>
<post author="JonPerera" timestamp="Feb 28, 2014 4:59 AM">
<s>for our k12 schools across the u.s. this is a very cool day.</s><s> as part of a broader announcement with the white house's connected initiative, we announced that we're providing 20 free licenses of adobe echosign enterprise edition to 15,000 schools.</s><s> to put this in context: Ê adobe is answering president obama's challenge to bring technology education and teacher training to american schools by committing over $300 million in software and professional development to the white house's connected initiative. Ê this commitment is among the largest by a single company to date, bringing the collective total of private sector donations to over $1 billion. Ê for the past 20 years, adobe has helped k-12 schools integrate creativity and digital literacy into its curriculums through its philanthropic program adobe youth voices and the adobe education exchange. Ê we know that that schools will benefit from esignatures to streamline paper-centric processes, and go "all digital." Ê over the coming weeks, we will post information on how schools can get provisioned and training here -- this isn't about "launch and leave." this is a commitment to help our schools go digital, so we're here for the long-haul.

<s>echosign is not integrated with form central. if you'd like to use your form with echosign, you'll need to export to a regular pdf, which then can be used in an echosign transaction.</s><s> so you basically use form central to create and edit the form, but not to host it.

<s>hello all i am new here so go easy!</s><s> we are currently playing around with a few company's who offer online document signing i really like how easy echosign is to manage and the way it creates the widgets but i have a few issues which i would love some help with.</s><s> so i am creating the form in acrobat pro xi then opening it in echosign to convert to a widget all is good on this part but when i embed the java into my website the form displays smaller than it should be this then means the user has to use the zoom function which cuts off the viewable page this wouldn't be so bad but when you move the form to see which box to enter information the form jumps up. it's really not very user friendly for users filling in the form, the ability to resize the widget would solve this problem.</s><s> any help is greatly appreciated.</s><s> many thanks richard

<s>hi, 
</s><s>you can achieve this by using text tags.</s><s> echosign text tags are specially formatted text that can be placed anywhere within the content of your document specifying the location, size, type of fields such as signature and initial fields, check boxes, radio buttons and form fields, and advanced optional field processing rules.</s><s> text tags can also be used as names of pdf form fields. 
</s><s>text tags are converted into echosign form fields when the document is sent for signature or uploaded to the echosign document library.</s><s> echosign text tags can be placed in any document type such as pdf, microsoft word, powerpoint, excel and text files (.</s><s>txt, .rtf)
