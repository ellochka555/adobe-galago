<s>"1" will do the trick, but the resulting tick will not be very visible during the signing stage. 
</s><s>possibly becasue the form itself is a livecycle (static) xfa form. 
</s><s>you could try refrying the form by printing the pdf to a pdf printer then readding the form fields and using text tgas in these fields: https://www.echosign.adobe.com/en/support/knowledgebase/add_form_field s_and_signature_blocks_to_my_documents_through_echosign_text_tags.html

<s>hi naveen, 
</s><s>for read only checkboxes your default value in the soap request needs to match the export value of the checkbox in acrobat.</s><s> (check this via the checkbox properties in acrobat) 
</s><s>by default this is set to yes. 
</s><s>so either chnage the checkbox properties in acrobat to match your request, or match your request to the property in acrobat.
