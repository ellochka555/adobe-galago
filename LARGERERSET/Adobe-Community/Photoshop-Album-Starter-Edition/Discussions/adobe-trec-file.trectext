<s>i wouldn't recommend transferring starter edition over to your new computer.</s><s> it's age, and the fact that it is no longer supported, makes it too risky to trust your valuable photos at this time. 
</s><s>if you are interested in using similar software on your new computer, you could look into google picasa, or simply use the built-in solution (both mac and windows include apps that help you handle your photo collections). 
</s><s>the important part is that you do need to locate the files that starter edition had been tracking; they are usually in your my pictures/starter edition folder, but the program doesn't require them to be there, and you should do a thorough check across your drive for all photos.</s><s> if they are jpeg files, you might be able to do a search for '*.jpg' files to get a list that can be easily copied to a single folder, then copied to a thumb drive or somesuch for moving to your new system.

<s>hi, 
</s><s>you can't register it because it has been discontinued.</s><s> announcement: photoshop album starter edition discontinued 
</s><s>the photoshop album starter edition software has been discontinued. 
</s><s>if you are using starter edition version 3.0 or later, you can continue to access your starter edition catalog and files if you install the photoshop elements trial.</s><s> using photoshop elements, you can continue to catalog, tag and share your photos and videos. 
</s><s>you may otherwise safely uninstall starter edition without losing access to any files.</s><s> that is because starter edition does not copy files or store them in any way that the operating system (ie, windows) cannot find them.</s><s> the most likely location of your files is in your my pictures folder. 
</s><s>consider using photoshop elements as your next step in managing, editing and sharing your digital photos and video.</s><s> if you are looking for an online backup service to protect you in case of loss of computer or hard drive, photoshop elements is integrated with photoshop.com to preserve and restore your entire library of backed up photos; backing up is easy, using photoshop elements 9 or later. by mark dahm (feb 14, 2011) regards, steve

<s>adobe poor, 
</s><s>you're not alone in wondering about how to get photos 'out' of starter edition.</s><s> there are a few posts like this in the forum, all of which are based on the false assumption that starter edition has exclusive access to the photos that appear to be 'in' the program. 
http://forums.adobe.com/message/2413333#2413333 http://forums.adobe.com/message/2281147#2281147 http://forums.adobe.com/message/2165616#2165616 
it is a common misconception that starter edition 'stores', or copies, your files into it.</s><s> but the program does not move or copy files at all, rather it scans your system's my pictures directory, and generates miniature versions of your pictures (called thumbnails) so that you can browse a 'flat' list of thumbnails of your photos, overcoming the inconvenience of having to go into separate folders in windows explorer to have to find files.the thumbnails, as well as any tags, and albums that you create in starter edition are all stored in the photoshop album catalog file, separate from your pictures, and your pictures remain where you originally copied them to your computer. 
</s><s>if you use photoshop album to subsequently download files from a digital camera or scanner, the default location where the program will create those files would be in the my pictures>digital camera photos folder.</s><s> but if you do not use photoshop album starter edition to download files from your camera, then you will find that folder empty. 
</s><s>the thumbnails in the starter edition catalog will exist, even if you decide to move or delete the original photos that were added to the program.</s><s> this will cause files in the photoshop album catalog to become 'disconnected' from the original photos.</s><s> to reconnect the files, you can use the file>reconnect missing files command to see if the program can locate the original files in a new location, and once again re-link the catalog thumbnails to the files they once referenced. 
</s><s>since photoshop album has been discontinued, i recommend that folks find an alternative solution.</s><s> one alternative that will preserve most of what you've created in starter edition is the photoshop elements 8 trial.</s><s> install that, and it will automatically convert the photoshop album catalog to a current format, and the program will not time out, as starter edition did.</s><s> if you want to purchase more editing power, you can also choose to purchase the full program, but it's not required. 
</s><s>if you are like many who have come to this forum wondering how you can get to your photos, now that the program has become locked or expired, don't worry; your photos have never been moved by photoshop album; they remain wherever you intially put them, on your hard drive.</s><s> to get to them, you can navigate your file system using windows explorer.</s><s> they are typically in your my documents>my pictures folder.</s><s> here is a handy how-to that you could refer to to find photos on your system, as well as some other tips for how you can use folders to keep your photos organized: http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/maintain/filemgmt.mspx 
hope those tips help!

<s>adobe photoshop album starter 3.2 is asking for unlocking code? 
</s><s>today is 7/15/13.</s><s> i only just started using this program for my camera, didn't know it expired, after the registration page told me.</s><s> there was no warning on that.</s><s> i have photos in there that are very important and need to get them put back onto my camera asap. 
i went on to get photos after they were in album and the register page came up, and it took it as i wanted to delete from camera.</s><s> no!</s><s> due to the register screen popping up over top the photo album. 
i did call adobe support and they said it is no longer a supported program.they helped me set up a revel account, then they said to search the photos.</s><s> yes, that worked it i can get the jpg names. 
</s><s>what i need is to get the few pictures from 3.2 back onto my camera.</s><s> or, could i get them back on my camera through revel.</s><s> i need easy steps.</s><s> i am not familiar with this stuff.</s><s> please help!</s><s> this is urgent!</s><s> thanks you for the help, noltfam5

<s>what you "see" in photoshop starter edition is just a low resolution copy of your origional image.</s><s> starter edition simply catalogs the images on your hard disk, it doesn't keep them in itself.</s><s> if you click on an image in starter edition and select view>properties, a window will pop up.</s><s> look at the bottom of the properties window and you can get the file path to where your image was when starter edition cataloged it. then, use windows to navigate to that same place on your hard disk.</s><s> if the images is not there, that's the reason starter edition is complaining about it being disconnected.</s><s> the image isn't where it thinks it is.</s><s> somehow it got moved or deleted.</s><s> if it was simply moved, you can weither move it back, or use starter edition to "reconnect" the iamge.</s><s> reconnecting simply means telling starter edition where the file has been moved to.</s><s> i hope this helps expalin what's going on.</s><s> i also hope your orgional images were moved, and not deleted from your hard disk.

<s>if you get a scratch disk error, go to help in photodeluxe, click on index, and type "scratch disk".</s><s> you will see the following instructions:   photodeluxe home edition uses both installed memory (ram) and scratch disk virtual memory to perform most operations, but some operations (such as using the distort filters) run exclusively in ram.</s><s> when home edition has insufficient ram to perform these operations, the application displays an error message and does not complete the operation.</s><s> before allocating more memory to home edition, make sure you have at least 32 mb of ram on your computer.   to allocate more memory to home edition:   1  at the top of your screen, choose file > preferences > memory preferences.</s><s> 2  increase the used by photodeluxe value to no more than 75% (windows 95 or windows 98) or 65% (windows nt), and then click ok.

<s>hi joseph, we don't email so that other people can benefit when they search the forum for solutions to their problems.</s><s> nevertheless... what has happened is that the photos have become disconnected from the thumbnails in psa-se.</s><s> the application does not hold them.</s><s> it merely monitors their location.</s><s> first verify that you did not delete the folder in windows explorer.</s><s> if you didn't, then you can click on file, reconnect.</s><s> the problem with this approach is... you only reconnect to suggested images and one at time...</s><s> cheers

<s>if anyone is still having trouble getting a pass code for adobe photoshop starter edition 3.0 you will need to contact their csr directly at 1-800-833-6687.</s><s> i just called i spoke with a rep. by the name of jess she is a female she was very helpful and polite.</s><s> what they will need is your contact info. and your email address so they can manually find your starter account in their system.</s><s> then they will issue you a code to unlock the system to retrieve your locked pictures. 
</s><s>you don't need to register becasue adobe 3.0 is no longer being used or avaliable.</s><s> the new system is photoshop.com you will need to register for photoshop.com.</s><s> it's simple and free of charge at no cost to you.</s><s> what you will need to do once you receive the code is immediately transfer your photos from adobe 3.0 to photoshop.com. it will take some time to download but let it run.</s><s> remember this is only a temporary code so it will expire and lock again if it's not used in a timely manner. 
</s><s>the code i received from jess was 92c1d14e.</s><s> this unlocked my account immediately with no problems.</s><s> so i hope this code will work for you.</s><s> i don't know if this code will work for others however it doesn't hurt to give it a try.</s><s> if not then please call the number above that i've provided you with so one of the reps. can issue you a code.
