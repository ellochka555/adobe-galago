<s>short answer: in 99% of cases, you don't lose anything.</s><s> but you will not be able to edit the files in the original software. 
</s><s>longer answer: if you convert a raw to dng with the last dng converter/acr/lightroom, all the data will be still there, even the private manufacturers' data.</s><s> but the original software (dpp for canon, viewnx for nikon, etc) will not be able to read them, since they do not implement the full dng specs.</s><s> se my post at http://forums.adobe.com/thread/1414404#6155513 . 
there are indeed some cases where you lose data: for example, sigma dp merril / foveon data is linearized during the raw-dng conversion (look at http://www.barrypearson.co.uk/articles/dng/specification.htm for an explication).</s><s> and some cameras have blind photosites and other internal settings that are not saved to dng since they are useless.</s><s> you also lose crcs of the original files, like nikon and canon image authentication (well, it is not a severe issue, as these authentication systems have been cracked in 2011: http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/28/both-nikon-and-canons-image-authentic ation-systems-busted/) 
</s><s>as jimhess said, you don't lose any metadata applied by lightroom, since they are saved in the catalog and in the related xmp file. 
</s><s>what you gain with dng? 
- dng is an open format, so you are sure that, in the case the manufacturer closes or decides not to support anymore your model, at least you have the full specifications to get back your data. - xmp files are saved inside dng, and not as a sidecar file, so you don't risk to lose your modifications when using the os filesystem actions to move files (lr automatically moved raw & xmp files) - a dng is usually lighter

<s>this is what your camera does when adl is enabled: 
* assesses highlight clipping, and based on assessment, drops exposure to some extent. 
</s><s>so, net result raw-data-wise: possibly reduced exposure (nothing else, except adl setting jotted down in the metadata). 
</s><s>it (your camera) then proceeds to boost exposure in conjunction with intelligent contrast reduction and bakes that into the jpeg preview - making for nice jpegs, and one of the reasons people sometimes prefer in-camera jpegs to acr's default processing, which doesn't do stuff like that automatically, by default... 
(note: viewnx and nx2 can replicate what your camera does, after the fact, when shooting raw). 
</s><s>so, you can still take full advantage of adl in a raw-only acr-centric workflow simply by applying a preset, e.g. 
+exposure -highlights +shadows 
in other words, you get the benefit of in-camera intelligence which judicially reduces exposure to preserve highlights, but you have to do the compensatory processing in acr somehow. 
</s><s>most people just turn adl off, and keep an eye on their exposure, but i hear ya: adl still has value even if raw-converter/processor ignores it. 
i have implemented camera emulation in ottomanic importer (for nd300-like cameras only: respects in-camera profile, adl, ...</s><s> ), but i don't use it m'self - not sure how many people do use it. 
</s><s>another option (post-import) is to use exifmeta to smart-collect on various adl settings, then use collectionpreseter to auto-apply the compensatory settings. 
</s><s>personally, i don't think it's worth the trouble, but you might. 
</s><s>that's probably the best you'll be able to do for now. 
</s><s>to be clear: it makes very little sense (in my opinion) in a acr-centric workflow to save tiffs in nikon software, in order to take advantage of adl - acr's highlight & shadow controls are better than what nikon does for intelligent contrast reduction, and it's easy enough to boost exposure when under-exposed - ya gotta do that anyway, when called for, regardless of adl...

<s>hi, i am not knowing the direct answer to your question (command line option to skip existing destinations). 
</s><s>however, i found a few command line options not being documented: 
-x extract original or so (just guessing from the error message) -lossy enable lossy compression (full resolution) -count <number> enable lossy compression with that <number> many pixels (e.g., 16200000 for 16.2mp), ui only offers 15mp here! -side <number> enable lossy compression with that <number> many pixels along the long side (e.g., 1920 for hd) 
i see a symbol "skipalreadyconverted" for the ui but didn't find an option to trigger it.

<s>i have been trying to use the dng profile editor to create an inverted tone curve to import a color negative.</s><s> i want to create an inverted linear tone curve when i convert the negative and use the downstream software to apply the appropriate camera curve.</s><s> the issue i face can be replicated by doing these steps:

<s>camera raw and the dng converter are not the same thing.</s><s> adobe camera raw is a plug-in that is part of photoshop and photoshop elements.</s><s> its purpose is to open and allow you to make modifications to the raw image data contained in your raw files taken by your camera.</s><s> the dng converter is not part of photoshop elements, not part of adobe camera raw, it does not allow you to do anything other than create digital negative (dng) copies of your raw files.</s><s> some people like to use the dng converter routinely and automatically convert all their raw files to dng.</s><s> a dng file contains all of the raw image data that was in the original raw file created by the camera.</s><s> but the dng file is a standardized format that adobe has created.</s><s> their argument is that it simplifies raw processing and assures that your files will be usable in the future.</s><s> the only problem with that argument, from my perspective, is that it limits the software that can be used primarily to adobe products.</s><s> many other products do not support the dng format.</s><s> i don't convert to dng because adobe camera raw supports my cameras.</s><s> the only time i would ever consider converting to dng is if i had an older version of lightroom or camera raw that didn't support the raw format from a new camera. 

</s><s>now, the question to you is, are you really using the separate, freestanding, independent dng converter, or are you talking about dng conversion from within photoshop elements?</s><s> there is a difference, a big difference.</s><s> have you specifically downloaded and installed the dng converter, or are you simply trying to work within photoshop elements?</s><s> this must be clarified if we are going to make any progress.

<s>there seems to be more than one issue here, and i'm not sure how to help you solve them.</s><s> i don't use photoshop elements.</s><s> first of all let's clarify the dng converter.</s><s> it is an independent program, not a plug-in or an add-on to photoshop or photoshop elements.</s><s> the sole purpose of the dng converter is to create dng copies of your raw images.</s><s> the dng converter does not depend on photoshop or photoshop elements or any other program to function.</s><s> if the dng converter has been lost and is not on your list of installed programs then you need to download it and install it again. 
</s><s>as far as the "save as" problem is concerned, i think photoshop elements requires that the image not have any layers, and that the one layer be identified as the background layer in the layer stack. 
</s><s>if you are seeing the jpeg, but seeing the "ps" icon for the other image in photoshop elements, that would indicate that camera raw is not installed correctly.

a few questions: 1.</s><s> what version of photoshop elements are you using?</s><s> 2. in elements, if you go to help/about plug-ins, what version of camera raw does it indicate you are using?</s><s> 3. what version of the dng converter did you try to install?</s><s> did it ever work?</s><s> 4. why are you converting to dng?</s><s> have you ever done it successfully?

<s><quote>

</s></quote>because the preview (jpeg, embedded) in the dng is a re-rendering based on adobe defaults.</s><s> it's not the same embedded preview that came in your nef (which was created, initially anyway, in the camera). 
</s><s>to better understand, it helps to know how the story unfolds from the beginning: 
when you press the shutter release, the camera takes the raw image data from the sensor, folds in the camera settings, crunches it through the nikon image processing "engine", and compresses the result into a jpeg, which it subsequently stores (along with the raw data) in the raw nef file, and shows you on the back of the camera, etc. 
</s><s>when you convert to dng, lightroom does something similar: it takes the raw image data from the raw file, ignores most of the camera settings (except, for example, white balance), crunches it through the adobe image processing "engine", and compresses the result into a jpeg, which it subsequently stores in the raw dng file, and shows you via os codecs or in acr, or lr... 
</s><s>so, bottom line, you are just seeing the difference between current renderings of nikon vs. adobe.</s><s> if you edit the nef in nx2, the preview will be updated when you save the nef.</s><s> if you edit the dng in acr or lr, you can also update the preview to reflect the current edits. 
etc...

<s>what features are people looking for in a codec?</s><s> i'm taking the initiative and writing a commercial decoder.</s><s> i don't know what adobe's timeline is, so i have no idea if i will get scooped.</s><s> on the other hand, apple wrote their own support into their os, and it seems like microsoft should be expected to do the same from adobe's point of view: adobe provided a nice sdk, which i am using, and is it adobe's duty to port their technology to every platform?</s><s> getting in thumbnails and previews shouldn't be too hard.</s><s> metadata reading isn't all that difficult, but i wouldn't trust wics metadata writer to get things right.</s><s> however, from the sound of it people will most likely using an adobe product to do editing of either image data or metadata.</s><s> also, are folks aware of any web sites that are maintaining sample dng images?</s><s> there are a few flavors: those made with acr, cameras that shoot dng natively, and then there's hasselblad's flexcolor, and i don't know if they are using the dng sdk or rolling their own implementation.</s><s> it would be nice if there was a reference library of images available to folks that need to do interop testing.</s><s> also, if anyone from adobe wants to chat about their implementation of the codec, then i'd like to also do interop testing with their codec (i.e., what happens when both are installed on a pc), if it is something they are indeed interested in developing and maintaining.</s><s> so i guess a have a few questions.</s><s> 1. is thumbnail support and preview enough for your needs?</s><s> 2. as a bonus, i suspect having the ability to read out metadata would still be useful for those who have a lot of images.</s><s> would it be a show stopper to be unable to see all of your metadata in the vista explorer and other vista imaging apps?</s><s> the less i have to do, the sooner you'll have your thumbnails and preview.</s><s> 3. what about editing metadata?</s><s> would you trust a wic codec, or would you use the main editing tools in your work flow for maintaining metadata?

<s>1. not really for thumbnails especially since arcsoft has a viewer that works ok. but having windows preview it full size would be great.</s><s> 2. that would be a big help. especially if windows can search the metadata.</s><s> 3.</s><s> i would trust it after some test time.</s><s> i would like to be able to edit it anywhere anytime, not in a specific program.</s><s> thanks!</s><s>!</s><s>
