i am glad that adobe finally made a determined effort to bring "collect for output" to illustrator 14 years after freehand had it and 5 years after adobe bought macromedia and rebranded the freehand collect for output ideal as "package files".</s><s> i guess the time was right to start searching for features that could be used as carrots for the creative cloud subscription version to push the whole "get the latest features" benefit ideal via the cloud.</s><s> but certainly something that was available 14 years ago cant be considered innovative or new, nor a determined effort.</s><s> also i believe code line's artfiles v1 has been around since maybe 2004 or so, so again if a third party can accomplish it then adobe the actual makers of illustrator didn't really have an excuse nor are they being very innovative.</s><s> also, "linkes information" is just an updated version of freehands "link info dialog" as another dated example. 
</s><s>however if we finally get to see features from freehand or elsewhere that have been lacking in illustrator for years then hey something good may come out of this after all, there are certainly plenty of features to bring from freehand and elsewhere thats for sure.

<s>i'm sure there were many features in illustrator that freehand never had.</s><s> also anyone who knows the intricacies of how different applications work can bet that it is not simply a matter of rebranding or copying code from one to the other.</s><s> the technologies could be as different as chalk and cheese, even applications from the same company could also be very different.</s><s> for instance, adobe indesign has package for output for a long time now - does it mean that illustrator can simply take that piece of code and paste it in their application & expect it to just work?</s><s> i guess it's not that easy - nothing comes for free, i'm sure.

<s>just a heads up when creating updates on the mac. 
</s><s>while your update bumped the version shown in the get info window (cfbundlegetinfostring) in the /contents/info.plist, you didn't bother to do anything about the localized versions of cfbundlegetinfostring in the *.lproj/infoplist.strings files which are still: 
cfbundlegetinfostring = "16.0.0, copyright © 1987-2012 adobe systems inc. all rights reserved.";

you may, smart guides being your friends: 
1) with the direct selection tool click or drag over the anchor point or the segment in question to reveal the handle to be changed; 2) with the line segment tool clickdrag from the handle (where smart guides say handle) to the anchor point (where smart guides say anchor), underway the anchor point disappears so you will have to hit it, possibly by following the path (where smart guides say path); 3) if you wish to extend the handle, in the transform palette click the appropriate reference point and multiply the w or h value by a sufficient number and ctrl/cmdclick to extend the line past the handle; 4) with thedirect selection tool clickdrag the handle along the line (where smart guides say path) until you reach the desired spot; 5) delete the line.

<s>jacob, you gave me the final input. 
</s><s>creating a guide from a simple path is the easiest, fastest and most intuitive way to solve the problem.</s><s> the other way is to suggest adobe to implement that function on the "ctrl-shift"-keys. 

</s><s>so my way is this: 
1) select the anchor point to see the direction line and direction points 2) zoom in to having the three points nearly filling the screen 3) switch to path view 4) with the line segment tool clicking precise on one direction point while focusing the position of the anchor point 5) now dragging the tool to and over the (dissappeared) anchor point creating a tangent to the path 6) select both, the anchor point and the new path to check accuracy 7) select the path and enlarge it with the scale tool 8) right click on the enlarged path and chose make guide and then lock guides 9) adjust direction points while always snapping to the guide

<s>the main problem is with blufftitler is it doesn't have a very good eps handler as it can really only import eps files that are about 10k each and are not overly complex.</s><s> if you look at all the sample .eps files that come with it, each one is about 1 or 2k each.</s><s> a simple circle in illustrator, even when saved as v3 without a preview, is around 258k. the reason for the larger file sizes is due to the extra things being saved in the file that aren't even on the page, such as brush presets and graphic styles.</s><s> the sample .eps files that come with blufftitler don't have these presets so the files are already smaller. 
</s><s>something you may want to try is to open up one of the sample eps files and use that file for your vector work but save the file with a new name.</s><s> i found that by doing this i could get the files down to a much smaller size.</s><s> you may also want to setup any vectors in illustrator first, save them, and then open the files in inkscape, http://www.inkscape.org.</s><s> from what i've read, inkscape can get you fairly small file sizes so it's something you should check out.

<s>welcome to the forum. 
</s><s>creating identity imagery is a noble pursuit.</s><s> i would say to begin by studying what a logo is, what it should not be, and learning why.</s><s> you can start by looking at all the logos out there, and analyzing why each one works well (assuming it does) for who it represents.</s><s> the logo is the most basic of communication vehicles, and is a key visual element to any brand.</s><s> its success or failure has everything to do with who it represents, what their key communiction factors are, and who their audience is.</s><s> the study of identity design is a worth study, and not a shallow one.</s><s> but i should point out that it has little to do with tools, such as illustrator.</s><s> illustrator will probably be the final implementation tool for logo design, but it has little or nothing to do with the actual design part of the process.</s><s> when you get that far, you might consider beginning your design for a logo with pencil and paper.</s><s> concept, not technique, is what makes a logo successful or not. 
</s><s>what makes a logo "beautiful" is not so much how "cool" it looks, but what it says, and how well it speaks that message to its intended audience.

<s>pabzz, 
two possible (maybe the most probable) causes could be: 
corrupt font(s): you may move all (non system) fonts out of the fonts folder and move them back in; font moving may be done in groups; this is reversible. 
a font caches issue: clear the font cache; instructions may be read here; there are font caches clearing applications, searchable with the search term clear font caches.

<s>wade, thank you so much for your listing down a comprehensive list of possible solutions. 
</s><s>i'm willing to give all possibilities the benefit of the doubt including font corruption. 
i have done the new user account prior to reinstalling the os a couple times: a guest user and an 2nd admin user, both still got the crashes.</s><s> i tried it again earlier as per your advice after the latest os & software install today but still getting the crash. 
</s><s>interesting note: after the latest clean install, my font folder in the library is empty whereas the last 2 times i installed the os and just migrated the applications, it brought over some fonts.</s><s> tried both migrating just applications and prior to that, migrated applications and settings (this was where i thought had caused the problems). 
</s><s>also, in the first instance of migrating the applications (that included all the settings) which carried over all the fonts.</s><s> i ran font book and did a validate fonts, it red flagged a lot of fonts as unsafe so i deleted them, yet still crashes illustrator after. 
i also tried downloading an app to remove the font cache after deleting the red flagged fonts but no dice. 
</s><s>this time around, font validation cleared every font on the list as safe to use.</s><s> for some reason, the fonts are no longer in the fonts folder in the library but font book is reading fonts from somewhere else in the system. 
</s><s>as far as corrupt preference, i just moved the entire adobe illustrator cs5.1 settings to the desktop.</s><s> you've mentioned perhaps its also other preferences so i emptied the entire preference folder temporality & moved it to the desktop but no luck there. 
i have not added any plug ins or 3rd party software yet, just the cs5.5 production suite right after the os install. 
</s><s>and finally i changed the permission settings on the illustrator setting folder and all of the files and folders in its contents and still had the crashes. 
</s><s>again, thanks for your help & advice and the effort to try and fix this.</s><s> i'm willing to try anything, even trying these solutions several times including wiping my hard drive and re-installing the os a few times already, which takes 8-10 hours every time i do it since its all re-installed through wifi for the macbook retina's. 
i think i've exhausted all possible solutions unless anyone still has suggestions for me to try.</s><s> i would really appreciate your help.

<s>hello everyone, 
i'm running into the same issue every time i try to launch illustrator cc.</s><s> the program launches (i see the splash screen), illustrator opens, after 2-3 seconds, it crashes and windows displays the message "adobe illustrator cc has stopped working...".</s><s> windows checks for solutions, but finds none.</s><s> it happens when i run the 32-bit and 64-bit versions.</s><s> i've had this problem for maybe 5 months (since i got illustrator cc).</s><s> i don't have this issue with any other adobe software - photoshop, indesign, after effects, illustrator cs6 etc. i've talked to numerous customer service reps, and have yet to have a real solution. 
a couple of possibly relevant pieces of information: i do have a wacom bamboo create and illustrator cc works in a secondary user account, but not my primary.</s><s> representatives have told me that since it works in another user account, then there must be a problem with my primary account.</s><s> however, i don't know what said problem is, nor do i know how to fix it.</s><s> switching user accounts whenever i need to use illustrator cc (which is often, being a graphic designer) is a hassle and really disrupts my workflow.</s><s> it can't be the final solution.</s><s> so, i've done just about everything suggested in other discussions about this problem.</s><s> i have 
uninstalled then reinstalled illustrator cc signed in and out of the cc run the program as an administrator disabled my graphics card and launched ai cc updated my graphics driver removed any third-party plug-ins (there weren't any in the first place) updated my wacom driver 
i have an hp pavilion dv6 notebook pc, running windows 7 home premium (64-bit service pack 1), amd radeon hd 6520g graphics, 6gb ram

<s>first you need to design your patterns. you create a pattern swatch by dragging artwork to the swatch pallete. if you make a square with no attribute and place this behing the artwork you drag into the pallet, it becomes the crop area for your pattern tile. 
then you draw your shapes however you choose (with the pen tool, making primatives, using pathfinder or free hand drawing) and select the pattern as your fill. you'll need to make different patterns with different densities for the shading you want to achieve. 
for the stroke. depending which version of illustrator you have you can use profiles to give the stroke with variety.

<s>yeah i figured. that's why i would use the offset path effect instead. 
instead of using layers (assuming you are using actual layers and not appearance fills and strokes). select your type and add a new fill in the appearance pallete. make this black. 
then add a new fill and make it white. with that fill selected go to menu/effect/path/offset path and select the pt size you want to offest by. 
then add another fill, make it black and add an offset to that fill too. 
arrange your fills in the right orther ofcourse. 
then apply a warp to the whole thing.

<s>if you use the clipping mask tool, it will "crop" your image, but if you try to export it as a raster file, your dimensions will remain the same as the original photo's dimensions, meaning you will have white space in your jpeg/png/bmp/gif/tif file where your clipping mask is...i've had this problem before, the way i deal with it is...get ready...i use ms paint to easily crop out the white space by pulling the image limiters(little blue dots)to only where my image should show, rotating the image if necessary, and repeating the process until i have my image cropped...no need to go back into photoshop, or even use photoshop.</s><s> one of the rare times when ms paint comes in handy...to be honest, i've never used it for anything else.

<s>well, i would imagine that's because it's not hard to put borders around clip masked objects...for the 1 or 2 of you out there who don't actually know, there's several ways of accomplishing borders in illustrator.</s><s> 1) brush tool, nuff said.</s><s> 2) create a box around your object using the rectangle tool, then apply whatever brush you create for your border, or just leave it as a box, for the minimalistic look.

<s>thanks for help.</s><s> since i first read this thread i have been sure that the question was how to make a photoshop-like bevel on text, meaning that type object would still remain type object after applying the bevel.</s><s> at least that is the question i have been looking for the answer to. 
</s><s>when i apply effect>path>offset path on text, that shows only the offset path without the original text, but it is still a single type object.</s><s> and that's not enough to make blend.</s><s> to make blend i need at least two objects. 
i found two ways to do that: 
1.</s><s> i expand the appearance of the text and it would become a group of compound paths, that represent both original text and the offset one and that can be then blended between, but they are no longer editable as text after expanding the appearance. 
2. the second way is to duplicate the text object before offsetting it's path and put the copy above the original.</s><s> then apply effect>path>offset path on the topmost text, change its color and then blend both types.</s><s> this way partially solves the problem, because as a result i have a blend of two types, which are separately editable.

<subject>How can I get the Bevel & Emboss effect for text in Illustrator?</subject>
<post author="jaseinatl%40gmail.com" timestamp="Apr 13, 2012 7:37 PM">
<s>i'm not sure if you can get the exact same affect that you are looking for, but when i want to do bevel/embossing/cutout text styling while maintaining text editablitility, i apply transformations to the textblock object and store those transformations as a style. 
</s><s>so, for embossing, etc, i select the textblock with the object point (black arrow) and under the appearance tab, i duplicate the main text's fill property, then change the color to white, the blend method to screen and opacity to 40%.</s><s> i apply the offsetpath transform to it and offest the path by 2px. finally i use the "tranform" transformation filter to translate the new fill -2px vertically -1px horixontally (this gives the outerbevel-highlight appearance when positioned behind the original fill in your appearance panel.</s><s> finally, i do the same thing in reverse with the initial fill: color:black,opacity:darken 40%, fx: offsetpath +2px, transform:y:2px, x:1px.</s><s> this gives the lower shadown outerbevel. 
</s><s>here is a sample of this method in illustrator in comparison to the bevel layer style in phtooshop. 
</s><s>photoshop is clearly better, but in illustrator, this method still looks pretty good.</s><s> it at least looks good enough to get your type set the way you want it before converting to parths and tweaking your final image. 
</s><s>don't forget, once you get your style setup in appearance, you need to create a new graphic style and then you can easily apply it to any text object. 
</s><s>also, play with adding svgblur transformations to the two fx layers for smoother beveling. 
</s><s>not sure if this answers your question or if this helps or not. 
</s><s>best wishes, 
jase
