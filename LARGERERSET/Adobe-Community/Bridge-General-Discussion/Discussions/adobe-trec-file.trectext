<s>your suggestion seems to work and makes sense: select a specific keyword (e.g.</s><s> "wedding") from the filter panel create a new, temporary keyword (in the keywords panel) to have something to organize those photos by (when the original one is gone), for instance "wedding----" select all the photos (cmd/ctrl-a) which are currently displayed (i.e. all the "wedding" photos in this example) uncheck the current (but misplaced) keyword (e.g.</s><s> "wedding") for all those photos from the keywords panel delete the misplaced keyword (e.g.</s><s> "wedding") from the keywords panel select the "wedding---" keyword from the filter panel (the same photos should show, but with a different, temporary keyword).</s><s> create a new keyword you want to use, this time putting it in the right place (e.g.</s><s> "wedding", but in a different location in the keyword list shown in the keywords panel select all the photos (cmd/ctrl-a) which are currently displayed (i.e. all the "wedding---" photos in this example) check (assign) all those photos with the new, correctly located keyword (e.g.</s><s> "wedding") in the keywords panel uncheck the temporarily used "wedding---" keyword for all those photos in the keywords panel delete the temporary keyword (e.g.</s><s> "wedding---")

<s>thanks i figure this information might be useful for others as well, hence the step-by-step guide. 
</s><s>being in the process of cleaning up (removing keywords which aren't used in the list, removing "temporary helper keywords" (e.g.</s><s> "wedding---" from the example above) i figured a smart way to figure out which keywords have/haven't been used in all photos within a main folder: 
in case that main folder has sub-folders, be sure to display all of them as well (view-show items from sub-folders) once all the photos are shown (in the "content" panel) select them all (ctrl/cmd-a) in the keyword list ("keywords" panel) you should see a [ - ] (hyphen) next to each keyword which has been used.</s><s> this means some of the selected photos use those keywords.</s><s> a tick [ ﾃ ] character on the other hand means all of the selected photos use that specific keyword.</s><s> those keywords not having a [ - ] or [ ﾃ ] next to them means those keywords haven't been used anywhere among the selected photos, so you can safely delete those keywords from the list. 
</s><s>this procedure is also helpful in determining if you have several instances of the same keyword, but at different places in the list.</s><s> use the temporary keyword to fix this problem.</s><s> for instance; you find that the keyword "boat" has been used in two places: 
transportation boat 
and 
other keywords boat 
in order to fix this do the following (once you've located which keywords have been duplicated): (in the "filter" panel), select the first instance (i.e.</s><s> "transportation-boat").</s><s> be sure all those photos are selected (ctrl/cmd-a) now select (or create first, then select) the temporary keyword you want to use (e.g.</s><s> "boat---") so that they all get that temporary keyword now for the second keyword: next, (in the "filter" panel again). select the second instance of the same keyword (i.e.</s><s> "other keywords-boat").</s><s> now select all those photos (ctrl/cmd-a) select the temporary keyword ("boat---" so that all the selected photos get that temporary keyword now for the deletion of those duplicated keywords: (in the "filter" panel), choose the keyword temporary keyword ("boat---") for both instances of the "boat" keyword, then select all photos displayed with that filter (ctrl/cmd-a) (in the "keywords" panel), locate the first instance of "boat" you want to delete, then remove the [ ﾃ ] next to it.</s><s> the small box should now be empty.</s><s> when this is done you can safely delete that keyword in the "keywords" panel locate the second instance of the same keyword.</s><s> it's probably deselected (because you just removed all instances of the exact same spelling of the same keyword).</s><s> if you're happy with the location of the other instance of this keyword then just enable it for all the selected photos (so that a [ ﾃ ] is shown next to it.</s><s> if you don't want to keep that keyword where it is, then just delete that one as well (make sure it's not used for any photos (you should see an empty box next to it) now create the same keyword ("boat") exactly where you want it in the list of keywords make sure all the photos within that filter are selected (ctrl/cmd-a), then apply the new "boat" keyword for all of them 
the temporary keywords might be useful to keep until you're 100% sure everything is fine.</s><s> you can quickly and easily remove all of them by un-ticking each of their boxes one by one when you're displaying (and have selected) all the photos from the folder/sub-folders, then deleting them one by one. 
</s><s>please feel free to comment the above if i've made any mistakes or you have something to add. 
</s><s>yammer: i didn't quite understand what the occasional italicized keyword means.</s><s> something tells me they are keywords found in the photos but aren't included in the keyword list.</s><s> is this correct?</s><s> i assume this also means i can remove them in the same way as above, by first selecting all the photos containing them, unchecking the italicized keyword, then finally deleting it.</s><s> seems to work fine, so i hope it won't cause any issues further down the line...

</s><s>the failed images were spread across 3 of the 7 selected directories.</s><s> trying the same thing 30 minutes later resulted in the same errors.</s><s> trying each failed image individually gave the same error (either as part of the collection, or from it's own folder).

</s><s>to answer your questions directly: 1.</s><s> i have never experienced this problem keywording files individually (apart from after the errors, as mentioned above), but then i wouldn't usually be selecting lots of images to keyword individual images.</s><s> 2. yes, i always wait for the spinning circles to disappear, sometimes even longer!</s><s> 3.</s><s> i just tried applying keywords to a single folder of 102 images, and 2 failed to update.</s><s> so the answer is no, it fails at real locations too.</s><s> 4. windows 7 professional 64-bit, running on intel core2 duo and 4gb ram.</s><s> same thing happened before on a windows xp professional pc, running on an intel pentium 4 and 2gb ram and a single hard drive.

<s>i've done some more experimentation this morning, and i think i'm getting closer to the cause of the problem. 
i have a batch of 460 photos in several folders which i have duplicated in two other locations.</s><s> on keywording, the metadata occurs in the same files in each location, so the location is not the problem, it's the files.</s><s> in every case, modifying one parameter in camera raw will fix the metadata error.</s><s> the only thing that changes is the file's sidecar. 
i have done a text diff on several xmp files, before and after camera raw use, and there are several things besides the intentional change which happen... 
1.</s><s> the metadata date and instance id are updated.</s><s> 2. the history list is appended to.</s><s> 3. the default lens profile details are added (6 parameters) 4. the crop parameters are updated 
i don't think the lens profile changes are significant because files which produced no metadata error had no additional lens profile details either. 
</s><s>it is the last one of these which i think is significant.</s><s> in all files i tried (failed or not), the crop parameters had changed after an update of a single trivial basic setting (e.g.</s><s> recovery or clarity), even though the crop wasn't touched!</s><s> i noticed that all the failed photos had a crop - apart from one.</s><s> i checked the uncropped photo's xmp file before and after a setting change, and, interestingly, the before version had crop settings and the after version had none!</s><s> i had previously thought that it might be only the cropped files which gave the problem, but was proved wrong - it now seems that even uncropped files can have crop data. 
</s><s>so, my conclusion is that bridge throws up the metadata error because it cannot parse the xmp data.</s><s> certainly in my case, a problem in the crop metadata seems to be the cause, and the best way to fix this is by allowing camera raw to parse and re-save the data. 
</s><s>the questions are: why/how is the crop data wrong, and how can it be fixed without opening each individual file?</s><s> maybe i need to open 20,000 images in bridge, change an unused parameter then change it back again?</s><s> who's to say the probem won't reoccur later?

</s><s>it occurred to me that the bridge cache, which is stored in a folder on the hard drive, not only contains generated jpegs at thumbnail, preview and (optionally) 100% sizes, but it must also contain a keyword cache.</s><s> why else would bridge include an "indexing" facility?</s><s> it makes sense that, not only are the images cached, but some of their metadata is too, and it is this metadata cache which is used for searches and collections.</s><s> i can't prove this, but as a someone who has written code for a living, it makes sense. 
</s><s>if bridge is having trouble accessing cached records in certain circumstances (searches/collections), then this may exhibit the symptoms of being unable to access the real data, as well as thinking that image previews need regenerating.</s><s> it could also explain why some images' xmp appear to be unwriteable: maybe it's the "metadata cache" which is unwriteable, hence certain images only failing on my computer.

<s>not being a mac person, i'm not sure i understand your posts.</s><s> you have found a correlation between file attributes and the problem, but not the xmp data itself? 
</s><s>what happens if you make a camera raw adjustment to a problem image, does this change the problem attribute? 
</s><s>our best guess on the windows side is that bridge is getting its internal database out of sync with reality, although it's difficult to tell for sure because there is no specific error reporting. 
i have noted myself that my collection of xmp sidecar files, which have been built up over 4 years, starting with acr4, often look slightly different, as they have been untouched or updated with different versions of acr for different adjustments.</s><s> i don't know if inconsistencies in xmp structure, or a flaw in database management causes the metadata error to start, but in my case i strongly suspect that it is the database management.</s><s> this because, i can almost guarantee the problem starts with searches and collections, where bridge must have to build tables of file data from its database.

<s>i never notied that icon before, and i've been using bridge for 7 years. 
</s><s>usually, when you have no image previews for raw files, this means that your camera raw plug-in is older than your camera.</s><s> people always come across this problem when they use a new camera with older software. 
</s><s>to be sure, we need to know which camera you are using, and which version of camera raw.</s><s> to save typing this out for the three-thousandth time, please follow this page which i wrote earlier: http://yphotography.co.uk/articles/get-adobe-camera-raw-acr-open-photo s/
