<subject>Disabling autoplay using an action</subject>
<post author="Bart Van de Wiele" timestamp="Mar 22, 2014 4:27 AM">
<s>hi, 
</s><s>i'm working on an interactive banner.</s><s> the banner cycles and loops through 6 images on autoplay, each with a 3 sec delay between pictures.</s><s> i would also like to add a "previous image" and "next image" arrow for people who want to skip some of the images, or wish to go back to one in case the autoplay is too fast / slow for some people. 
i can make all this work (both autplay and the button navigation) but encounter a problem.</s><s> as a user behaviour, i'd like to make sure that the moment you use any of the arrows (meaning, switch to "manual navigation"), the autoplay function stops.</s><s> right now i have the behaviour where the banner keeps on playing, even though you manually switch to a different image.</s><s> i want to stop the autoplay behaviour the moment you touch any of the navigation buttons. 
i haven't been able to find any code that is able to stop the autoplay option on command.</s><s> so apart from using a "play" or "play-reverse" command, the buttons must also do something like "disable autoplay" for the main timeline.

</s><s>however, the example requires there to be a "select" event in the svg file, and an event listener in the edge animate file.</s><s> i am dealing with a somewhat different scenario, and i would love your help to figure it out. 
i have an svg map of the usa, and when the map loads, i would like each of the states (separate elements in the svg) to be colored differently based on data in the edge animate file.</s><s> this code from the tutorial references an element when it is being passed in by the select event...

} ); 
...but how can i reference an svg element directly on load without an event trigger?

<s>okay so more digging has revealed this which i am not sure if it is any help, but here goes.   we think that it's in some way related to javascript timers within the edge html files causing issues under the uiwebview in ios 6.</s><s> we expect any html which runs ok on mobile safari to also run within the ios uiwebview - albeit less speedily since javascript is processed more slowly in uiwebview than in safari, but it fails to load.   from a post at  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12529286/ios6-uiwebview-css3d-trans forms-are-not-hw-accelerated   --------- right now, it seems like these elements are being hardware accelerated, but that there's a bug in apple's low-level pipeline which kills performance.</s><s> i've tried a number of workarounds for hardware acceleration, and it seems that anything which invokes the gpu on ios5.1 causes a massive slowdown on ios6.   it seems that ios6 has broken the performance of css3  transforms, as compared to ios5.1, very badly.   ----------   css transforms are indeed a lot slower in ios 6, at least in my application on iphone 4.</s><s> i set basic translate() to element, instead of translate3d(), and performance stayed the same, so i think even translate3d() no longer triggers gpu acceleration.</s><s> that sounds like a bug.   as a workaround, i tried setting a different css properties (like rotate3d(), scale3d(), perspective, ...</s><s>) on element, but neither of them seems to trigger hardware acceleration.   -----------   try replacing all instances of -webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0); with -webkit-perspective: 1000; -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;.</s><s> this worked for me.</s><s> it's seems that -webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0); no longer invokes hardware acceleration.   -----------   this is above my level of knowledge / experience has anyone else had problems or ultimately found a solution i would be hugely grateful.

<subject>How to style a large block of text?</subject>
<post author="danstein01" timestamp="Mar 20, 2014 9:56 AM">
<s>i'm working with a large block of text (several paragraphs) which requires a considerable amount of styling - it contains bolded headlines and subheads, an unordered list, and various other elements which need very particular text styling.</s><s> i have the entire block styled in dreamweaver, and i'm hoping there's a way i can insert the entire chunk of text, including formatting, into an element in my adobe edge animate banner. 
i have tried going into stage.compositionready, and using this code: 
sym.$("isi").html("my styled html here"); 
this works if i insert a single line with minimal styling, but when i try to insert my entire block of html, it just breaks - nothing shows up in that element when i preview the banner. 
</s><s>is there any way i can accomplish this?

</s><s>second : merge your chapters (projects) i think the mess part of your project is this part that user should go to a seperate page to see the next chapter, you can make all chapers happen in one project and then user can change chapters inside the project and i think this way is more better, cause users will not get loading for every chapter then

<s>i have one of two things i would do, either move the comic to youtube, video is farrrr more effective and efficient means for what you want imho.</s><s> or you can practice drawing stuff with css shapes, i.e www.dd-c.us. 
i have done sprite-sheets in c++,c#,java,javascript and several other languages, i have done allllot of game programming in general, if its one thing i can tell you is... if you know what your doing i.e how to program, its not a bad solution. 
</s><s>otherwise its a time consuming process making every sheet ( sizing aligning, etc, and even then... your still using images which from an programming prospective is a last resort thing. 
</s><s>don't ignore my advice on video, you can use short clips to simulate a comic and link in a menu like i have done in: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbfjknmonaw 
understand from a numbers perspective h264 is amazing at compression, you could have all the content you want, you just need to learn basic premiere or whatever u fancy if u go that route.</s><s> make one video and compare sizes of a folder of images and a whole video (h264 compression) with all of them exactly how you want....

<s>well rillani 
the idea of merging all page in one project is very good, and for update you just need to upload 3 js files with new images files every month and that is better... 
but i need to know about your project, is it unlimited project ?</s><s> i mean maybe it gets 400 pages or more at the end ? 
if it is, you can use edge commons to make every page seperately but working together in one project, this way visual is same .. also every page can have loading, its very simple and easy look this sample http://edgedocks.com/edgecommons goto composition loader section

<s>hi joe, 
</s><s>i've been following your discussion with mark.</s><s> the same scenario with me - my files are residing in a dropbox folder.</s><s> while it works from my home computer (where i started the project), it will not work on my office computer through dropbox.</s><s> by not working , i mean that the images don't load - animation is there - but no images.</s><s> ideally it should have a function such as indesign or illustrator where you can 're-link' your assets.</s><s> as an experiment, i tried to change the names of some image files in the assets folder and the application did recognise that a change was made - so the links are there - even when you reveal in finder...but for some reason the images do not display in the animation. 
</s><s>even when i copy everything to my desktop from dropbox on to the office computer, it still does not work and i know no way to re-link assets. 
am i missing something?

<s>joel has been pretty thorough here... but should you still have problems with your build then feel free to let me know. 
i tested your live html and modified it to center the comp on screen, so if all you want is to center the composition you have to simply change the "width: 1350px;" to "width: 1000px;" in the style tag so that it will read: 
<style type="text/css"><!--#stage {top: 10px; height: 700px; width: 1000px; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;}--></style> 
</s><s>then like i said earlier you need to add a "wrapping" div around all the html contained withing the <body>...</body> tags.</s><s> you need to set that div to be the one with its id set to the value of "stage" like in: 
<body...</s><s>> <audio id="myaudio"...</s><s>> <audio id="fx"...</s><s>> 
</s><s><div id="stage"> 
...all your exising html code remains intact here ... 
</div> 
</body> 
</s><s>the parts in bold green is what you should modify as instructed while the part in bold red are new lines of code you would need to add to your page. 
i don't know how you are working within edge so i can't tell you how you should be modifying the project, but from the code that's been output i was able to make those simple modification/addition et voilà, all got centered 
i hope things will be a bit clearer now but if now don't be shy and keep ask ;d

<s>you can try with something like: 
sym.$('#stage').css({'margin-left':'25%', 'margin-right':'25%', 'width':'550', 'position':'absolute', 'bottom':'0px' 'text-align':'center'}); 
that should place your div id="stage" at the bottom and assuming your stage width is 550 px then it will maintain a that div at the bottom and centered. 
</s><s>if you want to all sizing proportionally you could use width:50% but that will crop the content visually and if your content required overflow-x to remain hidden it won't work, but you don't need to hide the overflow-x then you could use a combination like setting the margin left and right to 15% and the content to 70% to add up to 100% of the width and have the content remain always in the center bottom area (though when browser window get resized to anything that won't fit what you need to display at the bottom, that content will be "cropped". 
</s><s>other than doing it this quick way, you would need a combination of containters and wrappers... better tried than explained ;p i hope the info above will help you and should something be unclear ask away. 
</s><s>cheers!</s><s> tfbkny 
ps: i find it rather idiotic that w3c continues to ignore something so simple that was already available in the past.</s><s> it should be as easy as implementing instructions such as align:center; and anchor:bottom; which ridiculously enough don't exist yet even after several iterations of css.</s><s> we still need to do acrobatic bs backflips and know some secret masonic handshakes to accomplish something so extremely simple.</s><s> why in the past we could simply write the attribute align="center" and css left that behind relegating it to the unreliable margin:auto it's rather surprising to put it mildly.

<s>you would do that in the code window.

</s><s>about the resizing i don't think i get what you mean...</s><s> a square will remain a square when you resize the window.</s><s> if you want a fixed size square, just draw a square and use the position and size in the properties panel to the left.</s><s> if you want that to scale simply use percentage values instead of pixels.</s><s> if you want to place an image inside the square, turn that into a simbol then edit the symbol (double-clicking on it or right-clicking and choosing edit "symbol name"), import an image to place it into the square symbol and you'll have your square image.</s><s> i don't think you are talking about scaling the image itself since scaling gif images would truly be quite a nonsense ;p

<s>hi, dominico- 
</s><s>it sounds like you're trying to get your motion paths are resized when you resize the stage, right?</s><s> this will only work if your elements and paths are also described in percentage format.</s><s> if your logic can handle it - say, if your array describes a path and you keep a variable that is a multiplier based on the size of the stage - you can use the resize event to reset the multiplier and make it move correctly that way.</s><s> otherwise, you'll have pixel-based animation over a responsive stage.
