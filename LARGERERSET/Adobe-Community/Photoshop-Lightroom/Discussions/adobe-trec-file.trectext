<s>presumably they've written code which provides an alternative to what an sdk provides. http://www.dslrsoftware.com/tethered_shot.php:   most a99, a900, a850, a700 owner noticed that their cameras cannot be controlled by lightroom 5, 4 or 3.</s><s> konica minolta maxxum\dynax users barely hoped they ever shoot tethered in window vista or later versions.</s><s> mac os 10.8 owners was not be able to control pentax and samsung cameras.   we changed it   now you can control your sony alpha a99, a900, a850, a700, a7 and a7r camera directly from lightroom 5, 4 and 3 for windows 32/64 bit or mac os x. konica minolta maxxum\dynax 7d owners can shoot tethered into lightroom 3, 4 and 5 for windows 32/64 bit.</s><s> samsung and pentax owners can control theyi're cameras and transfer images to lightroom lightroom 5, 4 and 3 for windows 32/64 bit or mac os x. this can be achieved with a help of the dna software plug-in for lightroom 5, 4 or 3.   and if that's all they do, i guess they have the time and resources to invest in the work.   but adobe isn't alone here - phase one also provides no tethering support for sony bodies, for the same reason: http://www.phaseone.com/en/supported-cameras.aspx?camera=sony http://www.luminous-landscape.com/forum/index.php?topic=85754.0   you might want to have a look round the internet for advice on "watched folder" workarounds: that is, using other tethering software to get the image from camera to computer, and setting lightroom (or capture one, for that matter) up to watch the folder the tethering software brings the images into and automatically import them to lightroom: http://www.apertureguys.com/blog/1/7/2014/tethering-with-the-sony-a99

<s>if you don't have a calibrator that allows you to target a certain brightness, or your display simply doesn't go below a certain brightness, make sure you have enough ambient light around and that the ambient light is good quality (no yellow incadescents!</s><s>) with high color temperature.</s><s> one strategy is to use a piece of blank paper and hold it to the side of your monitor or tape it to the wall behind.</s><s> then dial up your ambient lighting until the piece of paper is as bright as white on the display.</s><s> this is no match for a well calibrated setup, especially since this will make your shadow areas less well defined because of reflection and scattering of your screen, but it will make sure you don't develop your images too dark.</s><s> as your mind will have a reference that isn't - "wow that's bright, let's tone it down." this will ensure not just that your prints are the right brightness but also that your electronic output is not too dark.</s><s> using the print setting trick is a really bad idea in general as your non-print output will still be way too dark. 
</s><s>many times, with the current slate of very bright monitors, it is a bad idea to try to lower the intensity so much as to get to the recommended 100 cd/m2 or so as its spectral characteristics will shift considerably.

<s>i tried using 'export book to pdf' in the lr book module with 'book' set to 'blurb' and the pdf images are all tagged as srgb profile and 8-bit color.   suggestion if you set 'book' to 'pdf' under 'book setting' you can use adobe rgb profile, 300 ppi, and your own sharpening selection, which as andrew rodney mentioned is a better choice.</s><s> you can submit the lr exported pdf at blurb's 'pdf to book' upload page and they will do the proper cmyk conversion on their end.</s><s> the only issue is that the images are still exported in the lr book module as 8-bit color jpegs.</s><s> this may cause banding with a wider gamut profile, but that should be apparent when reviewing the exported book pdf.   here are some comments from blurb concerning using blurbs 'pdf to book' workflow, which is similar to what i just described:   from me: my workflow details:   my objective is to process all images in lr4 and then export them as 300 dpi, prophoto rgb profile, 16 bit tiff images for layout in indesign using blurb's indesign plugin (blurb book creator cs6 v2.0.2.34d8).</s><s> i will soft proof the placed images inside indesign using its 'proof colors' tool and the blurb_icc_profile.icc profile.</s><s> once the indesign layout is complete i will do the rgb to cmyk blurb_icc_profile conversion during the export to pdf process using the blurb pdf x-3 export preset v1-1.   blurb's resonse: response via email(david) - 07/18/2012   using indesign and our blurb indesign plug-in does mean you're using the pdf to book workflow.</s><s> this is because your indesign files will ultimately be exported/uploaded as pdf files.   regarding, "once the indesign layout is complete i would like to do the rgb to cmyk blurb_icc_profile conversion during the export to pdf process":     unfortunately, there is no option for this and it's actually unnecessary during the export process.</s><s> our printers convert and process all images as cmyk using the blurb icc color profile, so even if you upload/export them with an rgb color profile, they'll be converted to cmyk for the production process.   my response: customer by email - 07/19/2012 05:10 am thanks for the explanation david.</s><s> it sounds like i can just upload the pdf file using my prophoto rgb profiled pdf, but i would prefer to do the conversion from prophoto rgb to blurb icc cmyk profile.</s><s> this way i can see the results before uploading the file to blurb.</s><s> can i use the blurb pdf x-3 export preset v1-1 with output > color conversion to destination > blurb cc profile, and then upload the pdf file myself?</s><s> if so please advise where i should upload the file on the blurb website.   blurb's response: response via email(david) - 07/20/2012 03:49 pm hi todd, if you do end up exporting your pdfs with the workflow you're referring to, you can upload your files here: http://www.blurb.com/make/pdf_to_book   imho there's no reason why adobe and blurb couldn't work together so prophoto rgb 16-bit images can be used in the book pdf that gets uploaded (or exported!</s><s>) to blurb's website.</s><s> blurb then handles the cmyk conversion using full-gamut 16-bit images and not clipped srgb 8-bit images.

</s></quote>andrew, thanks for helping understand how to "break out of the box" and not assume any recommended calibration target is best. 
</s><s>just to clarify, the tutorial which recommended a target brightness setting of 100 was not directly from x-rite, but rather a webinar put on by mac groups (in partnership with x-rite) many years ago.</s><s> but you've helped me recall that 100 was a suggested starting point, not necessarily a brightness target for good and forever! 
</s><s>the good news is that for 3 years now, i've successfully used the x-rite to calibrate to that desired brightness level and i've successfully printed both at home and pro lab prints which come back exactly as desired, so their "recommended starting point" has been working for me, up to now. 
</s><s>my concern has arisen becase now i'm moving from the realm of conventional photo prints to press books and there seems to be soooooo much hub-bub about the problems getting color, shadow, and highlight accuracy.</s><s> all because blurb does not offer any "real" information about specific profiles for specific papers. 
i also agree, based on all the logic presented, that it is a moot point to even bother trying to soft-proof to blurb's icc profile, since it is a bogus, generic profile which is not specific to the individual papers on which the book is to be printed. 
</s><s>ultimately, i'm coming to believe my best bet for getting good results is to follow the advice for #1 - a small test book of some of the most vital photos, including ones most likely to be out of gamut, and also #2, once the full book is created, uploading to pdf first to see how happy i am with the results.

<s>the blurb wedding album book i created within lightroom's book module came out fantastic! 
i ended up using srgb jpegs to create the book, since no matter what i used, the images would be converted to this color space and image format upon upload from the book module to blurb. 
i used a freshly color calibrated display, using an x-rite colormunki, right before making final exposure, color, and black clipping adjustments directly from within the book module. 
i then created a test pdf within lightroom first and was very happy with the result, so i took the plunge and went ahead and ordered two copies of the album straight from lightroom.</s><s> didn't even bother with printing a test book.

<s>hi barb, 
</s><s>the "normal" method for synchronizing changes between catalogs is to export new/changed photos to a catalog, then import that catalog on the other machine.</s><s> i say "normal" because it's not the only way. 
</s><s>when you export as catalog, it considers the options you've checked, then creates a new catalog which has all the develop settings and other metadata for the photos. 
</s><s>when importing catalog, it updates the catalog being imported into using information from the catalog being imported - again: there are options to say "how" you want it done. 
</s><s>if you've never tried it, now is the time to do so - flexibility is limited, but it's generally quite painless and can do exactly what you want done. 
</s><s>that does not solve the problem of exported tiffs & jpegs having the exact same hierarchical keywords as the original (e.g. raw).</s><s> for that, you'll need to use one of the other techniques mentioned, e.g.</s><s> export master or syncing metadata after exporting (and adding back to catalog). 

</s><s>more specific answers to your specific questions: 
<quote>
<s>barblm wrote: 
should i only be using lightroom "export" to create jpegs and tiffs 
</s></quote>yes - the only way to create a tif or jpg is by exporting (assuming the original is not already tif or jpg, in which case you could just make a copy if that's what you wanted..</s><s>).</s><s> 

</s><s><quote>
<s>barblm wrote:

</s></quote>if you want to export a tiff or jpeg and have identical keywords as original master, then export somewhere (wherever you want them, so you don't have to copy them again), and check the 'add to catalog' box.</s><s> if you use export master then the only additional step will be to dismiss a dialog box, if you don't use exportmaster, then you'll have to sync keyword metadata with original as outlined above.

<s>i found that the lightroom (including v2.3 rc) has a weird processing of the blue color on my camera – canon eos 450d. after the exposure increase the blue goes to purple: i created a test image: http://img19.imageshack.us/img19/5580/testt.png to see this issue take a shot of this image (my monitor is color calibrated eizo) while little out-of-focus to prevent moire.</s><s> you will get something like this: http://rapidshare.com/files/203548885/img_1960.cr2 cool.</s><s> open the raw image in lightroom and try to increase the exposure to +2.00.</s><s> you will get this: http://img100.imageshack.us/img100/9797/img1960h.jpg do you see the purple part in the first line that should be blue?</s><s> try the same correction in any other raw processor and you will see only pure blue without any purple.</s><s> so what is wrong with lightroom?</s><s> yes, you can correct the purple issue by calibrating the blue color in the lightroom but i don't want to mess up the blue to correct this issue.</s><s> the camera alone has no problem with increasing the exposure to +2 with the same shot: http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/1267/img1959.jpg there is no difference if you shoot to srgb or adobergb for this issue.</s><s> some of my friends also told me they are not using lightroom because they get purple sky when processing raws from canons.</s><s> why i do such silly tests?</s><s> it's simple.</s><s> download this raw: http://rapidshare.com/files/203548884/_mg_1890.cr2 try to correct the exposure in lightroom while retaining the blue backlight.</s><s> it's hard work!</s><s> and again – other raw processors have no problems with this file.

<s>hi folks!   i allready wrote in the beta time in the therad about that lr4 beta was sluggish.</s><s> i wrote this:   i installed lr4 beta today on 3 machines.</s><s> i worked on 5dmkii raw files. dng and cr2 files.   here are the hardware settings:   1: i7 930 overclocked to 3.8ghz , 128gb ssd as boot disk, 3 raid 0 disks (6 x 1.5tb) for datas and as scratch disk for cash and so one, 12gb ram, nvidia gtx570, win7 x64 ultimate 2: same as nr one, just a quadro 4000 as grapics card.</s><s> 3: mac pro with 2 intel xeon 6 core prozessors, 12gb ram and ati hd 5870, osx 10.7.2 lion   conclusion.</s><s> when working in process 2010, everything works realtime, fluid, perfekt. switching to process 2012 it is simply awful. moving a slider and 1/2 - to 1 second untill i can see the results in the pictures. it gets realy bad, when i turn on the sharpness and the lens correction. it is simply not possible to work on this piece of software. completely useless at this stage.   these are pretty high end machines with a lot of power.</s><s> i know lr4 is beta, but the performance must grow about 800%, or lr4 will be useless for a smooth workflow.   i just red, that a person called cow answered in this thread that lr4 is fine now and fast!</s><s> i tried to reply in that thread, but now that thread is set to read only for me, so i have to write here.   i installed the software on all these 3 machines today.</s><s> i imported the catalogue and ...bam. sluggish like hell. unbelievable.</s><s> 7d files and 550d files are a little bit faster but hell it is still sloooowwww.   i did the trick like lee told me in the other thread and i tried to import fresh and clean cr2 files driectly to the 2012 process. like in the beta it became a liiitttlleee bit more fluid. but just a little bit. so i decided to clean my complete preview database and my cache and let it completele rebuilt.</s><s> i did that on my mac pro dualprozessor machine which runs on 10.7.3 lion. lr4 is installed on a samsung 500mb/sec ssd and the pure cache disk is another ssd wird 128gb. just for cache and preview database and catalogue.</s><s> i think this is quite as fast as it can be.   so i completely renewed everything and.....again.</s><s> a little bit faster but agins much to slow.   when you have the lens correction turned off and sharpness turned off, it is likely useable. when you turn on a second monitor it beginns to get slower. when you add lens correction and detail/sharpness........bam. slow as hell.</s><s> i recognized the cpu usage and saw that the usage was unter 8% on all 12 cores.</s><s> no cpu usage and unbelievable slow?</s><s>?</s><s>?</s><s> working in lr3 is completely flawless. not one stuttering or anything.</s><s> i am completely not satisfied with this piece of software - sorry!   i heard a trick from a friend of mine who told me, that not the cpu power is important. lr4 uses the ram and the faster the ram is, the faster is lr4. so we built in a new ram from 12gb up to 24gb. the old ram had 1330mhz and the new one had 1800mhz. the speed raised up but it is still not completele fluid. when i did some adjustments to a picture, the sliders become unbelievable slow, as more and more you move them. on all my machines.   adobe, i really like lr and i grew up with this product.</s><s> i allready even bought the upgrade. but no...this is not a piece oft software that can be used for a fluid und fast workflow. it can be used for single pictures to create really good results....yes, but not for a fast and fluid workflow what lightroom once stood for.   sorry to say that but you have not completed the mission. it was a failure. having lr4 and a user who prefers lr3.6 should not be the goal!   resolve these problems please as fast as you can guys!   king regards frank!

<s>keep in mind that if you're using a 32-bit windows os including windows 7, the os can only use about 3 gb or maybe 3.5 gb of ram, no matter how much you load onto the pc.</s><s> so if lr3 is slow on your system with 2 gb of ram,and that wouldn't be a huge surprise especially if you have a large catalog and a 2+ year old pc, it may not be much better even if you upgrade your ram to 8 gb, unless you also do a reformat and reinstall to a 64-bit windows os.</s><s> doing that may cause other issues with other software.</s><s> for example, i also use adobe audition, and comments on the adobe support forum for those who have tried audition with 64-bit win7 seem divided between those who run it fine and those who can't run it well at all.</s><s> your hardware drivers also may or may not support 64-bit windows.a 64-bit os is great with hardware and software that can run it, likely including lr3 and ps cs5, but ymmv with your other apps and your gear.

<s>this is not a statement of what i would like to see, but what i think adobe might be working on 
i first purchased lightroom when the current version was lightroom 2.</s><s> in each major version, we have seen dramatic improvements in some of the tools in lightroom regarding image quality.</s><s> so, from lr2 to lr3, we saw dramatic improvements in noise removal.</s><s> from lr3 to lr4, we got a whole new process version, which produced huge improvements in image quality leading one person (rob cole) to say it was like "seeing with new eyes".</s><s> from lr4 to lr5 we got a lot of new tools, each one not particularly dramatic but useful in its own way: enhanced spot healing, radial filter, upright. 
</s><s>so, my reading between the lines tells me that image quality is one of the primary concerns of adobe when deciding how to improve lightroom.</s><s> furthermore, if you looks at competitor's web sites (dxo, capture one, and so on), they all claim to produce outstanding image quality, and i can understand how adobe does not want to fall behind in this area.</s><s> in one example, dxo claims it can improve "lens softness" via "automatically improving and homogenizing image sharpness from the center to the edges, even when you push the settings", whatever that means.</s><s> i haven't actually used dxo, so i can't evaluate this claim but i don't think lightroom can do that right now.</s><s> perhaps this is something lightroom will have in lr6. 
</s><s>anyway, that's my speculation of where lr is heading ... additional image quality improvement tools.</s><s> some of the image quality issues mentioned above by others in this thread may indeed be on the list of lr6 enhancements, although the specific form of the tool may be different in lr than it is in cs6.

<s>the lr design team or rather the adobe policy setters who direct their work, meaning thomas knoll who, apparently, still maintains strict control, has something of a problem.</s><s> lr was originally conceived as a tool for the large volume professional - wedding, events, sports, etc. - but has become increasingly popular with lower volume professionals - landscape, portrait, product and fashion, fine art - and advanced amateurs.</s><s> so which segment do they play to now?</s><s> i think they may well see the greatest chance for market expansion in the amateur direction, even at the risk of undercutting sales of pse.</s><s> a feature like hdr appeals primarily to the amateur market (the professional fine art landscapers are probably relatively few in number) and this group is less likely to have the budget for pscc, but more likely to be using the photomatix plugin or similar.</s><s> it should be very possible for lr to incorporate ps's blend to hdr into the export module, generating a 32 bit tiff for tonemapping.</s><s> as to layering, it is already possible to apply multiple filters and brush applications one on top of another, but it is not very easy to return to them later to alter them (possible but not easy).</s><s> making them more like smart filters would help.</s><s> and of course any expansion of their functionality would be welcome; hsl, vibrance, curves, etc.</s><s> a few other things; it would be nice to see more use of the content aware technology in the healing tool and refine edges in the brush selections.

<s>regarding speculation: 
i agree that adobe is particularly keen to have changes to develop aimed at image quality and usability in acr (photoshop/bridge) too.</s><s> dxoh's lens softness adjustment is not as keen as you might hope for - they've profiled the lenses well-enough to have a good map of how sharpness falls off based on lens/aperture..., but the correction is pretty weak: i get get better results in lightroom by correcting sharpness falloff with a brush (larger radius sharpening is better toward the edges..</s><s>) - granted it takes more work - having that automated (with proper directional correction more akin to "focus magic" (deconvolution) than simple sharpening) would be a boon to "image quality", to be sure..

<s>hi 
</s><s>i agree with your comments but the worse part of an adobe one year release schedule is they abandon the old version and only the new version supports new cameras.</s><s> this is especially true for photographers in the know that almost exclusively use raw files as you cannot use the newer adobe camera raw (acr) and are obliged to convert to dng format.</s><s> the issue is that adobe are rather 'up themselves' as a company and arrogant to boot.</s><s> historically pride comes before a fall and this is true of software companies if they longterm abuse cutomers and force them down paths they do not want to go (creative cloud).</s><s> i strongly suspect many companies are ploughing extra investment into image manipulation development areas to prepare to rival and perhaps better adobe's offering?</s><s> meanwhile adobe do rule the roost but i was very impressed with the free gimp software that used to be nerdy but is now more accessible.</s><s> still not easy to use but powerful.

</s><s>by network intelligence i mean for the catalog?</s><s> i dont have lr6 but my understanding is the catalog cannot be on another machine on a network (server)?</s><s> great news if it is. 
</s><s>by font size i thought most development companies (of software) had enabled their products for the disabled?</s><s> but thanks for the pointer to jeffrey friedl's online lightroom configurator, something i was unaware of. 
</s><s>quote "should be independant of creative cloud" - we will see how long this persists.</s><s> if you use standalone cs6 (creative suite production premium) as i do you will see many part implemented cc applications that just dont work but are deployed to me needlessly.</s><s> indeed i can make a decision (and i have) not to be trapped on the merry-go-round that is creative cloud.</s><s> while cc makes sense for large commercial users and those that always pass costs off to customers it makes no sense for the enthusiast.</s><s> even the dramatic price cutting adobe has been forced into to encourage uptake is risky as the adopter cannot control inevitable future price-rises but by then stand-alone photoshop (for example) will be unavailable? 
</s><s>quote "should support 16 bit images and processing" - my misunderstanding.</s><s> i know lr4 can import 16 bit images but is the print module outputting in 16 bit?</s><s> it might well be but something i read recently said not?</s><s> lr5 might well already do this but i am waiting for lr6 to upgrade.

<s>greetings tom, 
</s><s>i still see swapping/memory issues when viewing/rating quantities of images ( > 500).</s><s> lr does not appear to reuse preview memory; exiting the program and restarting does not "solve" the issue.</s><s> i too have been an lr user since early beta release pre-1.0. my machines have increased in power the entire time; and they have switched back and forth between pc and mac.</s><s> right now, i'm running a dual-quad core mac pro, 16gig of ram, internal scsi raid arrays and nvidia quadro fx5600 display driving two eizo 24" monitors.</s><s> i have recently upgraded from 10.5.8 to 10.6.5, with no change in the symptoms, so does not appear to be related to os version.</s><s> lr can not handle importing and sorting a days shoot of images without having to stop and reboot the machine partway through because 16 gig of memory is not enough.</s><s> if i am spending the day editing only a few dozen images, arranging collections, cropping, etc, then there is no problem.</s><s> it appears to be previewing (or some relation to it) that causes the problem. 
i can reproduce this issue without effort (just a bit of time to page through 500 images) repeatedly.</s><s> some where around 500 images, every 3rd image will cause a page fault and swap starts growing.</s><s> this is silly!</s><s> i understand if you wish to keep memory around for images that you have already seen, it speeds things up.</s><s> but when you reach the point where you start swapping rather than reusing memory, you are losing far more than you gain! 
</s><s>in other problems, i too tend to do heavy retouching in ps, because i have noticed that a lot of spot corrections ( > 100) cause the response to slow down massively.</s><s> to the point where i click and wait a couple of seconds before another dust correction circle shows up.</s><s> so for images that have a lot of dust (i had one set that i was shooting a harvest, dust everywhere, darn it!</s><s>) i do what i can in lr, as far as corrections go, then export to ps so it doesn't kill off lr.</s><s> but of course, doing that, i lose the raw functionality.</s><s> ah well.</s><s> not sure if that is an actual issue, since 99.99% of my images don't require dust correction like that; just mentioning it if you think it is an issue.

<s>to follow up what is still cropping up on the old thread, i agree with tk2142's latest post that lightroom 3's default balance of real to virtual memory seems to favor older computers with limited ram.</s><s> but limited ram is of diminishing importance these days, even on laptops, where 8 gb is not uncommon.</s><s> as a result, the program cannot make efficient use of systems with plenty of ram available.</s><s> designing for the lowest common denominator seems to me to be a short-sighted strategy at best.</s><s> for some time now photoshop has enabled people to allocate resources according to their own workflow needs.</s><s> indeed, photoshop cs5, in 64 bit mode, finally enables us to access more than 3 gb of ram.</s><s> likewise, it has been possible for many years in photoshop to designate the drive to be used for application swap files (virtual memory).</s><s> in my not so humble opinion, users would benefit immensely from such capabilities in lightroom.</s><s> certainly many of the problems people are reporting on these forums would be less severe if lightroom could be directed to better utilize available resources.</s><s> i can't imagine this issue hasn't occurred to the lightroom engineering team.</s><s> apparently, though, they are reluctant to address this matter.</s><s> i suspect perfecting the code alone cannot solve all the reported performance problems.</s><s> we need the same kind of flexibility in allocating resources for lightroom that we enjoy in photoshop.

<s>
</s><s>tom, 
</s><s>thanks for starting a new thread.</s><s> hopefully we can all keep this thread to constructive feedback.</s><s> i also posted this information on a similar thread relating only to the spot healing tool so sorry for the duplicate information. 

i am running w7, 64-bit, 12gb ram separate, internal raid arrays for os, cache and images, and dual quad-core processors with hyper-threading.</s><s> i designed the machine specifically for lr 2. still, with both 2.5 and 3.3rc loaded for testing, the time to process images is at least twice as slow for me in 3.3rc and that is without problems with the spot healing tool.</s><s> this is a non-scientific measure of how long i am sitting at my computer to finish a set of a similar number of images.</s><s> if i have scans with many spots utilized, the cost in performance is exponential relative to 2.5.</s><s> everyone's machine is of course different. 

i have filed a bug report for this when 3.0 first came out and have been in contact with adobe providing information to help isolate the problem.</s><s> adobe did improve the problem with 3.3rc (at least for my machine) in that it is now less likely to freeze, but it still slows down to a point where the spot tool is unusable after a large number of spots are implemented. 
</s><s>recently i opened a cpu monitor to watch when doing spot healing and noticed that when it "hangs" only one of the 16 cores is being used (other than a couple at say <5%) and it is stuck at 100%.</s><s> when the spot tool become useable again, it is immediately after the core usage drops below 100% again.</s><s> it is as if the multi-core ability of lr somehow fails when using the spot tool and therefore it becomes a noticeable problem when a large number of spots are placed on a single image.</s><s> not very scientific but may be a lead.</s><s> i also find that it hangs more likely when accidently changing the size of an existing spot when intending to add a spot instead. 
</s><s>in any case, lr is my product of choice and i am patiently awaiting 3.3 or 3.4 to get some performance back.</s><s> with the number of views on the old thread and the probably number of posts and views here, i have to assume that adobe is still working on this issue.</s><s> having the noise reduction overhaul of 3.0 is the feature that keeps 99% of my images non-destructive and thus i am not likely to return back to 2.5 unless adobe simply states that this issue cannot be resolved - in which case i will have to consider that possibility. 
</s><s>also, some have suggested that hardware might be an issue.</s><s> if indeed it is a component of my hardware that is no longer compatible when moving from 2.x to 3.x, i am more than willing to change-out that component - just need a little insight as to what to replace

<s>tom, it may be necessary (reading the trail below) to start another thread entitled - "definition of a release candidate - discuss..."

<s>windows 7 64-bit sp1 machine here.</s><s> yesterday, as most of you here, i had this error message with any external editor, and i posted a message in this forum.</s><s> at night, before going to bed, i installed an evaluation version of photoshop elements 10.</s><s> this morning i opened lightroom and, tada!, plugins work fine!</s><s> so definitely it is an adobe problem, lr must be missing some piece of software that pse has; note that i did not open pse at all after installing it yesterday night, so it has added the missing part during installation.</s><s> hope this helps adobe engineers to solve the problem.

<s>fixed!</s><s> under mac os x 10.7.3 had no other adobe product installed then lightroom; after upgrade to lr4 nik plugins did not work anymore. then i installed a demo adobe cs5 now the nik plugins work again; i think during the installation of cs5 the plugin-definition area is touched and so repaird it's not a nik software but an adobe problem

</s><s>this is consistent with what i explained.</s><s> installing pse changes the way the memory is organized because some additional programs are loaded in memory upon startup.</s><s> so lr is loaded at another address which may or may not have consequences on the way the bug manifests itself. 
</s><s>this is just my opinion as a former developer.</s><s> maybe i'm wrong and maybe installing pse or ps changes something else in the common files | adobe folder (a missing file as you suggested) but i doubt.</s><s> in that case, the problem would hit every user.
