<s>there are four basic steps needed to embed an edge animate composition into an existing page: Ê publish from edge animate.</s><s> (this creates the necessary files to run the animation.</s><s> also, the code referenced in step 2 and 3 below will be included in the .html file that animate creates inside the publish/web folder, which you can just copy/paste.</s><s>) add a <div> to the page that has the id of stage and the correct class name for your stage (i.e. the "composition id" for your project in animate).</s><s> for example:Ê <div id="stage" class="edge-1655086"></div> include the preload .js file and the default style in your page's header, within edge runtime html comments.</s><s> for example:Ê <!--adobe edge runtime--> <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="test-1655086_edgepreload.js"></script> <style> .edgeload-edge-1655086 { display:none; } </style> <!--adobe edge runtime end--> make sure to upload all of the include files to your server in the appropriate relative locations.</s><s> this includes the _edge.js files, _edgeactions.js file, _edgepreload.js file, the edge_includes folder and its contents, any other files/folders created inside the "publish/web" folder when you publish from edge animate (e.g.</s><s> "images" folder, etc.</s><s>). Ê Ê here is a very simple example that will hopefully help to clarify: http://thetraininggrounds.com/an-test/insert-an-into-existing-page.htm l Ê as a reference, these are all of the files involved in my example: an-test/insert-an-into-existing-page.html (my existing html page) an-test/ball-bouncing-banner_edge.js an-test/ball-bouncing-banner_edgeactions.js an-test/ball-bouncing-banner_edgepreload.js an-test/edge_includes/edge.1.0.0.min.js an-test/edge_includes/jquery.easing.1.3.js an-test/edge_includes/jquery-1.7.1.min.js an-test/edge_includes/json2_min.js

<s>forum question: "how do i get my form to send sensitive credit card data to my email address?" 
</s><s>forgive the rant, but i've been seeing lots of posts like this lately and frankly it leaves me terrified and irritated.</s><s> terrified for consumers who could be exploited by credit card & identity thieves.</s><s> terrified for site owners who could incur stiff penalties or be put out of business.</s><s> irritated with the fool of a web designer who thinks this is ok business practice. 
</s><s>i've got news for you.</s><s> it's not ok to transfer sensitive data by e-mail.</s><s> it's not secure. 
</s><s>if you're new to web design and need to build a store site for someone, please use paypal, google checkout or one of the industry approved shopping cart sites.</s><s> if you need a recommendation, feel free to post a question in the forum.</s><s> people here will be happy to share their opinions & experiences with you. 
q: what is pci?</s><s> a: the payment card industry data security standard (pci dss) is a set of requirements designed to ensure that all companies that process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment.</s><s> essentially any merchant that has a merchant id (mid). 
q: to whom does pci apply?</s><s> a: pci applies to all organizations or merchants, regardless of size or number of transactions, that accepts, transmits or stores any cardholder data. 
q: what are the penalties for noncompliance?</s><s> a: the credit card companies may, at their discretion, fine an acquiring bank $5,000 to $100,000 per month for pci compliance violations.</s><s> the banks will most likely pass this fine on downstream till it eventually hits the merchant.</s><s> in most cases though, the bank suspends or terminates the merchant's credit card privileges. 
i realize jobs are scarce & finding good projects to work on is much harder than it once was.</s><s> but that doesn't mean you should ever put yourself, the public and site owners at risk.</s><s> if a site owner insists on running his business without a pci compliant shopping cart to save a few dollars or [insert whatever excuse here], this is a red flag warning you to politely thank them & walk away from the project.</s><s> there is no excuse for not using a secure payment method.</s><s> paypal doesn't cost much (a small transaction fee) and it's very simple to set up.

<s>thanks curtis, adninjastrator and pz for your constructive input.</s><s> all excellent points. 
<start with the bank> 
</s><s>absolutely.</s><s> especially if the merchant already has pos (point of service) -- a brick & mortar shop where the credit card user is standing in front of him. 
</s><s>on-line merchants need a cnp (card not present) account.</s><s> fees for cnps are somewhat higher owing to greater risk of fraud & charge backs on the internet. 
</s><s>pos merchants have a gateway to process credit cards.</s><s> a physical terminal or box is connected to a phone line or internet cable and used at checkout to approve or decline purchases on the spot.</s><s> similarly, on-line merchants need an internet gateway to approve or decline purchases.</s><s> often the same gateway company can provide both services. 
</s><s>finally, on-line merchants need a shopping cart that is compatible with their internet gateway's protocol. 
</s><s>as pz said, any shopping cart can collect order details.</s><s> but only a pci compliant cart can collect customer data (card holder's name, address, credit card # & expiration date).</s><s> the level of encryption required for this standard is very high to safeguard customer data as it's being collected, stored and transmitted to the gateway. 
i prefer to hand off customers to a secure payment processing agent like https://paypal or https://authorize.net for order completion.</s><s> it costs a little more but it's much safer for me as a web developer and the site owner who is ultimately responsible for protecting his customer's data.</s><s> unless you really know what you're doing, it's much better to let the experts handle this step. 
@curtis, i've had good experiences with paypal.</s><s> but other options are good to know about.</s><s> especially for non-profits who may not be able to use paypal.</s><s> please post any others you've had good experiences with.

<s>pci compliance is of high concern to anyone selling online so you need to take some time learning about it, then work with your host,and you payment gateway provide and in some cases tweak your site to bring things into line.</s><s> keep in mind that the whole pci issue is still relatively new so there are many interpretations.</s><s> some merchant account providers will not accept anything short of a locked down dedicated server with all the security you can load up on it and will not pass anything on any shared host.</s><s> naturally this is overkill and an over reaction.</s><s> others are much more realistic, so it doesn't hurt to even spend some time shopping merchant accounts and pci certification vendors - and ask others that have gotten their site/s certified. 
</s><s>you can avoid the issue completely by handing off all the transaction to a payment provider, and for some sites this may be the perfect solution.</s><s> doing so does interrupt the flow of the check out and introduces the payment provides's branding into the process.</s><s> many prefer to have a seamless transaction for the customer.</s><s> not to worry, with some diligence you can provide this sort of user experience and be pci compliant.

<post author="riverWall86" timestamp="Mar 22, 2014 1:24 AM">
<s>hi, 
</s><s>i had a lightbox gallery extension that i used to use with my students for setting up image galleries in their websites. 
</s><s>it was great for the purpose but i have tried to use it in dreamweaver cc but with no luck. 
i have changed the file from an .mxp file to an .zxp file using extension manager cs6 and then imported the extension into extension manager cc. 
i can then see the extension in dreamweaver cc under tcn widgets in the insert palette, but the lightbox icon has a question mark on it, and i get javascript error messages when i try to insert it into a page. 
</s><s>does anyone have any thoughts on this? 
i started a thread in the extensions manager forum but it was suggested i try over here in the dreamweaver forum.

<s>first, the way you have to handle multiple columns is to wrap them in a larger div. 
</s><s>so you'll have a container with three divs, name them left, center, right. 
</s><s>so here are your styles in css: 
#container { width: 780px; /* using 20px less than a full 800px width allows for browser chrome and avoids a horizontal scroll bar */ background: #ffffff; margin: 0 auto; /* the auto margins (in conjunction with a width) center the page */ border: 1px solid #000000; text-align: left; /* this overrides the text-align: center on the body element. */ } .clearfloat { /* this class should be placed on a div or break element and should be the final element before the close of a container that should fully contain a float */ clear:both; height:0; font-size: 1px; line-height: 0px; } #left { float: left; /* since this element is floated, a width must be given */ width: 180px; /* the actual width of this div, in standards-compliant browsers, or standards mode in internet explorer will include the padding and border in addition to the width */ background: #ebebeb; /* the background color will be displayed for the length of the content in the column, but no further */ padding: 5px; /* padding keeps the content of the div away from the edges */ margin-top:15px; } #right { float: right; /* since this element is floated, a width must be given */ width: 280px; /* the actual width of this div, in standards-compliant browsers, or standards mode in internet explorer will include the padding and border in addition to the width */ background: #ffffff; /* the background color will be displayed for the length of the content in the column, but no further */ padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; /* padding keeps the content of the div away from the edges */ } #center { margin: 0 290px 0 190px; /* the right and left margins on this div element creates the two outer columns on the sides of the page.</s><s> no matter how much content the sidebar divs contain, the column space will remain.</s><s> you can remove this margin if you want the #maincontent div's text to fill the sidebar spaces when the content in each sidebar ends. */ padding: 0 10px; /* remember that padding is the space inside the div box and margin is the space outside the div box */ } 
</s><s>now, when you put together your html, you'll do this: 
<!</s><s>doctype html public "-//w3c//dtd xhtml 1.0 transitional//en" "http://www.w3.org/tr/xhtml1/dtd/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <head> <title>page title goes here</title> <link href="path/style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /> </head> <body> <div id="container"> <div id="header"> header goes here </div> <!-- end #header --></div> <div id="left"> left content here </div> <div id="right"> rightmost content goes here.</s><s> please note the middle section comes after the right section.</s><s> </div> <div id="center"> this is the center stuff and you will note that it has margins that keep it to the center.</s><s> </div> <!-- this clearing element should immediately follow the #center div in order to force the #container div to contain all child floats --><br class="clearfloat" /> <div id="footer"> footer stuff goes here and is as wide as the main container </div> </div> </body> </html>

<s>not sure if my input will help, but i am getting this same issue.</s><s> (windows 7 64bit 6gb ram, quad core processor dw cs5.5 studend version) 
i disabled search indexing on my machine a fair while ago, so i do not think that is the issue (for me anyway). 
i also note that this does not happen with simple pages (i.e non-database non-php non-js related pages). 
i also turned off discover pages, but i do have related files set to show. 
</s><s>once i say "no" to the error message, i get a second error stating "javascript error while loading repeatregion.htm.</s><s> the user chose to stop the script." 
</s><s>the page that i am working on has a connection to a mysql database and uses the repeat region functionality to create a dynamic list from the query results returned.</s><s> so i am guessing that behind the scenes there may be a connection timeout or something like that when trying to get the data from mysql, but that is just a guess. 
i did not create a file called repeatregion.htm, so i am guessing this might be some kind of template that is used within dw for this functionality to work.</s><s> i have no idea where the javascript bit comes in, but again, this is not something that i set up. 
</s><s>not sure it that helps at all, but a solution to this frustrating problem would be good. 
ps.</s><s> i think that this problem only starts for me once i alter the fabricated php code for database binding and server behaviour.</s><s> as soon as i alter any of the code manually (adding some additional logic for example) then dw stops showing that i have bound recordsets and shows exclamation marks in the server behaviour section.</s><s> which makes sense, but might also be the reason that dw gets confused and hangs.

<subject>DW Fluid grid layout question, adding a second layout?</subject>
<post author="Deixis" timestamp="Mar 20, 2014 4:57 PM">
<s>beginner question: 
so i've built my index page in dw cc using the fluid grid layout feature. 
</s><s>my site construction consists of 
index.html page boilerplate.css layout.css style.css respond.min.js 
the index page uses all the basic template tags such as header, article, aside, h1-5, p, etc etc 
</s><s>the site is working great and works responsively as i would expect. 
</s><s>however, the problem is i want to add a second html page to the site which i want to have a different layout, css style and fluid grid.</s><s> the only consistent elements to the master index page will be the header and navigation menu. 
</s><s>since all the styles of the html index page are linked to the master css pages how do i go about adding a different responsive layout to the same site without the changes affecting the master page? 
</s><s>for example if i duplicate the index page and start changing the layout it affects the entire site, not what i want. 
</s><s>so i thought i would need to duplicate all the files and rename them to something like 
page_2.html layout_2.css style_2.css and the 'boilerplate.css' and 'respond.min.js' would not be duplicated and stay as they are. 
...</s><s>but not sure if thats best practice to duplicate all the files so is there another method i should be considering?</s><s> or am i on the right track?

<post author="Nancy%20O." timestamp="Mar 21, 2014 4:10 PM">
<s>it's really better to build one layout for your entire site.</s><s> you may decide not to use all the elements on every page, but your primary design scheme should take everything into consideration much the way bootstrap, skeleton and other rwd frameworks do. 
</s><s>if necessary, you can use embedded css for a few page specific style changes.</s><s> embedded css will trump your external style sheets.

1) the $10,000,000 question is "how do i taget image adjustments that only appiles to specific devices" (meaning i have some images that i placed using the "global media" in the css designer. the basic set layout is great i just need to adjust a few things with the images in the individual views).</s><s> now when i drag the handle bars on the images in lets say smartphone view for instantant it affects all the views.</s><s> so i've come to the conclusion (maybe wrongly) that these icons have no desige power other than to show you what things look like.</s><s> now i'm focus on exactly how to use the css designer and media queries because i believe ( i may be wrong let me know) it is here you target and adjust image sizing for the specific devices.

<subject>Testing Spry form on local server and redirecting to a 'thank you' page</subject>
<post author="SarahVictoria75" timestamp="Nov 9, 2013 3:46 AM">
<s>hello, 
</s><s>i'm building a site in dw cs6 using php and testing on my local server (mamp). 
</s><s>i'm wanting to create a simple contact form so people can submit a message which will then be sent to one email address (my first time doing this). 
</s><s>using tutorials and a bit of code from our hosting provider i've written the code below. 
</s><s>is there a way that i can now test that this works on my local server?</s><s> i also want to create a thank you page that people will be redirected to. 
</s><s>when i view the form in a browser, the css styling is working but i don't know if it works because when i roll over the submit button it doesn't seem active/change and when i click on it nothing happens - i just stay on the same page, rather than being directed to another page. 
</s><s>i'm not sure if i've gone about this the right way. 
i realise that i'll have to redirect the path for the 'thanks' and 'error' pages at the bottom to my local mamp htdocs folder, but i'm not given the option to browse for these files and just shown the 'bind to dynamic source' icon.

<s>the reason why nancy thinks you're using pearl to do your form processing is because of this line: 
<form method="post" action="http://www.our_domain.co.uk/cgi-bin/formmail.pl" accept-charset="iso-8859-1" onsubmit="var originalcharset = document.charset; document.charset = 'iso-8859-1'; window.onbeforeunload = function () {document.charset=originalcharset;};"> 
</s><s>specifically, what you are doing is that when someone presses the "submit" button, the result is to call a file called formmail.pl and any filename with the .pl extension is perl. 
a file that uses php will end in .php. 
</s><s>if you are using mamp (or wamp) one issue you may have is that you have not installed a php mail handler.</s><s> on a regular web server, there is usually an email sending application that runs in the background on that server.</s><s> mamp and wamp may not include that.</s><s> they also may not include php or perl, either. 
</s><s>here is the start of the form that calls a php file to send email from one of my websites: 
<form method="post" action="sendmail.php"> 
</s><s>now, here, you're seeing that i am calling a php forms processor called sendmail.php.</s><s> that processor does all of my heavy lifting. 
</s><s>you can see the entire form here (and it's pretty basic):
