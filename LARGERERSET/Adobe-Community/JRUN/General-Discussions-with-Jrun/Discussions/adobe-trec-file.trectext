<s>i have installed jrun4 on windows server 2007 (64-bit).</s><s> it starts, and when you go to the jrun share, you can load and use the website.</s><s> so it appears as thought jrun is working correctly. 
</s><s>however, when i try to tie it in to iis, the tool shows "none" as the only option in the "iis web site" field of web server properties (as seen below).</s><s> in the past, the options were "all" or the specific websites.

<s>none of the above worked for me. 
</s><s>appreciate that that cf9 is old hat, but software doesn't suddenly stop being used just because the next version is out.
