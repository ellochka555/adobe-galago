2- if currently there is no easy way to export to dreamweaver, how do you use the "<>" button that gives you the css and put it in dreamweaver for it to work?

<s>so what would you recommend for a situation where i already have a site with a lot of code (php & js) in dw and a layout in place (meaning in production), but would like to switch layouts with ones created in reflow? 
i like what i see in reflow, but i don't know enough about how easy its result would integrate in a site that's already developed. 
</s><s>what can i expect from rf if i try implement its result into a php/js site?</s><s> here's what i would be looking for: 
i would definitely need the div hierarchy and the dom to stay the same.</s><s> i have js & jquery on the page and changing the hierarchy in the dom would wreak chaos.</s><s> is the generated js flexible enough to tweak so it doesn't butt-heads with my existing js my site has php content which i test locally on xampp...</s><s> the tutorials i've seen are all geared towards static html pages and there doesn't seem to be anything that helps integration with dynamic content when designing. 
</s><s>to clarify point 3...</s><s> imagine that i create a template in reflow and then work it in my own site (php). 
</s><s>now imagine i need to tweak stuff and make changes.</s><s> what is the workflow for that?</s><s> export again and start the whole thing over? 
</s><s>usually implementation and development of site requires a lot of back and forth.</s><s> i see that with the photoshop - reflow this is easy.</s><s> i'm not sure i understand a reflow - dreamweaver workflow.

<s>we got around this by adding additional columns and treating them as outside the main content columns.</s><s> much like golden grid does: http://goldengridsystem.com

<s>yeah, the grid in reflow is really just a visual and snap aid, it doesn't have any implications except for the min/max width in relation to the breakpoints.</s><s> we use a lot of full width background images which don't really snap to the area outside the grid unless they're set to body, but want full page or at least much wider than half a gutter (via show outer gutter) content images and bgs. 
</s><s>so it really depends on the min col grid you need and the hard 16 col limit is an issue for a grid that that has a higher common multiple for it's column variations.</s><s> i.e.</s><s> a 5 and 3 column design would need 15 for the content and 2 for the outside margin but that's over the limit. 
</s><s>for simplicity's sake we've moved to mostly 2-4 column designs which we can make work with a max 12+2 cols, but you have to figure out multiples that work out cleanly while maintaining a natural looking relationship of content to margins. 
</s><s>for that reason, and because of the platform on which we build most projects (nationbuilder) requiring a sidebar, we've gone heavily to 3,2,1 col layouts which we can break into just six layout cols. 
</s><s>but another workaround we're using is to flop the grid and gutters so that we have 7 gutters of 12% and 6 cols of 4%.</s><s> the grid is largely just a visual aid so it doesn't seem to have any implications so far.</s><s> the issue we were having was that the outside gutters are only half width which doesn't work for our designs which tend to have a lot of common match ups and lineups.</s><s> in that case you have the larger gutters which have a central snap guide as well which you may be able to repurpose to many more cols if you can come up with a clean grid is a lot of experimentation or a spreadsheet, the only way we were able to calculate all our variables into nice round numbers- 
the simplest fix though is probably a lifting of the arbitrary limit on number of columns.</s><s> i saw on another thread the devs were willing to consider that, they just needed a solid usecase to do so.</s><s> a grid that accounts for a design with both 4 and 5 columns in it would require at least 20 cols, and 2 extra on the outside would probably be pretty useful so a 24 col max should allow for almost all contingencies-

<s>i think everyone is getting their wired crossed.</s><s> i came accross this issue and used the same solution that liberalart used.</s><s> it's not great because you can only design up to a certain width.

<subject>I have now used Reflow for 2 client prototypes and here is what I have found.</subject>
<post author="TGMDigDir" timestamp="Feb 26, 2014 7:56 AM">
<s>first, i can see reflow being an incredible prototyping tool if adobe steps up and makes it a useful tool for production and not just another creative program to help designers build for the web.</s><s> that's what muse is for. 
</s><s>so here is my wish list. 
</s><s>reflow needs to be able to have more control over the dom elements.</s><s> by that i mean, we should be able to have a layer based approach (similar to what you can see in macaw) to move elements around from "box" to "box" (also, can't we just call them "divs").</s><s> nesting is crucial.</s><s> also, what's up with all the ids in the published files?</s><s> we should be able to name and create classes for these elements before it publishes.</s><s> also, support the basic html tags for users to control. 
</s><s>on that note, shared elements should have one style sheet instead of a style sheet for each page. 
</s><s>also, elements should be able to be saved to a library for use on multiple pages.</s><s> it is a nightmare now if you create an element on a page that needs to also be placed on other pages.</s><s> you have to recreate it on each page as of now. 
</s><s>support for common css frameworks would be an amazing idea...just sayin. 
</s><s>as for type...edge fonts and typekit are great but we all know that there are many other font libraries out there such as google fonts.</s><s> also, being able to use your own @font-face should be an option. 
i think the overall goal would be able to use the files produced as a starting point for production code.</s><s> as it stands right now, the code that is produced will require more time to format properly than it would be to build from scratch. 
i know reflow is not meant to be a dreamweaver or brackets, but it could really help set the stage for development in those programs.</s><s> it can improve the workflow of web development vs. just being a "cool new app".</s><s> it has real potential and i hope it gets the love that it deserves.

<s>mitch, 
</s><s>reflow could be the starting point for building a responsive design.</s><s> rather than handing off static comps to developers building a site or to customers reviewing your comps, you can show them a nearly fully functioning application in the browser.</s><s> you would do this by taking project_preview.html and hosting it on any server of your choice.</s><s> another alternative, if you are doing in person reviews is to just show it to people within reflow. 
</s><s>once designs are completed and you are ready to move to production, a front-end developer can view the css or html from your reflow project to get started.</s><s> or, they can start from scratch in whatever code editor of their choice.</s><s> so, this code editor could be dreamweaver, brackets, textmate, sublime...</s><s> etc.</s><s> 
</s><s>muse, on the otherhand is targetted for people who want to build websites and don't care about the code.</s><s> you can build a production website in muse, but, there will be limited functionality to make it fully responsive. 
</s><s>with all of these tools available, i can see how it can be truly confusing.</s><s> i believe reflow's strength is in providing a designer a new medium for creating their comps.</s><s> it is not a static ps or illustrator file anymore where they are designing a website and showing it to customers.</s><s> when their comps are static, much of the interactivity on how the site should work is lost.</s><s> reflow allows a designer to communicate their design intent better. 
</s><s>at the moment though, we don't provide the best transition after your design is created to get your site to production.</s><s> if you have an idea of what you would like to see, let us know.

in it's current preview incarnation reflow is intended purely as a design tool, essentially a means for realizing a responsive page design that is much more than the static comp you'd get out of say photoshop or similar tools.</s><s> the designs are fluid in nature and can be shared with potential clients as a preview of sorts in a fidelity equal to what they would get a final hand coded page (which clearly would take much longer than sketching out with reflow).</s><s> the designs in reflow are also gauranteed to be within the constraints of the web, as opposed to something produced with photoshop which may or may not be "realistic" as far as what's feasible in the real world, reason being of course is that you are designing within the browser itself. 
</s><s>so again, i stress, "in its current state", reflow is not intended as a production tool.</s><s> but of course, stay tuned.</s><s> many great things coming.

<s>if you go through the edge reflow marketing page at the very top of the page it states "design the responsive web" and a graphic below showing what would appear to be a web page design within the software.Ê it is a web page depiction because it specifically states "design the responsive web" above it emphasis on "web." Ê http://html.adobe.com/edge/reflow/ Ê Ê lets look at the paragraph titledÊ "web layout" Ê "design in reflow for the web.</s><s> move between design environments easily while maintaining your design fidelity.</s><s> reflow uses css and behaves like a browser, making it easier to translate your designs to the web.</s><s> gain the predictability of web layout, with the freedom of an adobe design tool." Ê this paragraph implies a fully functional design tool.Ê it uses css, makes it easier to translate your designs to the web.</s><s> the implication is you will have a working mockup you can further extend and develop outside the tool itself.</s><s> you may say, no!, no where does it say any of this.Ê it actually doesn't have to, the implication is there that it does and that is all that is needed the implication and what an average user would assume or understand the tool to be.Ê also note that no where on the page does it state it can't which also by intention or not, leads one to expect this to be a design tool for the web with capability of exporting the designs. Ê to further prove this point let me take you through other portions of this adobe edge reflow site and detail specifics in actual videos available on adobe tv detailing edge reflow and the newest version. Ê the very next section statesÊ "a native web surface provides the precise and intuitive controls you need to turn your vision into reality.</s><s> use reflow and the latest css specifications, including css regions and css filters, to create powerful responsive designs" Ê this further leads to the implication and assumptions that edge reflow will allow for full work flow that will lead to a design process that will produce a final output for the web.</s><s> indication that it exports the css and html.</s><s> it does not specifically state in words this but the implication is reinforced from earlier content in the page. Ê further down you seeÊ "preview and share your designs in your browser or on a device " under "previewing and sharing.</s><s> i want to bring your attention the statement "in your browser", no where does it specifically state google's chrome browser.Ê i use firefox and rarely ie, i never use chrome so when it states "in my borwser" i assume it works in any browser because that is the implication.</s><s> this is also misleading, it isn't any browser as it leads you to believe it is only the chrome browser which you have to specifically download and install if you don't already have it, i didn't.Ê another misleading statement. Ê at the bottom of the page there are testimonials about edge reflow apparently from real world companies and the imdication is that they use edge reflow to create their web projects from start to end.</s><s> this can't be true due to the nature of edge reflow but they do add to the over all impression that edge reflow is indeed a complete design tool to create real world web pages.</s><s> they give authority to this false impression but seals the deal for anyone that wants to use this in a production environment.</s><s> the testimonials are evidence that edge reflow is a production environment tool. Ê Ê now, jump over to the faq section and the very first paragraph specifically statesÊ "extract css code you can hand off to developers." Ê this would be an exact match for "what does the reflow website claim that seems to suggest it generates css and html?" Ê now lets further look at more misleading statements on the edge reflow website, specifically focusing on the faq section.</s><s> "who should use edge reflow?</s><s> edge reflow is ideal for web designers who want to create responsive layouts and css visuals targeting the latest browsers" Ê no, it actually can't.Ê it only is able to be displayed in the chrome browser directly from edge reflow and if you manually copy the css and html that is generated and look at it in any other browser there are lots of errors and funky things happen. Ê "built on webkit, edge reflow offers 1-to-1 web rendering capabilities for design within the constraints of browsers." Ê webkit is only certain browsers, ie for instance does not use it.Ê again, misleading statement. Ê Ê "css extraction capabilities offer a direct workflow between designers and developers.</s><s> " Ê again an exact statement that not just implies but makes a specific claim that the css and therefore the html can be exported. Ê Ê this is more of a nit pick but the following section actually doesn't make sense. Ê "what are shiny web features?</s><s> we love beautiful designs here at adobe and strive to continue to move the web forward.</s><s> as new css standards become available, we'll do our best to support them in our tools as soon as possible." this doesn't actually answer the question and the question itselfÊ doesn't really make sense.</s><s> i understand what was meant to be there but what actually is, makes no sense.Ê it makes me think this is created by support staff from india because most of my experience with adobe support doesn't make a whole lot of sense either. Ê Ê Ê in the sectionÊ "how is edge reflow different from adobe muse cc or dreamweaver cc?"Ê the following statement is made.</s><s> "while edge reflow creates html during the design process, the tool is focused on enabling designers to share their responsive design intent and for css to be extracted for use either by the designer or a developer as part of the website production process." Ê this can be read different ways but looking at it from an average user it does imply exporting of html and css is possible and inherent in the software. Ê through out the website it emphasises sharing amoung web designers.Ê the thing that isn't said is that everyone must also have edge reflow, the assumption of whoever wrote text for this site is that edge reflow is being used.Ê this would be a false assumption and the average web designer or developer reading through this site would not make that connection. Ê now to further point out specifics this last one is the final nail in the coffin of whether the website implies or otherwise states that the html and\or css can be exported from the program. Ê "what's the basic workflow in edge reflow?" Ê "...</s><s>once the different comps are ready, you can preview them in the browser or on devices via edge inspect before extracting the css code for use in development." Ê focus on " before extracting the css code for use in development." Ê Ê let's switch to two video's available and linked to from the edge reflow website and accessable other ways besides coming to the edge reflow site.</s><s> yes someone could never come to the edge reflow site and still get the impression that the software can indeed export html and css for production websites. Ê i want to also note that you never have to actually go the edge reflow site to actually download and install the software so there are probably people that never even see the website. Ê the overview of reflow video http://tv.adobe.com/watch/adobe-edge-reflow/overview-of-reflow/ Ê uses terms that make it seem to be a full fledge production design tool.Ê no where is it mentioned or text provided on the video page that it can't export html or css but the terms used in context of describing the capabilities make it seem it would.Ê though it never states one way or the other which is the problem and would lead an average web designer to conclude it would be possible in light ofÊ describing the use of media query which is a css specific thing and the capability of viewing the design in an external device, specifically a phone. Ê why would these things be possible if it weren't actually able to create production level code.Ê this is the impression the video gives and that is all that matters. Ê Ê the next video what's new in adobe edge reflow cc preview 7 states the following http://tv.adobe.com/watch/adobe-edge-reflow/whats-new-in-adobe-edge-re flow-cc-preview-7/ Ê "it works in the browser it works in a device" Ê futher statements talk specifically about "the dom" and other html and css specific language that in context makes it seem this is a production level tool. Ê the overall website for adobe edge reflow does give the impression this is a production level tool which exports css and html.</s><s> there are specific statements that lead to this false assumtion and specific statements that down right state that it can. Ê in any video i have seen talking about or demonstrating any aspect of adobe edge reflow it is being talked about as a production level tool that helps designers create and share designs as well as help create production websites.Ê the testimonials at the bottom of the adobe edge reflow website also lead to this false assumption. Ê now let's read what the ftc, federal trade commission has to say about false and misleading marketing.</s><s> the example in this blog post is talking about nissan trucks but the focus is more on the over all impression the marketing give for the capabilities of the product.</s><s> what really is interesting is how the ftc is focusing also on the types of media being used like phone cameras and what the overall impression of the actors / participants in these video's are doing to spur on the view that the product has the capability being advertised.</s><s> which in this case, the nissan truck, can't do. Ê the indication in the adobe produced videos for the adobe edge reflow also gives impressions that the tool can be used for something it can't.Ê even though adobe employees and staff state this is a tool for designing mockups the video's and tutorials i have seen give the impression it can also be used to mockup production level sites and some have actually stated this on camera.Ê i don't have the time to link and point out every statement specifically the above should be enough to reasonably describe how an average web designer would come to false conclusions about the capability of the software.Ê if you still don't see that, i don't know, your brain must work different than mine. Ê Ê ftc blog post about nissan trucks which in an overall similarity can be applied to the marketing of adobe edge reflow. http://business.ftc.gov/blog/2014/01/less-meets-eye Ê Ê Ê now go back to the faq page on the adobe edge reflow website and scroll down ? of the way to the bottom and hidden among the sections is a statement that specifically tells that exporting of html is not possible. Ê first one would actually have to go to the website, notice there are different sections like overview, features, faq etc... then specifically go to the faw page and read all the way down to where it states this.Ê it is not said, stated or made known anywhere other than in that section of the faq which not many people would ever see or read. Ê the ftc in their business section under legal documentation and what is required and also in their web advertising section makes it very clear that you can not hide statements that the users of your website need to know.</s><s> specifically about privacy, marketing assoctiations like being an affiliate to an advertiser whom you review or promote the products and also about locations of links and where and how often they have to be displayed.</s><s> the state of california also has several similar if not more intrusive regulation about these things. Ê how that would fall into play here is the hiding, which it can be viewed in this way the statement about exporting not being possible towards the bottom of the faq.</s><s> especially when other statements above this state it is possible and the over all impression given from the website this is possible. Ê to fix this just state at the top of the website and on other sections of the adobe infrastructure when talking or displaying anything about adobe edge reflow that it at this time can not export html or css.Ê that would prevent most people from wasting their time with it and save people like those participating in this thread to countless hours or days of learning a tool that can't actually be used in production. Ê you know what is interesting to me, the actual intention to never make this product have that capability.</s><s> it took many many complaints for the adobe designers to realize this actually is not a useful tool to anyone but less than 1% of designers out there.

<s>that was in reply toÊ "what does the reflow website claim that seems to suggest it generates css and html?" Ê those are very specific things about the website itself and the overall impression being given about reflow. Ê the other things you mention don't really have anything to do with the website or promotions but it does seem when talking to specific individuals actually on the team creating reflow there are conradictions between website and features. Ê i stopped using reflow because the code that is generated is not really cross browser, there is or was no code specific to mozilla or ie in the css.</s><s> compare the css generated by reflow and the code generated by muse and there are huge gaps, or were, between the two css.Ê Ê if you look at the overall product, reflow, why as the designers of this tool would you not automatically come to the conclusion people wouldn't actually want to have a exported version of what they see in the tool to use in production websites?</s><s> yeah it probably seems a bit harsh and maybe less pro adobe some of the things i state in my post but it is just my personal experiences that make me feel certain ways.Ê there actually have been less access to developers themselves at adobe then what you may believe. Ê edge reflow itself if it exported production quality cross browser code i would switch to it as a development tool and stop using most of the other tools i use currently.</s><s> it has great potential and the features that are being added seem great except with the caveat of not actually being about to use it in production.Ê nice show and tell software but when the client says that is great upload it and get it working, you have to step back and say no this is just show and tell to see what you like we actually have to go develop this in something else now that you approve.Ê good luck with that.ÊÊ everyone is different i guess but most of the vocal people i see think more the way i do than see this as a show and tell software.</s><s> i uninstalled it and stopped trying to learn more how to use it due to that. Ê i would think that focusing on exporting production quality cross browser code would be more a priority than what seems to be.Ê i am glad it is being developed, i understand it is a prerelease software and not even beta really but adobe sure is promoting the heck out of it as a development tool which as you say isn't quite there yet and the code should not be used in production.Ê adobe is promoting like it is production ready though, contradictions all over on that. Ê if i still used the software i would gladly contact you one on one to share my experience and give you bug reports and suggestions but since it can't output code for production i just don't use it.Ê instead i use muse, edge animate and hand coding when i need to.ÊÊ i seem to be switching more to tools like muse now, before i hand coded mostly but try to hand code edge animate animations and you will go insane so switching to the wyswyg visual editors now more. Ê thanks for letting me input even though it may not be what you wanted to hear and may allow you to clarify in other places besides the forums about your products. Ê thanks.

a few quotes from the reflow website: <quote>
<s>start responsive designs faster and create high-fidelity prototypes 
reflow uses css and behaves like a browser, making it easier to translate your designs to the web. 
</s><s>easily extract css from your project for further development in edge code cc, dreamweaver cc, or another code editor of your choice.

i did actually post a link to a resource i used to help with reflow export.</s><s> it's really not that complicated.</s><s> and with all of your authorship experience i'm sure you know in development no holy grail exists.</s><s> everything is a tool that either is used in the pipeline, or isn't.</s><s> in the case of reflow i have used it in a few lightweight projects (small static designs of 5-6 pages).

<s>i'm sorry to disagree.</s><s> but i feel this thread has just been people complaining.</s><s> there is an excellent thread elsewhere here requesting proper html/css export maybe providing details on what you'd like to see in the export, the controls you'd like to have, etc. would be much more productive than the big rants i've seen here.</s><s> i applaud adobe for handling it all with grace. 
</s><s>as a side note.</s><s> reflow will not be this magic solution.</s><s> (just as macaw won't be) the design community is so excited about these tools, but in a real development workflow they are quite limited.</s><s> because anything beyond a few web pages is just not going to benefit from these tools until they integrate frameworks, less, scss, etc. not to mention once you try integrating the designs with a cms, or custom web app...don't plan on ever going back, since editing the project design will require using the static files.</s><s> this is not exactly the most efficient workflow.</s><s> at least for the next few years i envision that these tools will work great for interactive prototypes, and simple designs...but i would currently not expect more than that from them.</s><s> i use bootstrap, foundation, custom grid frameworks, less, sass, etc on a daily basis, and the place of reflow is confined to the very early stages at the moment...but even then i usually just generate the image files from ps...and then handcode the prototypes in bootstrap/*insert another framework*, because in the end i'll have to convert the css to a less/scss which is just extra work.

<s>i concur with the general frustration, time spent (and wasted), and misunderstanding the reflow was something other than it is.</s><s> and all of this could have - should have - been avoided by one simple addition to the team's staff: a marketing authority who could consume every bit of *preview*, be it video, documentation, marketing piece, etc. and then determine whether the facts matched the message.

</s><s>so while you can easily find dozens of places adobe's docs state edge is a preview of a prototyping tool that does not mean you have no worries of people misinterpreting the app's purpose.

<s>my personal opinion, given all the feedback on this particular thread and what i now know about the product, is to get the code it does generate a bit more useable/production ready.</s><s> i think working on getting the css truly cross-browser compatible (i presume it's not based on feedback here.</s><s> i haven't tried it.</s><s>) and the html code cleaned-up so that it can be copied without too much post-reflow-manipulation would be a great next release.</s><s> i think that would make the app fit into more pipelines sooner than later and prevent people from having to start from scratch in another program jsut to try and reproduce what this already does in reflow/chrome. 
i have to agree that at this stage it really doesn't make sense to use it if i can' take work already done here and port it over easily to another app to add the non-responsive specific features.</s><s> all it serves at this point is to provide the feedback to you guys that other users have already given i think.</s><s> i too was under the impression based on the website and marketing material that it would generate usable production code for me at the end of the day even if it is just a preview app (whatever that means).</s><s> i also went through all of the tutorials to learn how to use it only to be slightly dissapointed for a while, but it looks like you guys are working towards making it a truly productive responsive design toolin the future...hopfully near future. 
i hope the end result is an end-to-end solution for responsive designs.</s><s> a plus would be including the ability to handle dynamic data or some back and forth compatibility between muse/dreamweaver/edge code/visual studio/other tools much like premiere/after effects/speed grade work today, with a non-destructive approach so that going back to reflow doesn't overwrite work done in the other tools.</s><s> if all it did ever was help manage the (production-ready) css, html to make it responsive and pass the generated code off to another app, i'd be happy to use it as my primary design tool. 
</s><s>overall, i think it's a great idea for a visual tool for designing repsonsive sites and hope it ends up becoming the product many of us probably thought it was to begin with.

<s>every package still seems to be focused on their specific target.</s><s> i'd say it's just your perspective on the apps where you get that conclusion.</s><s> illustrator is often used in design (web, and ui), because of how it can output resolution independent graphics easily for the specific target (retina vs non-retina output easily).</s><s> that is why it's used for web layout sometimes.</s><s> photoshop has all the editing capabilities a designer could want.</s><s> the path adobe has is perfectly fine in my book.</s><s> they realize pushing pixels (or vectors) around to build a design is much more flexible and non-restrictive than pushing grids around.</s><s> a new application would basically do the same thing.</s><s> then we can push our design into reflow, and that works beautifully.</s><s> and reflow is not a deadend.</s><s> i suppose i need to record a tutorial.</s><s> i just thought the video was pretty descriptive, and my video would basically be a replica of that one.

<s>hello, eprz,Ê when do you see this message?</s><s> do you see it after edge reflow cc has installed from the cc manager and you open reflow?</s><s> do you see this message in photoshop?ÊÊÊ edge reflow should install correctly regardless of what version of photoshop or generator you have.</s><s> however, it might be incompatible if you have an unreleased newer version of photoshop that you received from a place like a beta or prerelease program.Ê here is what happens in the reflow installer:Ê Ê 1.</s><s> if you install reflow with no photoshop, reflow installs, but, the reflow-ps plugin does not.</s><s> 2. if you install reflow with a version of photoshop under 14.1, reflow will install, but, the reflow-ps plugin does not.</s><s> 3. if you install reflow with version 14.1 of photoshop (or higher), reflow will install along with the reflow-ps plugin that works with generator.</s><s> the reflow plugin will be located in the "plug-ins/generator" folder of your photoshop installation.Ê Ê thanks, joan

<s>first of all, i am very excited about the possibility of using edge as an intuitive core production workflow tool for creating in-browser comps quickly. 
</s><s>the addition of font control is revolutionary for us ui designers.</s><s> i was able to enable the typekit font in photoshop cc and add the typekit kit id to reflow and it worked like a charm.

</s><s>couple of things i observed in my short time working with the program: 
1.</s><s> need to be able to "control click" and edit the individual page names.</s><s> currently it appears i can only select and create new pages.</s><s> 2. tighter integration with dreamweaver.</s><s> you've established an excellent start with allowing reflow to sync with photoshop, why not take it all the way to production?</s><s> would be nice to update code and view synchronized results in either program.</s><s> currently the files load differently in dreamweaver edit mode (so that may require a dw update that needs to occur) 3.</s><s> i'm a ui designer with interim coding skills.</s><s> i can usually tweak the code to get what i want but still need a wysiwyg solution to get started in the right direction.</s><s> i've used jetstrap for building bootstrap sites but reflow gives more control.</s><s> please continue making reflow the robust solution to help us all adapt to the responsive web.

<s>so without a little more detail, it's hard to know if you want the image as the background of a div, or simple nested in a div.</s><s> i'll go over both. 
</s><s>inline images: with just standard inline images, it's pretty easy.</s><s> simply change the width to the size you want, whether in percentage, px or em.</s><s> then change the height to auto. 

</s><s>background images: these are a little harder to keep proportional, since it is the div that controls the dimensions.</s><s> the way i've found to do it is with two divs.</s><s> one will be the parent of the other.</s><s> the top parent controls the width, while the child uses that width as a basis to get the height. 
</s><s>parent div: width: whatever you like height: 0 position: relative 
child div: background: add the image background image width: 100% width: 100% padding-bottom: % of the image proportion (in my example it's 133.38%) 
</s><s>i've attached a project with a quick example.</s><s> changing the width of the parent will change the child.</s><s> i've also added a text object inside to show that as well.</s><s> i got this from szymon kownacki in this post on css.

<s>good question!</s><s> our intention, as of now, is for reflow to be for designers to create and share responsive designs.</s><s> because reflow's design surface is the webkit browser, and because reflow's designs are created in css and html, the designer can be confident that their design can translate to the web (as opposed to a pixel perfect design done solely in photoshop, for example, which may require significant adjustment to adapt the design to the web/browser). 
</s><s>exporting production code and allowing round-trip editing (such as editing the preview in dw or edge code then pulling it back into reflow) are areas that we've considered on the team, as well as heard several requests from users (such as your feedback on this thread).</s><s> we also recognize that this functionality would move the scope and direction of reflow from being focused on design and sharing that design to being more of a website creation tool.</s><s> that might be a reasonable direction to take reflow, but it may also dilute how effective reflow is at meeting the needs of the original target user.</s><s> that also opens up questions around the code reflow would create and how reflow would handle custom html/css/javascript/server code, etc that a user could introduce in edge code or other external tools. 
</s><s>getting feedback from users like yourself is why we did this early public preview - sounds like you would find reflow most valuable for your workflow if it allowed for round-trip editing.</s><s> can you explain more about your workflow?</s><s> what tools do you use?</s><s> do you work with other members of a team, such as another designer or developer?</s><s> or do you do the design and code all yourself?

am i missing something?</s><s> as reflow being a piece of software aimed at the web, it would be very useful to be able to add links directly in reflow. 
</s><s>best regards, sam

<s>right now reflow does not roundtrip anything.</s><s> the html file from reflow gets recreated each time you preview, so if you want to use it as a starting point, you should rename the file or save it somewhere else.</s><s> this does mean once you start production you need to keep better track of the changes you make in your desgin so you can carry them over to you copy that's ready for production.</s><s> you can also use the code export button in relfow to more quickly copy you css changes and paste them over in production.

<s>hi chris, could you give us an idea of how long do we have to wait for a reflow version which respects (and ignore) the thrid-parties modification in its html file?</s><s> i'm not just talking of simple links but: cms integrations, js/jquery, php functions and all the other infinite options.</s><s> respecting a "one way" workflow (exporting from reflow and never coming back) is not easy at all considering that design is most of the time a refinement process with the (never satisfied) client and the team.</s><s> being able to going back and forth from reflow, integrating it with ides and other tools, could really be a killer feature.

<s>thanks for your feedback.</s><s> we definitely believe design is an iteractive process.</s><s> the right solution might not be round triping html, especially as mix in all those technologies you have above (cms, js, php, etc..</s><s>).</s><s> the main reason is with all those combinations it's really hard to make everything look correct and edit the correct files.</s><s> in these cases, the best tool for production is probably dreamweaver with liveview and it's related files, so you the author can control the changes precisely. 
</s><s>for reflow, the solutions we're thinking about are more along the lines of versioning and tracking changes and allowing you to quickly see what is different between two points in a design.</s><s> then you the author can take just those changes and apply it in the correct spot for your setup.</s><s> we are definitely thinking about how to integrated these workflows so you can go efficiently and accurately between design and production, but it most likely won't be automatically like through round triping html.

<s>hi chris, your plan for reflow sounds good.</s><s> versioning is probably the most adaptable way to integrate it with the rest of the workflow.</s><s> what i think is still missing, on the simple side, is link creation and management inside reflow.</s><s> of course, considering you have just introduced multiple pages, this feature shouldn't be far... 
</s><s>about dreamweaver, i've been a faithful user for years but now it's definitely old for some uses.</s><s> just to say, if i open the responsive page i just created in reflow with dwcc in live view, something basic as background gradients are completely missing.</s><s> well, i'm not going to use it for this kind of work.</s><s> do you know for what dw is still a great tool?</s><s> email newsletters, since they still have to respect old standards that no one else uses anymore. 
</s><s>for all the rest i definitely prefer the editor/ide way: sublimetext and other tools.</s><s> they're faster, more apt to the task and, similarly to the adobe edge line of products, made with the same technologies they help to work with.</s><s> in the future, who knows...</s><s> maybe, you should put in development a "dreamweaver edge" version and drop the old one, a little clunky even if recently revarnished ;-)
