<s>hello!</s><s> im developing ipad game with air and wish to use scout for profiling.</s><s> unfortunately it is not working as advertised - i am using flash builder 4.7 with air sdk 3.4 on mac os 10.7.5 - i downloaded scout and gaming sdk and replaced air 3.4 sdk (bundled with fb4.7) with air 3.5, so i see "this project usinf air3.5" in project properties - i checked "use advanced telemetry" option in project compiler settings - i installed scout companion on ipad and successfully enabled scout - it correctly see scout on mac (updating new session options from it) - but when i'm building and running my program on ipad (or air simulator) scout shows new session with only basic telemetry. panels with actionscript/display list rendering just empty. of course in new session options i enabled everything exept stage 3d. - i tryed to: 1) uncheck "build with telemetry" option in compiler settings -> build and run -> scout started new session and shows "enable telemetry compiler options" lines in actions script/displayrendering panels.</s><s> 2) i checked "build with telemetry" again -> build and run -> scout started new session and no warnings about compiler in panels, but no info either

<subject>Need Help: Large Inactive Time Spikes occasionally?</subject>
<post author="eggsamurai" timestamp="Feb 21, 2014 2:11 AM">
<s>our developers, and also many users, report that our app occasionally freezes for one second.</s><s> this happens randomly but quite frequently.</s><s> since our app is a fast paced platformer game, the one second freeze often times results in an instant fail for our players, which is a big problem for us. 
i looked at frames where these freezes happen in adobe scout.</s><s> the inactive time is very high (more than 1000).</s><s> the cpu usage on these same frames, most of the time, is very low, and sometimes even 0, so the inactive time spike does not seem be related to cpu usage.</s><s> (i used scout on a release version of the swf). 
</s><s>all of our games are built with starling, and all of them experience this same issue.</s><s> this issue has been observed on both windows 8 and windows 7, and in several different browsers (chrome, firefox, ie).

<s>hi jason, 
</s><s>thanks for sharing your experience - my comment was referring to skipper7333's problem, and the attached screenshot; clearly your problem is something completely different. 
i agree that this bug ought to be fixed.</s><s> on the scout side, we've tried our best to categorise everything that takes a significant time, i.e. to keep the "other overhead" category as small as possible - it looks like this is a case where we could use an additional metric in flash player, to measure this activity! 
</s><s>in the meantime, since the problem is only with async file opens, you might want to try using a worker thread to do a sync file open - even if it's a bit of an ugly solution, this should fix the problem without impacting your ui.

<s>thanks for the feedback!</s><s> we'd definitely like to reduce the amount of time in "runtime overhead", and we'll hopefully be adding new data in future versions of flash player/scout that'll better let you see what's going on.</s><s> in the case of windows 8, it's quite likely that there are costly code paths that we haven't instrumented, since this is a new target for flash player. 
</s><s>bear in mind that there is some finer-grained data in the "other overhead" category - if you look in the top activities and activity sequence panels, you can see a more detailed breakdown of what's going on.</s><s> but "runtime overhead" is just a catch-all activity for anything we're not explicitly measuring, so if your problem is there, it means we need to improve the instrumentation.</s><s> if you have any specific content you're able to share, that illustrates this, it would be helpful if you could send it to us!</s><s> (you can contact me at michsmit@adobe.com). 
</s><s>as an aside, remember when you're profiling performance to start by turning off all the settings for new sessions except for basic telemetry.</s><s> some of these settings have high overhead, especially on mobile, and this could be giving you misleading results (we don't currently categorise telemetry overhead, so this would appear under generic "runtime overhead").

<s>hello thibault, thanks very much for the quick response! 
</s><s>so if i'm understanding correctly, there's a free trial period for creative cloud, and for now, scout can be obtained as part of this free trial, but when the model changes, it will not be available through the creative cloud free trial period and will only "kick in" when a membership is fully paid?
