<s>both me and a colleague have the same issue.</s><s> both purchased at surfspot.   it's blatantly obvious that it's a problem on adobe's side.</s><s> a malicious mind would even consider thinking that it's adobe's charming way to get us to use cc instead of cs6.   having such a mind i did think that.   it could also have something to do with the hack that took place a while back (which would explain the need for a proof of purchase).</s><s> i'm pretty sure that adobe isn't in a hurry to admit to either of those scenario's.   conspiracy theories aside, let's see what happens with the people that have contacted support.   edit: surfspot has just replied to a tweet complaining about this issue with "we're investigating, we'll get back to you asap" (paraphrasing)   message was edited by: walterg - update from surfspot

<s>dit is slechts gedeeltelijk waar: ik heb een medewerkerslicentie aangeschaft bij surfspot in 2012.</s><s> de licentie toen was anders dan bij de cs6 die nu via surfspot verkrijgbaar is.</s><s> surfspot heeft reeds aangegeven dat de informatie die de gebruikers destijds kregen fout was: de licentie was slechts permanent tot de eindduur van de overeenkomst tussen de universiteiten en adobe, en dat is 1 juni 2014.</s><s> mijn licentie had moeten blijven werken tot 1 juni 2014.</s><s> ik heb nu van surfspot een nieuwe licentie voor een jaar gekregen ter compensatie van de fout.</s><s> (met dank aan zita van de klantenservice.</s><s>) niet permanent, maar gegeven de prijs die we bij surfspot betalen zeker niet iets om hard over te klagen. 
</s><s>and now for the foreigners: surfspot sold permanent licenses for cs6 in the period july 2012 to july 2013.</s><s> this was partially in error: the license should have been permanent only until the end of the contract between the universities and adobe which is june 1, 2014.</s><s> my license should have continued working until june 1, 2014.</s><s> surfspot has given me a new license which is valid for a year, to compensate for the error.</s><s> it's not permanent but at the price we pay surfspot not something to complain hard about. 
</s><s>so the matter has been clarified: adobe made an error by expiring these licenses before june 1, 2014 and surfspot made an error by not stating the licenses were not permanent but only until june 1, 2014.</s><s> new licenses, bought after july 2013 are valid for only one year. 
</s><s>note that my cs6 did not stop working after 12 months (which would be if the license was for a year without telling us that) but stopped working after 17 months. 
</s><s>the fact that adobe made an error is of course illustrated by non-surfspot customers also suffering from the premature expiration.</s><s> (but i saw only one such complaint here so it must not be that widespread.</s><s>)
