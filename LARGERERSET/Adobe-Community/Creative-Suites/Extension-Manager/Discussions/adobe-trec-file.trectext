<s>hello guys, adobe extension manager cannot be used for installing extensions on photoshop.</s><s> the problem is nobody can understand how to install the extension.</s><s> use case: 
1) user installs photoshop 2) downloads .zxp file 3) clicks on .zxp file - the dialog .zxp is invalid extension is displayed doesn't matter if it's mac or win.</s><s> for example when user downloads .exe or .dmg file it starts to install right away! 
</s><s>do i need to make my own user-friendly zxp-extension installer?</s><s> how to do it?</s><s>

<s>carl, 
</s><s>it's not a problem of particular extension.</s><s> it's not a problem of just my extension - it's like that with any extension!</s><s> you can take any of them! 
</s><s>here are the screenshots of what typical users get when they download an extension right after installing photoshop from scratch on a clean os.</s><s> do you see how it works?</s><s> they don't have any clues on what to do with their .zxp files.

<s>it seems that you didn't install extension manager cc so the os can't find the file type association for .zxp.</s><s> in cs6 and earlier, extension manager will be installed along with cs products such as photoshop. but in cc, extension manager cc becomes a standalone product and you have to install it separately.</s><s> after installing extension manager cc you will be able to install extensions by double clicking them.

<s>yes, carl 
</s><s>that's why i tell you that extension manager cc is absolutely useless if the user doesn't at least know that it's needed for the successful installation. 
</s><s>can you provide the other more intuitive way of installing extensions from site so user knows how to do it?</s><s> some command line tool?</s><s> anything that the end user can do with a double-click?

<s>i second that.. whoever made this decision on excluding extension manager from default installation is disconnected from the world of software... when a software is downloaded from anywhere it should be installed with one click.. period. 
adobe manager cc should be included in the default installation or it's dead
