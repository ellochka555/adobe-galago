<s>the variable displayed on the certificate is just pulling whatever is available from the server.</s><s> if the server sends the user as surname/firstname then that's what you'll see.</s><s> it doesn't break them up in to separate variables for you to change the order.

<s>i am not sure if this is closer to what you are wanting or not, but i offerit just in case it is.</s><s> i needed to create software training for our teachers that would be using collaborate, but frustratingly at the time they always came out with new versions in the middle of summer training.</s><s> we just couldn't wait to start training after the new version came out.</s><s> what i ended up doing was using image pieces and parts of the interface that i used to make the interface of the software.</s><s> i was able to create the training to get our staff started but then it was easy to just change impacted ui pieces and add a few new slides in for new features when the new version came out to continue using nearly the same training for the rest of the summer.</s><s> from version 11 to 12 for instance, only 1 small ui element changed.</s><s> the updating took me a mere 15 minutes compared to having to make a whole new training because that one tiny ui element was different.</s><s> this has a large up front time investment, but is saves time in the long run when software is updated.

<s>there are two types of actions in captivate.</s><s> the standard actions listed in the popreties panel will release the playhead on success. 
</s><s>what you are wanting in this instance is the other type of action: advanced action.</s><s> these do not release the playhead (unless you want it to) and it is the way to get an interaction to do more than one thing from that single click.</s><s> these are easy to jump in to as well, so don't worry about the word advanced in the name. 
</s><s>go to project in the top menu bar along the top and select "advanced actions ..." 
</s><s>all this one will need is a type called standard action and that is what the panel will default to, so you are set to give your action a name.</s><s> you will enter it into the "action name" field.</s><s> there are a few finicky rules about naming your actions such as not starting out with a number as the first character and no spaces (you can use underscore though), but let's just get you started with a name goto_url_1. 
</s><s>double-click in the second column of the table.</s><s> it should open up a drop down with the same options that you normally see in the actions section of the properties panel.</s><s> just as in that drop down you have used before, select "open url or file".</s><s> you will be prompted to put the url in and decide what sort of window you want it to open in just as upi had when you did it as a standard action. 
</s><s>save your action by clicking on the "save as action" button in the bottom right of that window and then close it. 
</s><s>now, back in your porject view you can click on your button and this time from tha actions section in the properties panel select advanced action and look for the action you just created.</s><s> slect it and you are ready to test it out. 
i always like to give ideas on ways you can take the next step.</s><s> if you feel up to it, try this.</s><s> go back in to your advanced action panel and click the drop down for the existing actions and select your advanced action that you made a bit ago.</s><s> double click in the second column but the next row down from your jump to url command.</s><s> locate "play audio".</s><s> if you don't have any audio in the audio library yet, click on "import" and bring in an mp3 or wav audio file from your hard drive or from the varies sound effects that you can find in your captivate/gallery/sound folder.</s><s> captivate comes with about 30 sound effects for you that you can bring in to your project.</s><s> once you pick one, click ok.</s><s> then save the update to your action and close the advanced action window.</s><s> now try it out.</s><s> not only will the url open up and the playhead stay where it is supposed to, but you now have a sound too. 
</s><s>advanced actions are like having a bag of cookies or potato chips.</s><s> once you realize that you can make more than one thing happen from a single event and hold that timeline still you will keep reaching your hand in for more and more.</s><s> you can make some pretty complex custom interactions and serious (not arcade) games.</s><s> i had a subject area adventure game in my mind from before i ever even bought captivate.</s><s> that desire to be able to build it really provided incentive to start digging in to advanced actions and i have had such a good time seeing what can be done with them.</s><s> i am totally hooked!</s><s> every day i cannot wait to dig in to my captivate projects.</s><s> i bet you will love it too.

<s>thanks, lilibiri.</s><s> for the life of my i couldn't remember the third term used for those.</s><s> i kept remembering the conditional and standard, but simple was just not coming up in my mind.</s><s> liliberi has great tutorials and articles.</s><s> it is well worth digging in at her site to learn a ton about captivate. 
</s><s>if in addition to the video and article liliberi gave, you would like to see a captivate file that has a click to open a url/file in it that is pausing properly i posted one for you on our server.</s><s> i hope that by seeing a captivate file you may spot the key difference in setup that you need for your project.</s><s> in our project, our graphics on that start page vary a bit from lesson to lesson, so i use a click box instead of a button for the url.</s><s> it makes it faster to set up different graphics for that start page vs updating an image button.</s><s> if a button keeps giving you trouble, perhaps trying a clickbox over a graphic, text, or smartshape could accomplish what you need. 
</s><s>you can try out the interaction at http://www.virtualhomeschoolgroup.com/file.php/1/temporary_troubleshoo ting_files/slides_pause_after_url_button_clicked/w_clickbox_for_url/pu blished/multiscreen.html see if the the first page properly pauses for you as it does for me.</s><s> if it doesn't, then perhaps it is a specific browser that is 'disobeying' the pause. 
</s><s>you can download the captivate file to compare how i did it with what you are doing at http://www.virtualhomeschoolgroup.com/file.php/1/temporary_troubleshoo ting_files/slides_pause_after_url_button_clicked/w_clickbox_for_url/ca ptivate/slide_pause_after_url_click.cptx in the captivate file you can download, the note-taking and contact me graphics are the one that goes to a url. if you click on the note-taking click box and look in the actions/on success you will see it linking to the advanced action i named download_notes.</s><s> the open url or file command is there.</s><s> the next button has a pause at 3.5 seconds holding the playback until it is clicked.</s><s> you wil the original countdown that we would normally is there in the timeline a bit below the button.</s><s> if you want to explore the option of just giving the participant time via a countdown to get a file or open a url instead of a full pause until clicked, just take out the button and you will see it the way we usually do them.

<s>okay, so just tested with a ppt example used in class.</s><s> sure enough, when coming from ppt a click outside the smarty pants shape does result in the slide advancing.</s><s> personally, i think it's related to the ppt converting to a swf and that being the background.</s><s> but hey ho.</s><s>

<subject>Best Practises ?Repurposing videos with Captivate and export as SCORM</subject>
<post author="llaferte" timestamp="Mar 21, 2014 6:18 AM">
<s>i'm new to captivate and scorm.  i have a series of 6 basic video lessons (mp4s) which make-up one course.  lerners must complete (pass a summary quiz) each lesson before they can move on to the next.  we want to repurpose these files to create a more immersive ux.  i'm looking for a "best practices" suggestion for this work.   currently the plan looks like this: re-edit existing videos into sets of smaller clips.</s><s> create captivate project/s using the edited clips and adding other captivate tools/features e.g. navigation, quizzes etc. the captivate project/s will be exported/saved as scorm package/s.</s><s> we will up-load the scorm package/s to moodle.   i'm very new to this, i've not yet created a scorm-based moodle project, and am not clear on how they "work," but that's for the moodle forums.   should i create one large "course" with captivate that contains all of the content from all 6 mp4s?  this will require us to rely on captivate's functions to control access to each lesson.  each lesson has a summary quiz; learners must pass each quiz before they can move to the next lesson.  this one scorm package is than imported into one moodle course.   should i create six smaller "lessons" with captivate that contain only the content from one mp4?  this will require us to rely on captivate's functions to control progress through only one lesson.  the summary quiz will be 'administered' by captivate/scorm.  when the learner passes the summary quiz the lesson is complete.  we will rely on moodle's access control functionality to then provide access to the next scorm package.   if anyone has experience with this sort of project, or can offer some advise i would appreciate it.   thanks larry

<post author="armoorefam" timestamp="Mar 21, 2014 8:51 AM">
<s>while i cannot claim enough expertise to state these are best practices, i offer them as food for thought as you work out your implementation.</s><s> we use moodle and captivate in combination.</s><s> we do kindergarten to grade 12 curriculum and we realized that there is a huge number of lessons that can be repurposed for multiple grade levels and we also have more than one copy of many of our courses. 
</s><s>what we decided to do was to use what would be equivalent to a repository for the lessons portions.</s><s> these have interactives in them for practice of the new concept but they are not scored.</s><s> our many courses that use a particular lesson can then link to the one instance of the lesson from the repository.</s><s> this saves us a lot of disk space, development time in new course builds, and if we need to fix or update the lesson we merely have to do it once.</s><s> those are huge benefits. 
</s><s>anything that will score to the grade book runs inside a course so the scorms can 'talk' to the course the student is in, so homework, quizzes, and tests are housed inside moodle courses. 
</s><s>we can place links to the repository lessons easily into the scorm final landing pages of after the pretest or provide the ability to link to the lesson as feedback if a student is having trouble with a particular question. 
</s><s>we are also starting a project of building interactive walkthroughs for each problem that will be housed in the reporitory.</s><s> if students get stuck, they can be linked out to the walk through.</s><s> this is a great way to do these because their homework will not have to be weighted down with a walk through for every problem.</s><s> that will make them faster to load, but yet when they do need a walk through we can link them out from the scorm to the deep and interactive added support for just what they need. 
</s><s>so far, this setup has worked well for us. we are not expecting any major changes such as a new domain name on the repository.</s><s> if your repository domain name or server structure for your repository is likley to be in flux, then this setup is not ideal.

<s>the maxslide solution was because of the way captivate uses the lesson location and suspend data.</s><s> a user's progress is stored in the suspend data and their last location is stored in the cmi.location.</s><s> if you want the user to enter the course to their furthest point, not where they exited, this is where you would use the maxslide user variable.
