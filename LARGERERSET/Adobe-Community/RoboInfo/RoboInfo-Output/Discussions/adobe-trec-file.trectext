<s>i currently use fm 7.2 for my documentation.</s><s> i created an online help doc and now wish to convert it to an online help format.</s><s> i purchsed a product called robohelp for framemaker for this purpose but i am not happy with it.</s><s> now i find that the product is no longer supported so i can't get an help on it.</s><s> i was told to try roboinfo.</s><s> i downloaded the trial version but i am not sure i am using it correctly.</s><s> i imported my mif file and generated the help file with a manual template.</s><s> it looks terrible.</s><s> i see that i am provided with style tools to re-tool the whole darn thing, but that would take months.</s><s> the robohelp for framemaker product allows you to select a source doc and then compile and view, no reformatting is nesesary unless you choose to do that.</s><s> seems with roboinfo, you are required to reformat the entire document you used as a source.</s><s> do i have this right or am i missing a step here?</s><s> please explain to me how to best use roboinfo with framemaker as the source doc.</s><s> thank you for your time and consideration.</s><s> bill

<s>using roboinfo 5 engine - won't be upgrading.</s><s> nothing seems to really be working right any longer on the webpage display.</s><s> the index tab isn't regularly reliable but the search tab is never reliable.</s><s> returns no values usually and if and when it does, it is usually not related to the item search at all.</s><s> anyone know what i might check to determine why this is no longer working.</s><s> thanks

<s>we have a trouble shooting guide that we came up with for any problems we encounter with roboinfo.</s><s> when we had a problem with the search functionality we would ask our it support person to reboot the server.</s><s> if that doesn't work, check the troubleshooting tab on the configuation manager to determine where the error occured.</s><s> also, we sometimes have problems with new content not showing up in the table of contents, our it support person will clean up the reserved folder and restart the iis and indexing services on the server.</s><s> the only other choice if these don't work is to reinstall the software and republish all the projects.</s><s> hope this info helps you.

<s>each time i generate a layout, the default html file remains the same as when i originally created the project.</s><s> i have tried everything.</s><s> i created a new layout, specified a new output folder, set a new default page to initially open, to no avail.</s><s> yes, the default page opens for viewing, but the location of the file is still the original html file created when i originally named the project.</s><s> if my message doesn't make sense, let me try again.</s><s> when i view the output, it opens a page titled (say) file://c/roboinfo/project1.html.</s><s> i want it to change project1.html to project2.html.</s><s> yes, i can change which page is open for viewing, but the initial location that opens is still file://c/roboinfo/project1.html.</s><s> am i going to have to create an all-new project from scratch?

<subject>Topics get published though not in TOC</subject>
<post author="tcbdon" timestamp="Aug 1, 2006 12:11 PM">
<s>hello, we have noticed something unexpected with the publish feature.</s><s> while searching our live roboengine server, certain topics would come back as a match.</s><s> however, these same topics were not in the toc, nor were they in the project toc -- never had been.</s><s> these are just "under construction" documents, to be added to the toc later.</s><s> what rules does the publish facility follow that allows it to put files on the server that are not part of the project's toc?</s><s> thanks, don

<post author="tcbdon" timestamp="Oct 26, 2006 9:37 AM">
<s>in the lack of any other input i have surmised this.</s><s> the publish facility is simply a file transfer of all the files under a project folder.</s><s> this will include files that are not even in the project view, let alone a member of the toc.</s><s> also, publish does not remove files from the server had they once been put there but are no longer part of the project folder.</s><s> there is much manual clean up required on both the roboengine server and the author's personal project folder to remove unwanted files from being found in searches.</s><s> if these conclusions are not correct i'd appreciate some clearer guidance.</s><s> thanks, don

<subject>Publish updates not under review</subject>
<post author="UpNorth" timestamp="Jun 6, 2006 10:32 AM">
<s>any know if there is a way to publish only updates to your project that are not under review.</s><s> ie if i have already published my project and i have one person working on updating a few of the pages.</s><s> i would like to be able to publish all pages that are not currently under "ready for review" status.</s><s> that way a manager could go in review the document...change its status and republish to the web. ...make sense?
