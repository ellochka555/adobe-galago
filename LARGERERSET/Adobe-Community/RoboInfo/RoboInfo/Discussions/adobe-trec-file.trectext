<s>this all depends on how you have your cascading style sheets (.css) setup.</s><s> if, for instance, you have a heading in your word document formatted as heading 1 whatever formatting associated with it in word (bullet points, font size, font type, color, etc.</s><s>) will carry through to robo unless you apply a certain style sheet to it after you import it into robo.</s><s> style sheets in word are typically visible next to the font type in the standard toolbar.</s><s> if not present, they can be located under format > styles and formatting.</s><s> you can set up a style sheet that formats heading 1 (or whatever you choose to call it) a certain way, normal a certain way, etc., apply this style sheet to each of your procedures, and all of the formatting associated with that style sheet will present itself.</s><s> this saves tons of time as well as keeps everything consistent.</s><s> i hope this helps.</s><s> gary
