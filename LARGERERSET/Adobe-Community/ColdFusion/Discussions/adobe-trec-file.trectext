<subject>Problem with jquery .load and cfinclude</subject>
<post author="TlalocW2" timestamp="Mar 21, 2014 9:43 AM">
<s>another programmer has created a captcha file that's in a global directory so all we have do is call it with a cfinclude, however, he did not build any kind of refresh into it.</s><s> so i created a work-around thusly: 
<div id="captchadiv"><cfinclude template="/cfincludes/captcha.cfm"></div> <a id="refreshcaptcha" href="">refresh</a> 
</s><s>clicking the refresh link activates the following code: 
$(document).ready(function() { $.ajaxsetup ({ // disable caching of ajax responses cache: false }); 

$("#refreshcaptcha").click(function(e) { $("#captchadiv").load("/ajax/captchainclude.cfm?_="+math.round(math.random()*10000)); e.preventdefault(); }); }); 
since i can't reload a cfinclude directly in an ajax call, i call /ajax/capthcainclude.cfm, a local file in the website directory, that repeats the original cfinclude code that calls the global captcha 
<cfinclude template="/cfincludes/captcha.cfm"> 
</s><s>on loading the page the first time, the captcha will work fine if you put in the right code.</s><s> however, if you can't read it and have to reload it, it will not work.</s><s> in playing with it, i also loaded my local /ajax/captchainclude.cfm file via jquery and got rid of the cfinclude, and when i did that, it wouldn't work the first time either. 
</s><s>any ideas on what the problem is?</s><s> thanks for your help

<s>there's no client data or anything sensitive here, its simply a configuration screen.  and like i said, its a dev server on a private network - not public.   the cfcs are very simple, and do not have any includes.   so accessing them should not be calling fbx_settings.cfm or fbx_layouts.cfm.   it must be something in the way it passes the parameters.  if i pass the cfc url variables, it happily return the data correctly, without any includes (or errors)   for instance, this is broken: http://admin.absbook.cf10/todynamic/display/admin/sitecampuses.cfc?met hod=getebookpricingoptions&_cf_ajaxproxytoken=67e4609e9e8a7f998867&ret urnformat=json&argumentcollection=%7b%22ebookvendorid%22%3a%222%22%2c% 22selectedebookpricingid%22%3a%221%22%7d&_cf_nodebug=true&_cf_nocache= true&_cf_clientid=0e09335044a83c729fd95ae3ef8aa869&_cf_rc=0     this works as expected: http://admin.absbook.cf10/todynamic/display/admin/sitecampuses.cfc?met hod=getebookpricingoptions&ebookvendorid=2&selectedebookpricingid=1

<s>hopefully someone more versed in cfajaxproxy and cfgrid can chime in (i've never used either).</s><s> i generally try to avoid using coldfusion's built-in ui stuff because it is inherently limited (only the pieces of underlying libraries that they chose to implement are available) and way behind in versions (i think the cfgrid stuff is based on a really old version of extjs). 
i much prefer to use a modern javascript library for ui controls and use things like jquery to handle ajax - it's much simpler and you have more control that way.</s><s> there is a project on github that attempts to help people do ui without coldfusion's rather poor ui tags: https://github.com/cfjedimaster/coldfusion-ui-the-right-way, although there isn't an example yet for cfgrid (take a look at cftable though, as there's a link from there to the excellent datatables plugin for jquery).</s><s> another jquery alternative is the jqgrid plugin, and there are also grids in the extjs and dojo libraries.

</s></quote>i think i know.</s><s> the encoding is done by coldfusion internally.</s><s> there is definitely a bind to cfc.</s><s> might be from cfgrid, but not necessarily.</s><s> might also be from cfselect, as you yourself have pointed out, or from any tag that has bind as attribute: cfdiv, cfinput, and so on.</s><s> in fact, i have verified that the following are typical url variables that coldfusion automatically adds to the query-string when it does a bind: 
_cf_ajaxproxytoken returnformat argumentcollection _cf_nodebug _cf_nocache _cf_clientid _cf_rc 
if the bind is from a grid, then the argumentcollection structure will contain, in addition, the grid parameters, 
page pagesize gridsortcolumn gridsortdirection 
putting all this together, we can deduce from this thread that your application uses the following 2 binds: 
<cfselect bind="cfc:sitecampuses.getebookpricingoptions({ebookvendorid},{select edebookpricingid})"> 
<cfgrid bind="cfc:siteaddresses.getsiteaddresses({cfgridpage},{cfgridpagesize },{cfgridsortcolumn},{cfgridsortdirection}, siteid=5)"> 
</s><s>each of these tags occurs on a cfm page.</s><s> opening that page counts as one http request, something like 'get mypage.cfm'.</s><s> the fusebox engine kicks off and handles the request in the usual manner, presumably without problems. 
</s><s>however, in each case, there is a second request, an ajax request generated by the bind.</s><s> it is actually generated by javascript code in the original page mypage.cfm.</s><s> coldfusion had automatically embedded the javascript as part of the response to the request for mypage.cfm.</s><s> the second request is something like 'get siteaddresses.cfc?method=getsiteaddresses&_cf_ajaxproxytoken=67e4609e 9e8a7f998867&_cf_clientid=0e09335044a83c729fd95ae3ef8aa869&returnforma t=json&argumentcollection=...etc., etc'.</s><s> coldfusion includes parameters like _cf_ajaxproxytoken and _cf_clientid in the ajax code to act as unique identifiers. 
</s><s>that is then what happens under the hood.</s><s> it seems that, in your case, the combination of coldfusion and fusebox is having trouble processing the second request.</s><s> which raises 2 questions: 
1) what version of fusebox do you use?</s><s> different fusebox versions require different configuration techniques for processing requests involving cfcs.</s><s> 2) the following exception suggests that the essential file fbx_fusebox30_cf50.cfm was included.</s><s> this in turn suggests that its parent page, index.cfm, did run.</s><s> <quote>
<s>16:00:24.024 - missinginclude exception - in /var/www/html/dynamic/fbx_fusebox30_cf50.cfm : line 276 could not find the included template circuits/admin/fbx_layouts.cfm. 
</s></quote>
</s><s>now consider the other exception: <quote>
<s>element fuseboxosname is undefined in request.</s><s> the error occurred in /var/www/html/dynamic/fbx_settings.cfm: line 63 
</s></quote>
</s><s>this tells us that fbx_settings.cfm was included in fbx_fusebox30_cf50.cfm as expected.</s><s> to summarize, index.cfm includes fbx_fusebox30_cf50.cfm which in turn includes fbx_settings.cfm.</s><s> furthermore, we take it for granted that the code in index.cfm that sets the variable request.fuseboxosname occurs before the cfinclude tag.</s><s> otherwise there would have been obvious errors during normal cfm requests.</s><s> so what does this tell us? 
</s><s>it leads me to one conclusion.</s><s> when the request generated from a bind is processed, it bypasses the code in index.cfm that sets the variable request.fuseboxosname.

i also went into the ?"neo-security.xml" file and changed the "admin.security.enabled" boolean value from "true" to "false" to get into the administrator without a password.</s><s> i was able to login to the administrator without a password but when i made a change and hit "submit" it didn't accept the change and it gave me an error: "there was an error accessing this page, check logs for more details. 
</s><s>the log file showed the following error: "there was an error while verifying the token.</s><s> either the session timed out or un-authenticated access is suspected." 
</s><s>i'm not really sure what else to do at this point besides re-install coldfusion which is my last resort on a production server.</s><s> if anyone has any possible solutions please let me know.

<post author="slevy566" timestamp="Jul 12, 2012 4:35 PM">
<s>my setup iis7 windows 2008 r2 with coldfusion 9 on a virtual server, using windows authentication.</s><s> windows authentication worked perfectly in the previous version of iis and on a conventional server setup and coldfusion 8.</s><s> now when a person without permission requests a file in a protected folder, they are denied all files except the .cfm file.</s><s> that file displays all the text. 
</s><s>since this is iis7 there is no "check that file exists setting" but this is supposed to be handled through the handler mappings.</s><s> the wildcard is mapped as well as the .cfm, .cfml etc specific extensions. 
</s><s>documentation says: how does the coldfusion service interact with iis in terms of security?</s><s> cf runs as a separate service, but it also integrates with iis using an isapi extension.</s><s> the isapi extension runs in-process with iis, just like the asp engine, and when a request is received that is mapped to the file extension associated with the isapi extension (typically .cfm and .dbm, although those can be changed in the iis management console), the request is forwarded to the cf service for processing.</s><s> iis and nt security are used to determine whether the user can request the file in the first place.</s><s> this happens before the request is forwarded to the cf service.</s><s> so, you'll generally follow the same procedure for securing cf applications with acls that you would with an asp application.

<s>hello friends,

</s><s>from what i have read, the failure, "websocket connection to ws://localhost:8585/cfusion' failed: error during websocket handshake: sec-websocket-protocol mismatch"is either a result of either two things: 1) chrome is no longer following the rfc6455 4.2.2 standard, or 2).</s><s> they are now adhering strictly to the rfc and the coldfusion server's non-compliance of the parameter is breaking the handshake. 
i have read that some developers whom are implementing ws on node.js and php, are completely removing the sec-websocket-protocol from the header to solve the problem.</s><s> luckily, i am still in development and have not experienced an outage because of the mixup.</s><s> i have reported the issue to the bug tracking system, id: 3645217. 
</s><s>if you have also run into the issue, please make a note on the bug to help escalate to our friends at adobe.</s><s> they are working hard to make coldfusion one of the best server-side technolgies around, but we need to get their attention on this one as it is a non-starter, web-socket killer!

<s>i've encountered this same bug.  man, what is with october and software time-bombs!  there was just a time-bomb with visual studio and ssdt that went off on oct 6th because of some bug involving an expired certificate, making it impossible to install stuff without temporarily setting back the system clock: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/sqlserver/en-us/51ef983f-1f07- 41b4-bad4-3541e93d4647/known-issue-ssdt-install-fails-validating-certi ficates?forum=ssdt&prof=required   anyway, i just moved everything to a new server and thought i had something configured wrong, until i realized i could connect from my desktop's browser, but not the one on the server.</s><s> in fact, it's chrome 30 that seems to be the culprit, because while i can connect fine on chrome 29, i can no longer connect on chrome 30.</s><s> of course, this is a javascript websocket issue, and i'm running iis 8, so i think this is strictly a chrome issue, independent of coldfusion or iis 8 (since i'm using iis8 and you're using coldfusion and we're both experiencing the problem).   the error i get is "websocket connection to 'wss://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/ws.ashx' failed: error during websocket handshake: sec-websocket-protocol mismatch".
