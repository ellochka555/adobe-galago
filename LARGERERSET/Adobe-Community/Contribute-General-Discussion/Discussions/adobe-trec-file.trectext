<subject>Contribute Role Setting for Pasting Content from Word</subject>
<post author="Andy Shaffer" timestamp="Mar 17, 2014 9:21 AM">
<s>in troubleshooting another dreamweaver/contribute issue, i came across some settings in the administrative file that holds the contribute user role information for a site (_mm/cthub########.csi).</s><s> in disecting that file i found two settings in particular... 
<paste_word_as_is value='true' /> <paste_word_text_only value='false' /> 
</s><s>this peaked my interest because i've always had problems with our content editors copying/pasting directly from word without taking the time to clean up their content.</s><s> but if these settings exist in this file, why can't i find the setting through contribute's administrative interface? 
</s><s>either way, i wanted to see if changing these would effect how contribute pasts content copied from word.</s><s> first i changed the paste_word_text_only value to 'true' and it worked, it sucessfully stripped out all the stylings from word.</s><s> i also changed the paste_word_as_is value back and forth but it didn't seem to have any effect on the content. 
</s><s>so my first question is, do these settings exist through the administrative interface?</s><s>?</s><s> i've looked and looked, yet i cannot find these 2 settings.

<s>update: 
</s><s>i've done some more testing and am convinced i found a software bug in how dreamweaver and contribute interacts with a certain combination of steps.</s><s> i'll map out exactly what i've done and how i've gotten around it, in case it helps someone reading this thread... 
</s><s>scenario 
</s><s>you have a site where templates are managed with dreamweaver and child pages are edited by contribute.</s><s> you then have a template with at least 1 repeating region in it, and you'd like to add another repeating region. 
</s><s>what does not work...</s><s> adding the new repeating region to the template and updating all child pages that use it.</s><s> note 1: this problem only occurs on pages that have been edited by contribute. 
</s><s>what does work...</s><s> duplicate the template under a new name, add the new repeating region and save it.</s><s> now apply the new template to all the child pages of the previous template.</s><s> note 1: if naming conventions are an issue, you can always delete the previous template and rename the new template after you've moved all the child pages.</s><s> note 2: if you are working with a huge site as i am and need to apply the new duplicate template to multiple pages at once, there are round about ways to do it with find/replace.</s><s> just google it. 
</s><s>there are a ton of other combinations of adding different types of template regions or parameters that i did not test.</s><s> but i did test thuroughly that this will happen when attempting to add an additional repeating region to a template that already has one, if the pages are being edited with contribute.

<s>i have downloaded the trial version of adobe contribute yesterday and am receiving the following message when editing a page: 'you can't perform this operation on this page now because (username) is currently editing or reveiwing it'. 
</s><s>the program was originally installed on another computer (version cs3) but crashed and we are unable to find the original software (due to multiple staff member changes since the time it was purchased in 2007) – when i contacted the support team they advised that i could either find the serial number and call back (which i have done but after holding for well over an hour and a half had to give up as i have a job to do) or download the trial version to patch up the site which is where i have encountered the above problem.
