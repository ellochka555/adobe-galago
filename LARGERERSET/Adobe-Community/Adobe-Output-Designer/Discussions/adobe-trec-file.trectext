<s>i may not hit on it exactly, but this sounds like adobe's processing order.</s><s> it wants to process the fields in the order they are in the dat file. 
i have a similar problem with an overflow field, that isnt last in the dat file, read this here: 
http://forums.adobe.com/message/2298283#2298283 
now that may not be exactly your issue, but i think its the same inherent problem, adobes processing order for the fields/subforms. 
i am still trying to resolve my issue, but found the ^field command in the reference manual (print agent), and am wondering if i can use it.

<subject>How to align fields, text, etc in a form to match a mockup.</subject>
<post author="ofilha" timestamp="Sep 23, 2009 8:40 AM">
<s>hello all, i am working with output designer and i am trying to align fields in a form i am working on to the mockup that is used as the model.</s><s> i tried to measure the distance between a field and a margin on the mockup and use the same measurements on my form, then i do a view and print the view.</s><s> what happens is that the alignment is way off.</s><s> i end up going and superimposing my form on the mockup against the light, and by trial and error i move my fields to the location i want, but i am finding myself doing this over and over and it is taking quite a bit of paper in order to get the fields aligned as the mockup. 
i am wondering if anyone has any suggestions for dealing with this problem.

<s>there are several tools that can help you align objects.</s><s> the easiest is the "align area" tool.</s><s> select the objects that you want to align then go to "area" then "align area" and pick the alignment you want. 
</s><s>if you are dealing with fields it will help if the fields all have the same justification (top left for example). 
you can also scan in your model and bring it in as background so you can see what you're doing (see trace template under the tools menu).
