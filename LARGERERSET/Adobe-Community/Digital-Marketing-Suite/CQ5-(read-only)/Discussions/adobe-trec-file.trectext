<subject>Page impressions from multiple publish servers</subject>
<post author="tb7032" timestamp="Jul 18, 2012 5:15 AM">
<s>hi, 
</s><s>i'm wondering if anybody has any strategies / experience using cq's inbuilt analytics (ie impressions) from multiple publish servers. 
</s><s>in cq deployments i've been involved in, we've used 'external' analytics and the client's custom templates have not included '/libs/foundation/components/page/stats.jsp'.</s><s> however, i'd like to understand if i'm missing something here... 
</s><s>if the stats were collected on each of the publish servers, there doesn't seem to be any mechanism for automatically aggregating them back on the author server (which would appear to be required for the display in the authoring ui to be useful). 
i can see that the servlet endpoint for 'recording' the impression (/libs/wcm/stats/tracker.js) can be configured to point elsewhere... however is the recommendation really to point this back to the author environment?</s><s> is that really the suggested architecture though? 
</s><s>even aside from the fact that you might not want your author 'externally' accessible (which i guess could be avoided by adding a servlet to publish which 'proxies' the request back to author, or using mod_proxy), surely, letting load from the publish servers anywhere near author doesn't sound like a great idea, plus there's all sorts of authentication issues here.</s><s> this can be easily demonstrated by firing up a local author and publish, and browsing the geometrixx online site on publish as an unauthenticated user (watch for 403s for /tracker.js). 
i would imagine the concerns above might also apply to the mvt capabilities (although i notice they use a separate tracking endpoint). 
am i missing something fundamental here about how this should be leveraged?

<s>all - wanted to know if anybody is having a similar experience in upgrading from cq (aem) 5.6 to 5.6.1, and whether you could suggest a remedy.   the problem we're having with 5.6.1 can be replicated easily on an aws linux instance installing a fresh 5.6.1 installation (i.e. bypassing any upgrade that would happen by installing 5.6.0 first) and following the instructions provided by aem at https://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/deploying/installing_cq.html#to mcat%207.</s><s> steps to replicate: 1.</s><s> [ok] launch a fresh aws linux installation using the latest ami provided by amazon 2.</s><s> [ok] install oracle java (1.7.0_25) and tomcat 7 (7.0.40 - which is the latest version provided by amazon); tomcat 7 is configured to use oracle java 3.</s><s> [ok] follow the instructions provided to configure tomcat7 and aem author 4.</s><s> [ok] visit the login page on the aem author - this works 5.</s><s> [ok] stop tomcat7 6.</s><s> [ok] start tomcat7 7.</s><s> [fail] visit the login page on the aem author - this hangs, telneting to the http port used by tomcat doesn't connect so basically everything is fine until you restart tomcat.</s><s> the same behaviour is observed when doing an upgrade - so doing an inplace upgrade from 5.6.0 to 5.6.1 succeeds but breaks when the tomcat service is restarted.   all comments warmly received.</s><s> thanks

<subject>Caching Client Libraries</subject>
<post author="Kristian Wright" timestamp="Jul 28, 2013 11:52 PM">
<s>does cq have a built in way to deal with client library caching issues?</s><s> when using the foundation image component, the final src attribute of the image in the clients browser is something like: 
<img title="my image" alt="my image" src="/content/myapp/en/mypage/_jcr_content/somewhere/my_image.img.png /1368587149255.png"> 
</s><s>this allows the browser to cache the image, but when the image is updated in cq, the src attribute is updated accordingly, and therefore the new image is requested by the browser. 
</s><s>does cq also have this kind of functionality for it's client libraries, so that javascript and css files can be cached in the same sort of way, and automatically get renewed when updated?</s><s> for example, something like: 
<script type="text/javascript" src="/etc/designs/myapp/myclientlib_1368587149255.js"></script> <link rel="stylesheet" href="/etc/designs/myapp/myclientlib_1368587149255.css" type="text/css"/> 
i know we could set the expires headers, but this is not the most efficient way since the files may not have changes since since they were last requested.

<s>this should work, perhaps it's that <%currentnode.getpath();%> doesn't output anything in your form action (to output use <%= property %> without the semicolon instead of the scriptlet <% %> which just evaluates the contents instead of outputing), it seems cq inserts a parent there in the action for some reason, in your case /content, so your form is posting to /content which isn't where your post.jsp is located.</s><s> the path you really probably want is to post directly to your component, which would look something like /content/trainingsite/_jcr_content.html which would be output by <%= currentnode.getpath() %>.html, i used the ${currentnode.path} / ${currentpage.path} el syntax in my example because i think it's cleaner looking and avoids the scriptlet confusion. 
</s><s>that said, why not just use the sling post servlet [1] which will save the contents of the form and use the redirect option to avoid the standard sling output (note the ./ prefix to the property names, this tells the post servlet to store that value at wherever your form action is posting to):

<subject>Handling custom (localized) error pages</subject>
<post author="RNI76" timestamp="Jul 28, 2013 11:59 PM">
<s>on our site, we'd like to be able to maintain and serve custom/localized error pages in the end-users' own language rather than just a standard customized page like /apps/sling/servlet/errorhandler/404.jsp. 
</s><s>right now, we're storing these localized pages as /content/<country>/<language>/errors/<errorcode>.html (e.g. /content/be/nl/errors/404.html), allowing editors to maintain them. 
</s><s>normally, it wouldn't be hard to find and serve the correct page.</s><s> you could just serve http://www.mysite.com/content/gb/en/errors/404.html if the users tries to fetch the non-existing page http://www.mysite.com/content/gb/en/invalidpage.html. 
</s><s>the problem is that we've got an apache server doing rewriting in front of cq like this: 
/content/gb/en/products.html -> gb.mysite.com/products.html 
- so when trying to determine which page to serve to the user, we use hard-coded reverse mappings (gb.mysite.com -> /content/gb/en/). 
</s><s>the thing is, the webmasters need to be able to set up error pages for a new country site without contacting a developer to get the mappings updated. 
</s><s>but how do i figure out which page to serve without using mappings? 
</s><s>ideally, i'd like to use a "site setting" per site, allowing the webmaster to define e.g. /content/gb/en/errors as the "base path" for error pages.</s><s> but when all i've got to go on is a request for e.g. http://gb.mysite.com/invalid.html, then all i can do is try to find the nearest correct parent that resolves to a page - which would then be "/".</s><s> i thought i could resolve the full path of this root page to /content/gb/en/, but no luck. 
</s><s>any ideas on how to handle this?</s><s> any and all suggestions would be most welcome!

if yes, then can you try to modify your pom.xml to use correct vault plugin

</s><s>use below (latest) 
<groupid>com.day.jcr.vault</groupid> <artifactid>content-package-maven-plugin</artifactid> <version>0.0.14</version>

<s>looking closer at your pom files, i see you're declaring parent poms which will allow for dependency inheritence, etc. but i don't see that you've defined the child poms as modules to the parent, which gives you project aggregation in maven. 
</s><s>if you place in your parent/pom.xml something like this: 
<modules> <module>../core</module> <module>../app</module> </modules> 
i think you'll get closer.</s><s> but you've also got an empty core project which i think maven is going to complain about.</s><s> also, in my opinion the root at myproject/pom.xml and parent/pom.xml are a little redundant.</s><s> consider making the myproject/pom.xml the "true" parent project by copy/pasting the contents of parent/pom.xml into /myproject/pom.xml, remove parent/pom.xml altogether, and then the above module lines would be: 
<modules> <module>core</module> <module>app</module> </modules>

<s>hi everyone.   i have also spent some time trying to built a custom extjs dialog that has a multifield with a textfield and a pathfield with the help of the "using extjs widgets" examples from the package share.   my problem is that the example saves the values in a stringarray (string[]) with a seperator character and the user can mess up the input by typing that seperator character.</s><s> i have tried to alter my code to use json like shelly suggested, but it didn't work and i got following error message in firebug: "uncaught exception: cannot create component: xtype 'ejstcustom' not found and no default supplied."   is there some way to save the values in a child-node of the component node in separate properties instead of the string[]?   here's my code: ejst.customwidget = cq.ext.extend(cq.form.compositefield, {       /**      * @private      * @type cq.ext.form.textfield      */     hiddenfield: null,       /**      * @private      * @type cq.ext.form.textfield      */     namefield: null,       /**      * @private      * @type cq.ext.form.pathfield      */     linkpathfield: null,         constructor: function(config) {         config = config || { };         var defaults = {             "border": false,             "layout": "table",             "columns":2         };         config = cq.util.applydefaults(config, defaults);         ejst.customwidget.superclass.constructor.call(this, config);     },       // overriding cq.ext.component#initcomponent     initcomponent: function() {         ejst.customwidget.superclass.initcomponent.call(this);           this.hiddenfield = new cq.ext.form.hidden({             name: this.name         });         this.add(this.hiddenfield);           this.namefield= new cq.ext.form.textfield({             cls:"ejst-customwidget-2",             listeners: {                 change: {                     scope:this,                     fn:this.updatehidden                 }             }         });         this.add(this.namefield);           this.linkpathfield= new cq.form.pathfield({             rootpath: "/content",             predicate: "nosystem",             showtitlesintree: true,             allowblank: false,             listeners: {                 change: {                     scope:this,                     fn:this.updatehidden                 },                 dialogclose : {                     scope:this,                     fn:this.updatehidden                 }             }                     });         this.add(this.linkpathfield);       },         processinit: function (path, record) {         this.namefield.processinit(path, record);         this.linkpathfield.processinit(path, record);     },       // overriding cq.form.compositefield#setvalue      setvalue: function (value) {         var parts = value.split("|");         this.namefield.setvalue(parts[0]);         this.linkpathfield.setvalue(parts[1]);         this.hiddenfield.setvalue(value);     },       // overriding cq.form.compositefield#getvalue     getvalue: function() {         return this.getrawvalue();     },       getrawvalue: function () {         return this.namefield.getvalue() + "|" +                this.linkpathfield.getvalue();     },       // private     updatehidden: function() {         this.hiddenfield.setvalue(this.getvalue());     }   });   // register xtype cq.ext.reg('ejstcustom', ejst.customwidget); edit: here is my dialog.xml:     <?</s><s>xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?</s><s>> <jcr:root xmlns:cq="http://www.day.com/jcr/cq/1.0" xmlns:jcr="http://www.jcp.org/jcr/1.0" xmlns:nt="http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0"     jcr:primarytype="cq:dialog"     warnifmodified="{boolean}false"     xtype="dialog">     <items         jcr:primarytype="cq:widget"         xtype="tabpanel">         <items jcr:primarytype="cq:widgetcollection">             <first                 jcr:primarytype="cq:widget"                 title="multi-field"                 xtype="panel">                 <items jcr:primarytype="cq:widgetcollection">                     <multi                         jcr:primarytype="cq:widget"                         fieldlabel="multi-field"                         hidelabel="{boolean}true"                         name="./multi"                         xtype="multifield">                         <fieldconfig                             jcr:primarytype="nt:unstructured"                             xtype="ejstcustom"/>                     </multi>                 </items>             </first>         </items>     </items> </jcr:root>

<s>from my understanding, the way cq's ldapusersync work is that it will import and create the ldap groups that is under the defined grouproot that that user is a member of.</s><s> one problem is that cq's ldapusersync isn't compatible with your ldap schema.</s><s> we had this problem initially because of the way we were storing groups in ldap. 
</s><s>we were initially storing our group information in an object which has a member of locally defined attributes and stores the members of the group in multi-valued "memberuid" attributes (e.g.</s><s> murali).</s><s> cq assumes that the value of the member attribute has the form of the fully qualified name (e.g. uid=murali,ou=users accounts (unsorted),dc=us,dc=ad,dc=com).</s><s> so when it searches for group members it searches for "memberuid=uid=murali,ou=users accounts (unsorted),dc=us,dc=ad,dc=com" which produces no match. 
</s><s>now, we have since changed our ldap schema to match this, however, we are still unhappy with the cq ldapusersync.</s><s> problem we have discovered is that when it creates cq groups pulled from ldap, it creates the group with the id using the principal-name which is the full dn in ldap.</s><s> for example, it will actually create the ldap group of ebt-iwov as /home/groups/c/cn/cn=ebt-iwov,ou=ebt,ou=user and group accounts,dc=us,dc=ad,dc=com (if using <param name="defaultdepth" value="3"/> for the com.day.crx.core.crxusermanagerimpl in repository.xml).</s><s> this is a problem for us because it would result in a very flat group hiearchy in the repository, creating 1000's of group records under the same node of /home/groups/c/cn/. 
</s><s>since crx2.2 (cq5.4) the usermanager api has been updated to allow for creating groups with arbitrary groupd ids (e.g.</s><s> cn valud of the ldap group).</s><s> however, we were disappointed to discover that in 5.5 the ldapusersync hasn't been updated yet to make use of new api.</s><s> so since 5.4, we've been managing groups manually using scripts and we automate the synching vai cron job. 
</s><s>within the cq higher education group, i don't believe anyone uses the ldapusersync for group integration simply because of its limitations.

</s><s>the changes to ldap setup between cq 5.4 and 5.5 are minimal (and mainly just not particularly clear) but the documentation on the support site has yet to reflect it.</s><s> in cq 5.5 (a fresh install) you will not get a /crx-quickstart/server/etc/sample_ldap_login.conf file to modify.</s><s> however, it's still appropriate to use in 5.5 as jaas configs are a standard for the jvm.</s><s> also, beware if you enable jaas in the quickstart script that comes with 5.5, it has an order of parameters issue and jaas configs won't parse correctly, you'll need to specify the jaas config prior to the -jar jvm option. 
</s><s>in short if you are a new cq user to 5.5 and looking for ldap integration simply use the sample on the support site but refernce the configuration in the jvm as a command-line option rather than trying to figure out why /server/etc no longer exists.
