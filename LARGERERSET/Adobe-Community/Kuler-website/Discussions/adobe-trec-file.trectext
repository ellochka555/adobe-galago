<subject>New beta features (August) - feedback please</subject>
<post author="Dave E" timestamp="Aug 8, 2013 8:49 AM">
<s>we've added a few more beta features for you to check out.Ê in this post, i'll explain what's changed and how you view/use the new features.Ê please reply to this post to share your feedback. Ê features enabled for this group: (click this link to view the features: https://kuler.adobe.com/features/enable/newfeatures) Ê we have created a special link to give you access to new features (new feature link)--without this link you won't be able to see the new features.Ê this link will allow you to use the site, same as before, but will also enable the new features that we're looking for feedback on.Ê so, here's an overview of what's new: Ê (1) re-order swatches: you can re-order the colors in your swatch simply by clicking and, while continuing to press down, drag the color to the desired location.Ê give it a try and let us know what you think.</s><s> (2)"slider" editing controls: previously we had one slider that controlled the brightness level of your color - we've added a slider control for each value in the color space you are editing.Ê for example, if you are working in the rgb color space, you will see a slider control for "r", "g", and "b".Ê for rgb, you will see a 4th control, set apart from the others, that allows you to control brightness.Ê each control provides a visual spectrum which will allow you to visually edit your colors with more precision.Ê Ê note, we are still working out a few performance issues for these features on the android default browser and windows surface.Ê ideally, you will have access to another browser to test these features on.Ê Ê in addition to the beta features mentioned above, we've also rolled out several features which were previously in beta.Ê those features include creating themes from an image, resizable color wheel, and less distracting borders.</s><s> that's it for now.Ê we look forward to reading your feedback!

<s>looking better and better! 
i am testing in google chrome in windows 
1) reorder swatches - this works as described.</s><s> click, drag and drop.</s><s> it will be good to have this feature back.</s><s> on the down side, sometimes changing the base color causes the swatches to reorder... and sometimes the button to set the base color does not respond at all while the swatches shuffle.</s><s> it hasn't been consistent enough to track down a cause. 
2) slider editing controls - good to see these back, too!</s><s> these greatly speed coarse adjustments to colors, while using the cursor keys in the number fields allows for finer deatail control of the number.</s><s> seems to work as intended with my brief testing.</s><s> a possible option would be to have a toggle to switch between the full sliders and the brightness slider for those that preferred the other way or that simply wish to simplify/minimise the appearance (i like the full slider control, but at times could see the simpler view beneficial as an option). 
</s><s>thanks for the opportunity to preview these features! 
-mt 
edit: another thing that seems to work better now is the list of color spaces.</s><s> it no longer jumps open on hovering over it.</s><s> i like that it retains the view setting (open to full list or 'minimized' to hex + 1) regardless of the pointer hovering over it. 
</s><s>feature request: on the sliders, perhaps you can add/enable a set of sliders for the hex values?</s><s>.</s><s> perhaps add an option to minimize the color space list to only hex values?</s><s>.</s><s> this could be beneficial for those that work in hex color values only.</s><s> and, since this is all hypotheical for now, perhaps a toggle to enable or disable a limit to web-safe colors when tweaking hex values via sliders?

<subject>Thoughts on the site re-design from the Kuler team</subject>
<post author="Dave E" timestamp="May 30, 2013 7:24 AM">
<s>today we're launching the new site and making kuler available on the app store for ios.</s><s> we've worked really hard to make kuler easier to work with and accessible on all your devices.</s><s> and, we have a lot more planned.</s><s> so, let us know what you think. 
</s><s>if you are an active kuler user, you may notice a few pages and features missing from the new kuler website.</s><s> i'm writing to explain what's missing, why it's missing, and what you can expect to see in the coming weeks and months.</s><s> here's an overview of what you won't find on the new site: 
create a theme from an image: we know many users really like the "create from an image" feature.</s><s> unfortunately, this feature was not ready for the new site launch.</s><s> so, rather than launching a buggy or half-baked feature, we decided to take a bit more time to get it right. 
</s><s>we intend to add this feature to the site as soon as it's ready.</s><s> until then, you can use the free iphone app to create themes from images. 
</s><s>color space "slider" controls: we talked to a lot of kuler users about the slider controls.</s><s> some users like them and others don't.</s><s> the main complaint we heard was that the sliders add unnecessary complexity and take up too much space. 
</s><s>so, we opted to not add the sliders and err on the side of making the creation experience simple.</s><s> though, we decided to keep the "brightness" slider control since some colors spaces don't have a brightness variable.</s><s> we'd love to know what you think.</s><s> you can voice your opinion here on the forum. 
</s><s>change the order of colors: in our research, we found most users did not know you could re-order colors on the old kuler site.</s><s> and, it's actually quite a bit of work to build this feature.</s><s> so, rather than re-building a feature many users don't know about or use, we wanted to hear from you first.</s><s> i created an idea for this feature on the forum.</s><s> please add your vote if you think this feature should be worked on immediately. 
</s><s>avatar: most of the users we talked with about kuler avatars were indifferent.</s><s> in fact, they asked us to focus on other features first.</s><s> so, that's what we're doing--we're focusing on some of the most requested features first. 
</s><s>community spotlight and pulse: the community spotlight and pulse were beta features that never really gained any traction.</s><s> so, we opted to not continue with these features. 
</s><s>api: we're working to rebuild the kuler api to offer more robust capababilities.</s><s> until then, we're no longer issuing new api keys.</s><s> if you already have a key and are using the api, your service will not be interupted (your key will continue to work). 
</s><s>we're always looking for feedback and would love to hear what you think about any of these topics-please join the discussion here on the forum.

<s>hi dave, 
</s><s>yes, that's what i mean. 
</s><s>taking a further look at this thing... guys, the old app was so much better.</s><s> i used hsv almost exclusively and that's gone.</s><s> why?</s><s> 
</s><s>why is the color wheel in front of the palette?</s><s> seriously.</s><s> why?</s><s> 
</s><s>one of my peeves about the old kuler app was how difficult it was to remove the white line around the current color.</s><s> with some manipulation this could be done, at least when creating colors from photos.</s><s> the designer wants to be able to see his/her colors next to each other and against black or dark grey.</s><s> we do not want shadows, lines, borders, or anything else in the way. 
</s><s>please restore the old look.</s><s> i hate to beg, but honestly, it was simple, beautiful, and it worked, albeit some of the time.</s><s> this is "pretty" but not particularly useful.</s><s> it might be beneficial for you guys to work with designers to see what they actually do when they use the old software - and then build your new version around that. 
</s><s>kuler was honestly the best app for building color schemes.</s><s> it wasn't great.</s><s> but it was the best that was available - largely because of the large boxes, the simple view, and the ability to see the colors right next to each other.</s><s> it could have been great by just adding a few more features.</s><s> this redesign has set you back.</s><s> you've lost the great features that you had all for a "pretty" appearence.

<s>about the slider controls for the team: 
one of the nice things about the slider controls is that it allows a designer to experiment with color.</s><s> for example, a designer could edit another color scheme by sliding only the hue slider for example, leaving all the other values the same.</s><s> or changing only the saturation.</s><s> having to type in numbers to do that means it is unlikely anyone will want to do that. 
</s><s>adding a feature that would allow users to control all the sliders at once on a custom theme would be awesome.</s><s> maybe a little lock feature would allow a custom theme to behave like a standard one.</s><s> ?</s><s>?</s><s>?</s><s> 
</s><s>tabbing from one value to the next: 
i'm not sure how the old system worked because i always used hsb which was on the top, but you should be able to tab to the next value in the color picker you are using.</s><s> right now tabbing through hsb sends me to hex and then to cmyk. 
</s><s>please put back the ability to create a new theme from an old one simply by changing the name or alternatively, add a duplicate button to start a new theme from an old one. 
</s><s>definitely lose the black borders around all the themes. 
</s><s>it was probably not a good idea to release this new version without the ability to create schemes from photos.</s><s> i'm willing to bet that your hits dropped when you did that.</s><s> it was probably the most popular way of creating schemes - and not just for designers either.</s><s> why not wait until everything was ready?</s><s> or release a beta version at another address?</s><s> as it is, maybe you can put the old one back at another address... 
</s><s>if you want to add functionality rather than subtract it - a color tester would be a nice feature.</s><s> for example testing on a sample web page would be a very useful tool.</s><s> i do something like this using illustrator's recolor feature (make it more intuitive than that, though.</s><s>) pattern testing, too.</s><s> there are color testers out there, but kuler was more intuitive, and had the ability to assert more control over the color, so it was preferrable.

<s>i was attempting to use kuler as a means to unite all the adobe programs around my color templates.</s><s> with this use in mind, i was definitely interested in seeing the option to add more colors.</s><s> strangely enough, however, i've learned kuler doesn't sync with photoshop cc (you can save to the web from it, but you can't download to ps from kuler,) so i'm not entirely sure how useful this is to me.</s><s> i have to manually download the profiles and drag them into the swatches category in order to use them, which to be fair is pretty useful (better than me manually entering them) - but it's a far cry from the ideal cloud-based organization structure of having your pallette's right where you need them in all your adobe applications. 
</s><s>my two cents: adobe needs a much more comprehensive overhaul for tieing in professional pallette's.</s><s> this may be kuler, or it may not... either way, i see no difference thus far between using the products as i used to and using the creative cloud.</s><s> when i think of cloud-based products i think of everything i need being tied to my account.</s><s> currently that's not possible with colors, it seems. 
</s><s>for what it's worth, i think it's implemented very well in indesign, so with that respect i think kuler is great save for the limitation of 5 colors.</s><s> perhaps it's worth having a "create" category, and a "library" category - that way you can label each color and save them in any amount you wish for retention of your current pallette's.</s><s> i think that would be really cool - and if it was tied into photoshop the same way it is tied into indesign it would be nearly perfect.</s><s> seems like a relatively small tweak to the overall structure with a big payoff for us professionals if it can be implemented.

<s>creative cloud users can access all their themes directly within illustrator cc.</s><s> to access your themes, open the kuler panel by choosing window > kuler.</s><s> you can also access your themes and create new ones in the latest version of adobe ideas. 
</s><s>for users who prefer to explore and browse themes created by members of the kuler community first, we recommend using the web site-where you will find robust search, filter, and browsing capabilities.</s><s> once you find something you like, simply mark it as favorite and then refresh your kuler panel in illustrator. 
</s><s>for photoshop¨, indesign¨, fireworks¨, and flash¨ professional: find the new kuler panel by choosing window > kuler .</s><s> this new panel displays all of your public themes. 
</s><s>for users working on older versions of adobe software (cs4, & cs5), kuler themes can also be downloaded for use in adobe software using the adobe swatch exchange (.ase) format.</s><s> to download a theme from kuler , first make sure you're signed in.</s><s> click on the theme you'd like and click download.</s><s> this downloads the theme as an .ase file to the location of your choice.

<s>hi neha, 
</s><s>i was experienceing the same issue, (or at least, similar symptoms). 
</s><s>for clarification, kuler.adobe.com loads fine.</s><s> however, as soon as you click on anything, the screen turns "blank".</s><s> by this, i mean only the background is visible, there is no colour-wheel, no header, no footer, only background.

</s><s>hope this helps your team come up with a solution, as this extension is quite popular.</s><s> i've been using it for a while and it only started to cause issues in the last month (jan 2014), however i'm unsure if this is due to an update to the extension or your webpage.

<s>oddly, this worked for me as was suggested earlier...
