<s>hi djlotus, 
i received your email, but unfortunately there was no zip file attached. 
</s><s>however - the fact that your adobeonlinedefault registry value is set to 0 is very likely to be the problem. 
</s><s>setting this value to 0 tells adobe extensions "do not connect to the internet" - and setting it to 1 allows extensions to connect to the internet.</s><s> it's very odd that this value was set to 0 in your registry - perhaps another extension on your machine previously set this property to 0 without intending to affect other extensions.</s><s> can you try changing this value to 1, restarting your computer, and then opening the exchange panel again?

<s>hi, i've been trying for a while now to just get the exchange extension working in photoshop cc. 
1.</s><s> first photoshop needed to be updated, did that.</s><s> 2. then i installed extension manager, did that.</s><s> 3. then apparently had to update both, did that.</s><s> 4. then tried to open the exchange extension in ps cc, it tells me to "click update for the latest features." i clicked update...</s><s> 5. another dialog in the extension pops up and says "a newer version of the exchange panel is available.</s><s> would you like to install it?" i click yes...</s><s> 6. it then downloads the extension, about 14mb 7. then it tries to install it, but says "adobe extension manager is required to install this extension.</s><s> do you want to launch extension manager now?".</s><s> i click yes... 
</s><s>the panel just sits there spinning the wait wheel.</s><s> it sat there for 5 mins before i killed the panel. 

</s><s>so then i thought i'll just get the latest version of the panel from http://www.adobeexchange.com/ 
1.</s><s> went to http://www.adobeexchange.com/ and clicked the "download" button 2.</s><s> i chose download for cc.</s><s> 3.</s><s> i waited for it to download, then doublie clicke the zxp which opened extension manager cc.</s><s> extension manager cc then pops up a dialog saying it's installing the extension. 
</s><s>extension manager then pops up a message: "the entension 'adobeexchange' does not contain a valid signature.</s><s> the extnesion will not be installed."

<s>hi all, a redesign of the adobe exchange has been released.</s><s> thanks to all who have participated in discussions over the past many months reviewing comps, schematics, and beta versions.</s><s> with this release we believe we have fixed the major inconveniences users have reported over the past months.</s><s> clearly there is more work to be done and we will continue to be in communication about where we can next take this experience.</s><s> some release notes: there are "empty" stars next to the existing (pre-may, 17) comments in the comments section of the item detail page.</s><s> in the new version of the exchange we have the ability to show a rating next to comments in each commenters post.</s><s> but since this data relationship did not exist in the prior version, all comments already in the system as of may 17, 2007 have a set of blank stars next to them (but dont worry; the rating each person submitted before is still in the system and goes into the current aggregate rating of the exchange item).</s><s> in other words, no data is lost.</s><s> we have just created a way to display ratings attached to comments for all subsequent comments.</s><s> authors/contributors are listed in orange we did this to raise the visibility of contributors.</s><s> whenever you see an authors name, if you click it you will go to a page of exchange items uploaded by that author.</s><s> in some cases exchange items have long urls in the description.</s><s> if the urls are long enough they have the possibility of breaking the layout of the page.</s><s> if you, as an author/contributor, see this happening in a exchange item that belongs to you, you can go edit that item to massage the text to fix the problem.</s><s> if you need help please shout.</s><s> please go ahead and note any bugs you find in this forum.</s><s> we will be checking this regularly!</s><s> i hope this release allows your participation in this lively environment to be much more smooth.</s><s> i look forward to hearing from you.</s><s> david hatch, chief information architect, adobe web team

<s>first of all: thank you very much for the hard work!</s><s> the html format is much more useful.</s><s> you can now print and search the text on a page.</s><s> "back" button works much better too.</s><s> hopefully extensions' description can now be indexed by search engines (the way it worked before the flash interface was implemented a few years ago)- so they are easier to find.</s><s> couple of quirks i have found with the beta: something is really slowing down interaction with the pages.</s><s> for example when the page loads after the search it feels like i have to wait for some invisible elements to load before i can start interacting with the page.</s><s> it feels like there is a script that is constantly running on the page and slows down the interaction.</s><s> i have tested on three different computers and had the same experience.</s><s> more importantly the search functionality seems to be downgraded from the previous version: it looks like search is conducted only within the titles of the extensions and not within the description or other fields.</s><s> in many cases in order to find an extension i have to enter its exact name!</s><s> i really hope this can be fixed!</s><s> another usability point: the default value for the category dropdown in the search should be "all" so user can search the entire exchange without an extra click.</s><s> once again, thank you for your efforts.

<s>well!</s><s> when david said, "very, very soon" to me, he meant it!</s><s> so, i've had a chance to look over the changes so far, and i'll offer my feedback on what is up there now.</s><s> first off, the positive: the biggest improvement imo is that the site is now much, much faster and more responsive!</s><s> no more waiting forever for that flash whirly-ma-gig just so you can see a simple page.</s><s> it is actually possible to stay on the site and navigate to where you want to go without becoming frustrated/bored/mummified.</s><s> the site is snappy now -- and congrats on moving way from flash into html/css, which actually works effectively!</s><s> good job!</s><s> also very nice to the update is that you can actually do effective searches!</s><s> it is very nice to be able to sort the master lists and categories by downloads, rating and date, especially.</s><s> the "filtering" feature works fine, although i believe it could be combined effectively with the broader and more comprehensive "advanced search" feature.</s><s> don't you?</s><s> in addition, it's nice to get back the capability to have the ratings attatched with the reviews!</s><s> it helps to see who rated what and why.</s><s> thank you.</s><s> the loss of (old) individual star rating info is unfortunate, but i'll live with it.</s><s> also, a new feature -- you can add ratings and reviews without having to open another page!</s><s> yay!</s><s> other nice things include getting back 300x200 previews on the description pages, the ability to contact the contributor via e-mail (although the interface for this needs tweaking **see below**), favorites and alerts.</s><s> these are a few starting steps in making the exchange interactive and user friendly.</s><s> now for areas which still need fixing/improvement: when i do a search, some weird things happen!</s><s> first of all, the results seem to be very random!</s><s> for instance, if i search for an author or name of a contribution, the results are not ordered alphabetically, by date, by rating, downloads, or any other discernible method!</s><s> why not?</s><s>?</s><s>?</s><s> also, the search results are not sortable by these methods like everything else!</s><s> it makes it difficult to find what you want or see things in an orderly manner when you get more than 2 results from your search.</s><s> this needs to be fixed/changed.</s><s> keeping on the subject of search... the "publish date" feature in the "advanced search" needs some attention.</s><s> the options available are simply not sufficient.</s><s> the maximum value you can search for is "1 year".</s><s> anything older than that simply cannot be searched for with the publish date feature.</s><s> given that there are many submissions on the exchange from 1999, 2000, etc., this needs to be changed!</s><s> there should be a "more than 1 year ago" option, or even more specific, a year-by-year option.</s><s> the "show all reviews" option on the pages needs to be implemented better imo.</s><s> as it is, it shows 5 reviews by default, and clicking "show all reviews" then shows 10 reviews, with arrows to view the next 10, etc.</s><s> i believe that if you have a link on a page that says "show all reviews" it should actually show all reviews!</s><s> it's still to hard to see them all.</s><s> alternatively, or in addition, the default contribution page should show 10 reviews by default, with arrows already in place to see the next 10 reviews.</s><s> the preview images on the list pages are still quite miniscule (sp?</s><s>).</s><s> it would certainly be nice to have these even just a little bigger (50-100%).</s><s> however, i realize that this poses another problem - horizontal page space.</s><s> let me just say that an 800x600 optimized layout for this type of a site seems rather small, don't you think?</s><s> especially on the list pages, content is "long and skinny".</s><s> i realize that the entire adobe site is built around an 800x600 layout, and this probably makes things difficult, but 1024x768 could sure make this thing nicer!</s><s> (btw - why is adobe still optimized for 800x600?</s><s>?</s><s> you can't tell me that there are people out there buying cs3 and using 800x600 resolution!</s><s> note: cnet.com, yahoo.com, etc.</s><s>) one thing that i'm disappointed not to see here (and i hope we'll see it soon) is a contributor listing and contributor profiles.</s><s> the "old" exchange had a contributor listing.</s><s> it would be nice to have that back, with sortable options for "most contributions", "highest rated", "most downloaded", most d/ls per contribution" just to name a few.</s><s> also, a contributor profile page would be really nice.</s><s> a personal page where users could see information such as contributors' website, favorite uploads, hobbies, interests, "about myself", etc., etc. speaking of contributors' websites...</s><s> i've looked for a place to add that to my uploads, and i can't find it anywhere!</s><s> some people have it, but how do i add it?</s><s> i would like the option to add it globally to all my uploads (this would make it user-friendly).</s><s> the "email author" link currently brings up a new window with a small form.</s><s> this window desperately needs just a little bit of css love applied to it.</s><s> the text is left justified with no spacing from the edge of the window, and the form boxes stretch the entire way across.</s><s> give this baby a little formatting! :-) on the individual contribution pages, the "download" box currently contains some basic information about the contribution.</s><s> i believe it should also contain the "compatible products" info, as this is something very basic that people look for, and it is too hard to find on the pages as is (also, is the "language" option necessary?</s><s> and can i enter "actionscript" or "html" as needed? :-p) the entire "additional extension information" section might be able to be done away with and the information melded into other areas of the page.</s><s> just an idea there.</s><s> this may be a little pet peeve of mine... but we used to have a little feature on the old exchange called "downloads per day" that kept a running list of the most popular new submissions.</s><s> it was an easy way to tell what the best new stuff was.</s><s> i'd like to have that back.</s><s> i did a test to try and update one of my old submissions with a new "preview" url.</s><s> the submission is still "pending" in my "uploads" list (which, btw, would be nice to have ordered sensibly and sortable), however it is still "live" on site and available for download.</s><s> in addition, the new url is also live!</s><s> now, personally, i think this is great!</s><s> i don't have to wait on some "approval" process to change something that has already been approved!</s><s> on the updates, even if the old file was still live until the approval of the update was done, that would be nice.</s><s> however, i'm wondering where the discrepancy is, since my "uploads" list says it is still awaiting approval.</s><s> on this note, i want to mention my last "negative" observation of the new exchange.</s><s> this "beta" (and thank you for calling it that, btw) went live several days ago, and there still have been no new submissions approved.</s><s> why not?</s><s>?</s><s>?</s><s> i still maintain that there needs to be someone approving these things daily (at least every business day)!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s> once a month will absolutely never do!</s><s> i don't know what it takes on the business end to allocate someone's time to make this happen, but if we're going to have an exchange, it needs to happen.</s><s> daily approvals keep people coming back.</s><s> monthly approval makes people forget. -------------------------- anyway, in conclusion... it's good to see the updates.</s><s> several key areas were addressed, and the exchange is at least usable again.</s><s> on the other side of the coin, i'm glad this is still in "beta" stage, as there are many improvements that still can/need to be made.</s><s> keep up the hard work, and keep in touch!

<s>hi markerline, Ê sorry for suggesting things you'd already tried - this kind of problem can be tricky to diagnose so i wanted to rule the obvious things out first. Ê when you install the latest adobeexchange.zxp from www.adobeexchange.com using extension manager cc, it should now be installed to: Ê c:\users\<username>\appdata\roaming\adobe\cepservicemanager4\extension s Ê out of the box, the exchange panel from the "common files" location will be loaded in apps such as photoshop, but after the exchange panel is updated they will use the newer version (stored in the user-specific "username" location). Ê if the problem still exists, what happens when you try to install the exchange panel in extension manager cc?</s><s> do you get an error, and do the contents of either of these folders change? Ê thanks for your perseverance. Ê fraser

<s>@nathanalf - i've replied to your email - let me know if it doesn't arrive.
