<subject>What's the best way to create a doodle video (with Adobe)!</subject>
<post author="wowtech" timestamp="Jan 28, 2014 11:15 AM">
<s>examples: http://sellamations.com/ or http://doodle-video.com/ 

.... but see, here's the thing - i already own the most powerful animation software around... why would i pay for it!</s><s>?</s><s> so, instead of learning all adobe programs inside and out - to figure out what my options are...</s><s> i thought i could just ask some experts! 
</s><s>please help. 
</s><s>two ways i can think of to do this with my incomplete knowledge: 1.</s><s> i can record while drawing in illustrator .</s><s> easy right?</s><s>?</s><s> but there would be no way to create a template of the drawings first without having it show up on the screen.</s><s> my style is more "play with it till it's done" when it comes to illustration. 
</s><s>the other option is to use my wacom to draw out the items, using a sheet of paper with the already drawn pic - and trace that while recording.</s><s> but.... then you would run into sizing problems...</s><s> wouldn't everything have to be exactly to scale first?</s><s> or couldn't it get cumbersome... editing it may be easier than i am envisioning - but feedback appreciated

<s>i recommend window 8 because it is the current version and will come built on a (more powerful) modern system- 8 uses less ram than 7 does to chug along.

<subject>Exporting animations containing nested movieclip symbols to .avi or .mov video formats?</subject>
<post author="rwatt451" timestamp="Feb 11, 2013 1:36 PM">
<s>hello, this is my first post here, i've searched around on a lot of old forums on this topic and most of the information relevant to it seems really outdated. 
i have an animation workflow that involves utilizing a lot of nested movieclip symbols to achieve relatively complex animtions.</s><s> ideally i'd like to be able to export my finished product into .avi or .mov for further tweaking in premiere or final cut, but so far i haven't been able to get these options to work the way i need them to. 
</s><s>exporting to .avi gives me a simplyfied version of my animation where none of the nested symbols play through. 
</s><s>i've read that if you export to quicktime it may work the way i'd like; however, i'm running windows and apparently you need quicktime installed a certain way for this option to work.</s><s> i installed the free version of quicktime 7 in hopes that would solve the exporting problem, but it hasn't.</s><s> i still receive the error message, "quicktime is not available.</s><s> please make sure quicktime is properly installed".</s><s> i feel like if i could get this working a lot of my problems would be solved. 
</s><s>other options i know about are...</s><s> 1. using a high quality screen capture application to record the .swf playing in adobe...</s><s> 2. finding some sort of conversion software that will convert my .swf file to an .avi or .mov. 
</s><s>so does anybody know how to fix the quicktime issue?</s><s> if not, any suggestions for the two types of software listed above?

<s>the best application i've found as far as converting .swf files into various video formats (.mp4 .avi .mov etc.</s><s>) is called moyea swf to video converter (it costs about $100).</s><s> there's a free trial so you can see if it suits your needs; although, it does throw a moyea watermark over the converted video.</s><s> it works quite well as far as i can tell and you don't get the frame dropping problem most people see when exporting to quicktime.

<s>hello all, 
</s><s>forgive me if i'm posting this in the wrong forum.</s><s> i'd like to know if what i'm proposing has been done before, and if so what some of the examples look like. 
</s><s>my idea is to embed clickable hotspots over a video.</s><s> for example, we have a shot of a truck rolling down the highway.</s><s> as it continues driving, different hotspots pop up over various parts of the truck, like axles, transmission, engines, etc. these hotspots can then be clickable, and a small tooltip/bubble pops up with a description about that part.</s><s> as the video continues playing, different hotspots continue to be generated and available. 
</s><s>i've been poking around all over the web looking for either examples or programs that enable the effect.</s><s> i've found that most "interactive videos" are based around two premises: shopping from within the video and pick your own storyline.</s><s> neither of which is necessarily what i'm looking for, so i've begun thinking that this might an after effects/flash based affair.</s><s> i can use after effects to generate the tooltips or 3d overlays of the various parts onto the original video, and use flash to generate the approriate interaction. 
</s><s>as this video will be web based, my final idea was to run the video underneath a layer of code that generated both the sprites and the effects.</s><s> the problem there is setting up the scripts so that they are timed perfectly with the video. 
</s><s>any thoughts?</s><s> if this isn't the place for this, could someone point out where i can get some insight?</s><s> much appreciated in advance!

</s><s>thought you might be interested in having a look at wirewax (www.wirewax.com).</s><s> we started out much like you creating overlays and doing tracking in after effects and then using flash to apply the interaction. 
wirewax has since developed into an online tool that allows anyone one from the most techy creative like yourself, to the basic youtuber, upload their own videos to the wirewax studio.</s><s> from there users can add their own tags to objects and people which are then tracked using our super intelligent tracking system ready for you to add your own overlays or choose from a range of widgets such as youtube and facebook.</s><s> the platform now uses much more advanced image processing to do things like face detection and motion tracking in real-time and works across mobile and tablet too. 
</s><s>ok, sales pitch over, please do have a go.</s><s> you can simply drop a video into the dropbox on the homepage and use the free tool to add interaction.</s><s> we also work with brands/producers/filmmakers to create customized experiences on a paid-for service. 
</s><s>here are a few examples of some videos you might find useful:

<subject>Synchronizing a Flash animation with Captivate</subject>
<post author="wiezzy1" timestamp="Nov 28, 2011 4:07 PM">
<s>hey, 
</s><s>does anyone know how to connect, or synchronize, an animation to a captivate cs5 timeline such that each frame of the animation is tied to a respective frame on the cp slide?</s><s> in other words, i want frame 1 of my animation to start on frame 1 of my cp slide (which it currently doesn't, regardless of where i put it on the cp timeline), and i would lilke the animation to pause and play according to what the cp slide is doing. 
</s><s>here's what i did: i made a slideshow animation in flash cs5 that i put in a cp slide on top of audio.</s><s> the animation lasts 35.5 seconds, same as the cp slide.</s><s> i put the animation at the beginning of the timeline, told it to play for the 'rest of slide', and checked 'sychronize with project' (which does nothing as far as i can tell).</s><s> i put a stop (); command at the end of the animation so it doesn't repeat (and that's literally the only code i have in there at this point).</s><s> the animation and the cp project are both at 30 frames per second. 
</s><s>here's what happens when previewing (f4ing) the project: when the project gets to that slide, the framework of the slide (audio/click boxes/buttons/etc) runs fine, but when the slide starts, it starts in the middle of the animation.</s><s> i.e., when the slide starts, frame 1 of the cp slide plays while frame (say...</s><s>) 75 of the animation plays.</s><s> the animation starts at a different place every time.</s><s> also, when i pause the slide, the animation keeps playing, which makes the problem worse.</s><s> i would like the animation to pause when the cp slide is paused. 
i know that animations generally act a certain way, but i would like to know if there is a way to change its behavior so that everything works together.</s><s> best-case scenario, there is an option somewhere that i'm overlooking, and worst-case, i would imagine that there is some way to write some actionscript into the flash animation that tells frame 1 to always be attached to cp's frame 1, and frame 2 to always to attached to cp's frame 2, etc, with every frame.</s><s> i'm new with actionscript, so i don't know how to do that. 
</s><s>any help would be greatly appreciated.</s><s> thanks.</s><s>

<post author="Jim%20Leichliter" timestamp="Dec 9, 2011 10:36 AM">
<s>hi brian, 
</s><s>after looking at your .fla file for the animation and doing some research, i've found the issue.</s><s> as rod ward correctly points out in this post: 
<quote>
<s>captivate 5 was a total rewrite from the captivate 4 software architecture and it introduced a subtle but fundamental change in the way that flash animations were handled in captivate published content. 
</s><s>basically the change means that if your animation was built down a level or two inside a symbol rather than on the main timeline at the top level, then you will find that captivate 5 or 5.5 loads and executes the animation on the first slide of the movie.</s><s> this means that by the time you get to the actual slide where you wanted the animation to perform it's magic, it's already run and finished. 
</s><s>in captivate 4 this did not happen.</s><s> the animation was not really loaded until later in the movie timeline so as to be ready for the slide where it was required.</s><s> it didn't matter if the animation was buried inside a symbol or not. 
</s><s>you have two choices: revamp your animation so that it all happens on the main timeline in the flash fla file that generates it.</s><s> get your flash programmer to add some actionscript code to the animation so that it does not play completely when first loaded at the beginning of the project at runtime. 
</s></quote>
</s><s>looking at your .fla file, i noticed you had a movieclip/symbol called "animations" that contained the time line but the main .fla movie's time line was pretty much empty.</s><s> following the logic of option 1, i moved all the layers from the "animations" time line to the .fla movie root time line and that fixed it.</s><s> in captivate, i also checked "synchronize with project" for the animation's properties and the animation did in fact pause and play when i paused and played the cp movie. 
</s><s>so bottom line is to make sure that you're using the main time line for any animation you're developing in flash professional. 
</s><s>hope that helps,

<s>you probably merged the vector layers and converted it to a bitmap by choosing sth like "solve conflicts/compatibility mode". tray this: copy some of your illustrator assets into your clipborad and insert the directly in after effects.</s><s> ae will then pop up a dialog, where you get to choose to "preserve your layers" (or sth. similar) choose this option and see if it solves your problem

<post author="908098989" timestamp="Oct 19, 2009 8:43 PM">
<s>****important: i would prefer if i can use the schematics in my manual, it would be too time consuming to redo all the schematics in a different program. the schematics are in pdf format but that can be change.</s><s> the manual has over 5000 schematics so re-designing them is out of the questions, i just want to add animation to them******** hello all, i am an aviation maintainer and are trying to make my job easier and need to add animation to electronic schematics.</s><s> what i need is a very interactive animations that show current flow, bulbs turning on, switches tripping, etc.</s><s> i also need to be able to control the sequence when these animations happen, for instance: been able to choose  from multiple switches, what switch will trip next, maybe have the switch as an object that activates an animation when clicked on, for instance a switch: when clicked on it moves the contacts to the on position and allows current flow, when click on again it moves the contacts to the off position and prevents current flow.the most important thing is that i should be able to decide what i want to animate, i am not looking for linear animation where you have to follow a strict sequence and can't deviate. there is a lot of components i have to work with and they turn on and off depending on the situation and that is why it need to be flexible.</s><s> the schematic below is very simple, i will be working with much more complex ones so it would be helpful if the animations where easy to update or change so that if i make a mistake on the beginning or if there is a small change to the schematic i don't have to redo everything ****schematic manual is in pdf format****** to make it easier to visualize here is a sequence of what i would like to it to look like.</s><s> 1- no power on.</s><s> 2- power is activated by clicking 28 vdc bus a bar (top left) 3- avionics power switch  (5025x) activates by clicking it.</s><s> 4- current flowing to next component.</s><s> 5- click avionics power switch (5025x) again and power is cut off. the simpler the program the better, however i am willing to learn how to use any programs (lynda.com is great for that), i have some programing knowledge too. the manual i work with is in pdf format so keep that in mind.</s><s> i guess i can change the format to some picture format but the manual is over 5000 pages long so that's a lot of pictures!</s><s> file size might be a lot, but if that is the only way or the best/easiest that's ok.                                i know that you can make some videos using images but they are not interactive enough.</s><s> thank you!</s><s>

<s>if you have really 5000 frames prepared in flash, good luck with that.</s><s> if you use any actionscript in your file you will have to export via: export>movie>quicktime.</s><s> make sure you check either stop export if last frame reached (only possible if you use no scenes) or after time (hh:mm:ss.ms) if you use any actionscript/multiplescenes then in quicktime options use the highest quality available (compression:animation>32bit) that will hopefully preserve your alphachannel.</s><s> if that works (quicktime export is not really a reliable thing in flash) then you can import the mov in after effects and finish compositing and exporting to flv there.
