<s>the u2410 is a wide gamut monitor, which not many have.</s><s> that has some special implications that you need to observe. 
</s><s>first some background: historically, all monitors had a native response that was very close to the srgb specification.</s><s> in fact, that's what the srgb specification is: a description of the behavior of an average monitor.</s><s> this means that an image prepared in srgb will display roughly correctly as it is. 
</s><s>but a wide gamut monitor is not close to srgb; it's close to adobe rgb.</s><s> not an exact match, just close.</s><s> so an srgb image will not display correctly; it will be very oversaturated because of the wider gamut. 
</s><s>color management takes care of all this by remapping the colors from one color space into another, preserving appearance.</s><s> it solves the whole problem - except many applications are not color managed at all.</s><s> but even if the application is color managed, like photoshop, it relies on a monitor profile to display correctly.</s><s> so you absolutely need to get a calibrator to make a monitor profile. 
</s><s>using the srgb preset will "dumb the monitor down" to conform to an average monitor.</s><s> but there's no particular reason to limit it this way, as long as you work in a color managed environment. 
</s><s>for web work you need a web browser that has full color management in all scenarios, which means firefox.</s><s> no other browser will display correctly on that monitor in all cases.</s><s> the problem is that a lot of material on the web does not have an embedded document profile, which is the other requirement for color management to operate.</s><s> you need a document profile and a monitor profile.</s><s> one is converted into the other.</s><s> with only one, it's like one hand clapping. 
</s><s>firefox can be set to work fully color managed even in the absence of an embedded profile.</s><s> it does this by assigning srgb for the missing profile.</s><s> thus the chain is back in operation.</s><s> unfortunately this has to be manually enabled (it should really have been the default).</s><s> to do this, type "about:config", without the quotes, in the address bar and hit go.</s><s> then scroll down to an entry called gfx.color_management.mode.</s><s> change it from 2 to 1. 
</s><s>in photoshop you can work in any color space you want, but srgb is a safe choice until you know more.</s><s> in any case, always convert to srgb for posting on the web. 
--- 
to sum up: a wide gamut monitor absolutely requires a fully color managed environment to work as intended.</s><s> that also means you must calibrate and profile it. 
</s><s>you can get around it by using the srgb preset, but then it's no longer a wide gamut monitor.

<s>hello,

</s><s>usually i use basiccolor display 5 and there are presets for both prepress and softproofing purposes.</s><s> both are based on significantly higher brightness values (120–160). 
</s><s>and that seems a lot more reasonable for me. 
</s><s>the swiss competence center ugra also recommends 120–160cd/m2.

<s>first let us consider a case of accurate color reproduction:   a painting is illuminated by flash, approximately 5000k.</s><s> an image is taken by a color-calibrated camera.</s><s> after the assignment of the camera profile the image is not further processed but printed by a calibrated printer.</s><s> the print is put aside the painting.</s><s> both look alike under d50 and under different  roomlight (in limits).</s><s> both together can be shot again – they will look alike in the image.</s><s> the whole process – camera calibration, image handling, printer calibration – is fully controlled by cie colorimetry.</s><s> inherent nonlinearities, like inverse gamma encoding, are compensated somewhere else in inverse order.</s><s> the process is linear.</s><s> the printing is not really linear, but there are definitely no corrections for perceptual appearance, because the viewing conditions are the same for the original painting and the reproduction.</s><s> cielab values are preserved or regenerated, e.g. by applying the camera profile.   in this example just a little more contrast had been added, not touching the automatic color correction: http://docs-hoffmann.de/camcal17122006.pdf see p.13.   if the viewing conditions are different, then the theories of color appearance models (mark fairchild and others) offer means how to modify an image for different types of illuminants, backgrounds, surrounds, etc. http://www.amazon.de/appearance-imaging-science-technology-fairchild/d p/b00ih7711o/ref=sr_1_1/277-9872972-1598965?s=books&ie=utf8&qid=139297 8327&sr=1-1&keywords=fairchild+color   second, let us consider the 'gamma question', traditionally in the context of tv with cathode ray tubes:   here i'm following mainly these books   r.w.g.hunt, the reproduction of colour (this not the same as measuring colour) http://www.amazon.de/reproduction-colour-imaging-science-technology/dp /0470024259/ref=sr_1_1/280-6435932-5887840?s=books-intl-de&ie=utf8&qid =1392977381&sr=1-1&keywords=hunt+reproduction+of+colour   giorgianni + madden, digital color management http://www.amazon.de/digital-color-management-encoding-solutions/dp/02 01634260/ref=sr_1_1/280-6435932-5887840?s=books-intl-de&ie=utf8&qid=13 92977326&sr=1-1&keywords=giorgianni+madden   and my own doc: http://docs-hoffmann.de/gamquest18102001.pdf    a scene photo is taken by a video camera.</s><s> a crt monitor has an overall transfer function between control voltage y and luminance z like z=y^g, with gamma g=2.8.</s><s> the camera signal y can be created from scene luminance x by y=x^(1/g)  which would result in an overall gamma of 1.0.</s><s> actually, tv monitors are not viewed in entirely dark rooms.</s><s> there is always some flare (stray light).</s><s> this requires an increased artificial contrast (a kind of early color appearance model correction, but mainly for luminance, though useful for better saturation in color tv as well).  finally we have y=x^(1/2.2)=x^0.4545 and z=y^2.8, which results in z=x^1.28 or so.   now we can see, that different viewing conditions require (theoretically) modifications  of  the image in order to create the same appearance.    brightness depends in a nonlinear fashion from object luminance and the background, see fig.1 here: http://www.google.de/imgres?imgurl=http://www.purveslab.net/img/lumina nce_fig_1.gif&imgrefurl=http://www.purveslab.net/research/explanation/ brightness/luminance.html&h=350&w=440&sz=26&tbnid=wwqocdedvsy20m:&tbnh =90&tbnw=113&zoom=1&usg=__sqe3dym_5_v9fuy_e3nzk-tnvie=&docid=d6tgzqz8r cb13m&hl=de&sa=x&ei=hwkgu9azcmtoygpyiigaba&ved=0cgyq9qewbjgk&dur=536 but these curves are not used for active correction.</s><s> just the same as the helmholtz-kohlrausch effect: vibrant red appears with 'exaggerated' brightness, but this happens in the scene and in the reproduction as well.</s><s> thus, corrections are not required,  as long as the color is in-gamut for all devices.   i hope this explanation will shed some light on this rather complex scientific area.</s><s> there is one (implicit) question not yet answered: under which conditions is luminance y a good correlate for brightness?</s><s> it would be necessary to read more about color appearance (e.g.</s><s> fairchild).   best regards --gernot hoffmann

<s>you're welcome, i have time enough and i like your questions – the same as i asked many years ago.   1.</s><s> gamma is not related with the human vision at all.   the nonlinear brightness-luminance function of vision is not the basic reason for gamma encoding.</s><s> there is just one objection remaining: the resolution in dark areas should be larger than in light areas.</s><s> this is true only if the eye is dark adapted, see test images p.17: http://docs-hoffmann.de/gamquest18102001.pdf then one should have more levels per luminance unit in the dark than in the bright.</s><s> if the source is in 8 bpc (bits per channel) then the application of y=x^(1/g) produces an overall loss of levels (184 instead of 256) and large gaps in y in the dark region, is therefore entirely useless.</s><s> aha – one needs a source with more bits, for instance 12, 14 or 16bpc.   2.</s><s> human being needs just the linear scene luminances for extracting the brightness information.</s><s> our eyes have already a gamma embedded in it for extracting the brightness values from the linear secene luminances, so we don't need any other artificial gamma.</s><s> that's my opinion too.</s><s> if we didn't have the phenomenon of 'brightness', then image processing would be just the same.   3.</s><s> we don't need, but in the past, the crt displays needed the gamma for linearizing the signal arriving to the crt displays.</s><s> yes, the first step is establishing linearity from scene view to display view.</s><s> the second step may be a correction because of the viewing conditions.   4.</s><s> today we need it for two reasons: one of them is backward compatibility and the other is our 8-bit image files.</s><s> as far as i know, lcds have approximately linear response, so if we start to use 32-bit floating point files as a new standard for image files in the future (poynton says even 16-bit files would be enough), we will not need gamma anymore.</s><s> at this point, we will have inherently linear systems for tone reproduction on our displays.</s><s> yes, my opinion as well.</s><s> this issue with banding in dark areas for 8bpc images may arise in synthetical images (gradients, computer graphics), but not in real-world photos.</s><s> some tests are here: http://docs-hoffmann.de/optigray06102001.pdf   an interesting discussion about brightness, lightness, gamma etc (year 2006): https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sci.engr.color/z95jl-oa6ce   please note, my old urls (as found in the internet) are no more valid, e.g.: http://www.fho-emden.de/~hoffmann/howww41a.html please replace by: http://docs-hoffmann.de/howww41a.html   there have been endless discussions about this 'gamma question' in the internet since about 15 years.</s><s> and it's still going on... http://photo.net/digital-darkroom-forum/00adn8   best regards --gernot hoffmann

</s><s>i've had a breakthrough.</s><s> the original/source image and the print settings box image now match, in both cs6 and pscc in mt.</s><s> lion, and the prints match what i see on my monitors.</s><s> there is a difference between the two monitors, but not much, and i only use the eizo for critical color correction and retouching. 

</s><s>here is what i did.</s><s> (monitor calibration done with a colormunki) 

1. calibrated my laptop monitor with the desktop/menu bar on my laptop, using the colormunki hardware & software. 

2. calibrated my eizo monitor with the desktop/menu bar on my laptop, using the colormunki hardware and the eizo software.</s><s> i tried the colormunki software but didn't like the results. 

3. before calibrating, (on both monitors) i dumped all previous calibration profiles that i made, and calibrated from the default factory calibration profile.</s><s> (i always keep two previous monitor profiles for comparison purposes so i can see what the changes are.</s><s> now i'm thinking i'll just delete them before recalibrating). 

4.</s><s> color settings in cs6 & pscc are set to adobe rgb 1998 (the same settings i've used since i started using photoshop).</s><s> image profile adobe rgb 1998.</s><s> (prophoto rgb also works). 

5. if i do the calibration of either monitor with the desktop/menu bar on the eizo monitor, the images do not match!</s><s> even after dumping all the calibration profiles i made and calibrating from the default factory calibration profile. 

6.</s><s> that all said, when i first started this process, the images didn't match on either monitor even when the desktop/menu bar was on the laptop.</s><s> the only difference i see is that i was calibrating from a previous profile that i made using the colormunki, not from the default factory profile.</s><s> maybe that's the issue.</s><s> it would be helpful to know if this is the case with other photographers who are having this problem. 

7.</s><s> i'm going to recommend this procedure to my friends who have the same problem, although, they are both using towers, not a laptop, with their eizo monitors.</s><s> one is running mt.</s><s> lion, and the other mavericks. 

i hope this helps.</s><s> i'm relieved and glad this is no longer an issue for me as i am entering my busy time which print making will be a big part of.</s><s> if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. 

</s><s>best,

<s>i openly confess to being a beginner (who is seriously trying to learn more) when it comes to color management so i ask you to please be kind. 
i am a photographer and i work mainly with stock photo agencies who offer images to photo users.</s><s> even though almost of the photo uses are for magazine and book publishers who use offset printers, stock agencies all require rgb files.</s><s> i recently discovered the "gamut warning" button in ps cs4 and it has changed the way i think about digital photography.</s><s> when the gamut warning is activated, virtually every photo that i take contains large amounts of out-of-gamut colors, especially in the yellow-green range.</s><s> if i were over-saturating or over-manipulating my images then i could understand it, but even photos straight out of the camera with no tweaking or correction of any kind have huge areas of unprintable colors.</s><s> i'm using pretty standard color settings in photoshop. 
</s><s>according to a popular book that deals with photoshop for photographers, the only way of dealing with this situation is to select> color range> out of gamut and then use hue/saturation to de-saturate the offending pixels until the gray gamut warning overlay disappears.</s><s> this is easy to do, but i have to de-saturate the image until the yellows-greens are almost gray.</s><s> the overall effect on the image is disastrous. 
</s><s>i've found that converting my rgb file to cmyk (using the relative colorimetric setting) and then back to rgb produces a much better looking image (only slightly unsaturated, but not objectionably so) but this seems like the wrong way to correct the situation and even though the resulting colors look smooth when viewed on my monitor at 100% i can't help but wonder if some sort of image degradation must occur.

<s>i would not throw in an extra conversion to cmyk and go back to rgb.</s><s> a few points to consider: 
1. there are many different cmyk color spaces.</s><s> some are much larger than others.</s><s> the gamut warning hinges on your proof setup cmyk space – if you are in u.s., this would default to us web coated swop v2.</s><s> just be certain that the cmyk is appropriate for your project (check with your printer).

<s>hi connie, 
</s><s>i read the forum thread link you posted.</s><s> on the surface it sounds like your images are appearing less saturated in color managed applications because their embedded profiles are being respected and converted from the embedded profile to the monitor space instead of having the rgb numbers in the images interpreted directly to the monitor space. 
</s><s>this could still potentially explain the issue for both a wide-gamut and a non-wide gamut monitor across different os's, although i would think it might be more pronounced on a wide-gamut monitor. 
</s><s>this could also occur in a situation where images are untagged. 
</s><s>could you tell me whether you're images are tagged or untagged, and if they are tagged what color profile they are being tagged with? 
</s><s>here's how you can tell whether something is tagged or not in photoshop (this is just one of a few different methods for finding this): 
1.</s><s> open your image.</s><s> 2. window > info, or hit the f8 key to open the info panel.</s><s> 3. click on the menu options button in the top right corner of the info panel (looks like a triangle pointing down with three horizontal lines next to it) and enter panel options...</s><s> 4. under the status information section, uncheck all of the boxes, and then only check on "document profile", hit [ok]. 
</s><s>the info panel should now give you a readout of what your current document's profile is (it should say something like "adobe rgb 1998" or "untagged rgb (8-bit)" or "srgb iec61966-2.1"). 
</s><s>please let me know what profile your images have (or if they are untagged) by using this method. 
</s><s>also, i've confirmed on my windows 7 machine that the "paint" program is a non-color managed application.</s><s> could you try opening an image in paint and comparing its appearance to photoshop? 
</s><s>thanks for your patience!</s><s> i can explain what icc color profiles are a little later, but i'd like to see first if this might be your issue, or at least confirm that it definitely isn't your issue.

<s>hmmm, 
</s><s>the calibrated profile is probably fine, you could verify this by just unchecking the "use my settings for this device" box in the windows color management dialog, then close the dialog and perform the same comparison tests you've been doing.</s><s> this will use whatever the windows default is ("default" meaning letting the os choose your monitor's profile instead of having you manually select another to use as the "default", windows color management wording is weird...</s><s>) 
</s><s>i just recently got an hp dreamcolor, another wide-gamut monitor, and i confirmed a similar behavior to what you're seeing by opening an untagged rgb image in photoshop and then going to edit > color settings and switching the color settings file (csf) from north american standard 2 to monitor color, i just kept the color settings dialog open with the preview checked on so i could see the color change switch on the fly. 
</s><s>what this test did was show me a comparison of the untagged image's rgb color values interpreted through srgb space (north american standard 2) vs. being interpreted directly by the monitor's color space (monitor color).</s><s> when interpreted directly through the monitor, the image's appearance was much more saturated in color. 
</s><s>if your final output is the web, then embedding srgb in your images is a safe bet (note that if you're using save for web, there are separate options to just convert the images to srgb and leave them untagged vs. converting to srgb and tagging them with srgb, so that color managed applications will know that the rgb numbers in your images are meant to be interpreted through the srgb color space.</s><s>) 
</s><s>color managment can be confusing, but you intuited the basics of it closely when you guessed that your images had some type of color "skin" attached to them.</s><s> this is basically what embedded profiles do, they create a meaning for the rgb numbers inside of your images, and allow color managed applications to detect what that meaning is and apply it properly for display. 
</s><s>rgb numbers are going to be displayed whether they have a specific meaning attached to them or not.</s><s> hence an untagged image will just have its rgb numbers interpreted directly through the monitor space, which means the interpretation of these image colors is proprietary, its appearance will be unique to the rgb output signals of the monitor, and will look different when those same rgb values are used through the output signal of a different monitor. 
</s><s>what non-color managed applications basically do is treat every image as untagged, because they can't read or understand the meaning that's embedded in them through the color profile. 
</s><s>since your final output is a web browser, your web browser would have to be a color managed browser to view images with embedded profiles correctly.</s><s> apple safari and the latest version of mozilla firefox both have color management and have it turned on by default.</s><s> internet explorer i believe is still unmanaged, and google chrome i'm not sure about. 
</s><s>if this is the correct behavior for what's happening with your setup, then a potential workaround would be to convert your final images in srgb and then tell your customers to use a color managed web browser to at least have a chance at viewing colors close to what you're seeing in photoshop (different monitors will still show variations still, but you'll have a much better chance with a color managed browser). 
srgb was traditionally associated with web images because monitors used to give a fairly close interpretation even if displayed through a non-color managed application.</s><s> maybe that's not the case anymore with newer monitors... 
</s><s>sorry for the length, but if this works, it will allow you to at least get your colors to a known state, so that if things still appear desaturated, but you know your customers will see the same thing, you'll be able to use color adjustments to give your images the look you want (there's other options, like using prophoto rgb instead of adobe rgb for your assigning profiles to your raw images, but that might require more explanation). 
</s><s>hope this helps!</s><s> if you have more questions feel free to ask, and if you think the issue is something different, i'd be curious to know and investigate this further.

<s>i don't think this behavior is part of your problem, but i can explain what you're seeing and it might help us move further along: 
when you view the metadata of raw (nef) image files in bridge, you'll see them displayed as "untagged" because raw files by their nature don't contain embedded color profiles.</s><s> when you open raw files in acr, the "adobe rgb" you're seeing at the bottom of the screen is what would be called the "working space", you can think of this as the way acr is taking the raw rgb values and interpreting them as some type of meaningful rgb numbers.</s><s> it's a little more complex than that, but in the end the colors you're seeing in your raw file in acr are adobe rgb color numbers, and when opened in photoshop the new image gets "tagged" with the adobe rgb color profile, so that photoshop will now understand that the rgb numbers that make up this image are adobe rgb numbers. 
</s><s>the way color managed adobe applications work is that they're always assigning a standardized "meaning" to the color numbers found in image files.</s><s> if an image has an embedded color profile, then photoshop will respect that meaning and use it to send those colors to the monitor display.</s><s> if the image is untagged (has no color profile) then the adobe application will assign it a meaning, and this meaning is called the "working space", which is also a color profile that is either temporarily assumed or permanently embedded (tagged) to the image when opened in the application. 
</s><s>this is the nature of color management, it only does two things: 1.</s><s> assign meaning to digital color numbers.</s><s> 2. convert that meaning to other color spaces so that the color appearance, barring technical limitations, can be more-or-less maintained across different spaces and devices. 
</s><s>if your workflow only consists of opening raw nef files in acr, editing them in photoshop, and then saving the output files for print/web/cd as jpegs with adobe rgb tagged on, then it sounds like your whole workflow is done in adobe rgb space.</s><s> this is fine for now.</s><s> what's important is that this shows that your color workflow is consistent and predictable.</s><s> this could also explain why adobe's tech support, after taking over your system, could not find the root of your problem, since they can only control the software side of things. 
</s><s>paradoxically, you mentioned that you can see the same behavior when using the same workflow on a different system.</s><s> this doesn't totally rule out a hardware issue, but it doesn't totally rule it in yet, either. 
i think the bridge forum thread you posted is headed in the right direction.</s><s> we need to understand your hardware's behavior, the os settings you're using, and get a slightly better understanding of your full workflow.</s><s> would you mind answering these further questions?: 
1.</s><s> the bridge thread mentioned your monitor can be set to different "modes" by pushing a button on the monitor.</s><s> could you tell me what mode you have selected when you profile the monitor, and if there are any settings you're allowed to choose inside of the spyder 3 elite profiling wizard, could you mention the choices you made (anything regarding gamma, color temperature, luminance level, etc...</s><s>)?</s><s> 
</s><s>2. would you mind attaching screenshots of your settings in the color management dialog inside of the windows control panel?</s><s> a screenshot of the devices tab and the advanced tab would be helpful.</s><s> if you've already posted these screenshots in a different thread, would you mind just providing the link to the thread? 
3.</s><s> after seeing these colors the way they are on your computer screen, have you tried viewing how these images look in their final output formats?</s><s> have tried viewing how the prints of these images look, and how they look after you upload them to your website and view them in a browser?</s><s> even though you don't like the colors the way you see them in photoshop right now, seeing whether this color appearance is consistently reproduced in your final outputs could be a key factor in determining the solution to your issue.</s><s> please give this a try if you haven't already.

<s>hi connie,   let me resume:   non  colormanaged applications (like windows explorer) shows your images  right, managed apps like lr and bridge, which have different  cache folders, shows them desaturated, even the previewed nef.</s><s> putting this  together, it can't a problem with the cache, harddisk, cf card.</s><s> i mean, a  cache is a cache, and might needed to be updated from time to time, f.e.  when changing the monitor- or image profile.</s><s> but i expect you always have done this.   that's it - most of the rest (the tests done) provides unreliable information, sorry.</s><s> i'm aware that to most of them you were forced by others, so don't take my following statements to personal.   nevertheless i believe what we see partitial is right: some of your images  are untagged (at least the psd we see in one of the screenshots in here) untagged images should look the same  in ie and firefox unless you set gfx.color management.mode to 1 and assign the monitor profile to ff.</s><s> per default cm in ff is enabled for tagged images only and by this acts like ie <v9 on untagged images untagged srgb should look oversaturated on wide-gamut monitors and browsers on which you can't apply a profile.</s><s> believe that is what you get.     you asked me i'm confused which photos you viewed of mine that you found to be untagged?</s><s> all the images you presented in threads in here are untagged ;-) some might think different about that, but imho images always should have an embedded profile, even srgb jpegs used for web.</s><s> you already get some hints on that in the other thread and the links to ballard - even when his webdesign is a bit odd, its worth reading.   i believe your issue is a combination of untagged images, a faulty monitor profile and maybe false handling.   as implied above, personaly i can't trust any of the tests here, because they are (including the browser test i mentioned) not consistant done - i will tell you why.</s><s> what you see next are three of the images you provided here, but stacked:   #1 (rgb/8*)* here the second * indicates, that the image was altered (either bei assigning a colorspace or bei normal editing) after it was loaded and in a colorspace which is different from photoshops working colorspace, which is indicated by the first * #2 (rgb/8*) indicates images colorspace is different from photoshops working colorspace - that's fine when the working space is argb and the image f.e. srgb #3 (rgb/8) no *, no # in here indicates it is in photoshops working colorspace.   (rgb/8#) at the top would mean it is untagged, but when when colormanagement was off in that moment, it also would read as (rgb/8) or (rgb/16) (without an # or *) at the top, but "untagged" in the info panel at the bottom, even when the image has an embedded profile...   on the otherhand - and this is the important part - the photoshop (import) settings you provided here, tells that your ps is at "preserve embedded profiles" but "ask when opening" at profile mismatches.</s><s> by this you will be asked whenever an image profile mismatches the working colorspace.</s><s> the latter should be unchecked, anyway.   so what have you been doing, when you were asked for image #1 and #2?</s><s> with this settings and since their colorprofiles are different from ps working space, you must have been asked and have assigned a profile different from working space or you haven't been asked (because images colorspace and the working space was the same) and you assigned a different profile initially later.   or you have changed settings again and again when taking those screenshots....</s><s> when you say you see images as untagged in bridge but in photoshops info panel as "adobe rgb (1998)" this can be, when a profile was added (assigned) after the image was imported to ps. bridge will not know about that until you save the image.   will say: those of us trying to help, never know exactly what they are here looking at (maybe without realizing) do we see a srgb under an argb working space (rgb/8*) for #2?</s><s> and #3, is this an argb image under an argb working space or a srgb image under srgb, (both would appear as rgb/8)?</s><s> or was the image untagged and colormanagement was off?   seems a bit chaotic, sorry.</s><s> at least this is nothing on which i'ld be able to tell for sure what is going on.   next: the monitor  profile you sent to me, turns my u2410 dark and too much purple/reddish.</s><s> of  course there should be a differences (different monitor, different  environment light and my old eyes), but this is far to much - it hurt my eyes   as  far i know, lr internal uses the melissa color space (which is larger  than argb)  - i wonder what happens when raw were processed via meliassa  to argb with a too reddish monitor profile and are saved as untagged  argb....</s><s>?</s><s> i also wonder how lr can be configured to export to psd without  they being tagged...</s><s>?   nevertheless, i was able to reproduce this once.</s><s> for one of my psds the profile was removed, but at the moment i don't know how to reproduce that again.   as said just make sure you images are tagged.</s><s> but don't just apply a profile to those images already processed, when you don't know what really happend to them - it might get worse.   anyway.</s><s> to solve your prob, you should forget about lr for  now and remove the monitor profile made with the spyder, set the dell  profile which comes with the cd and process images from scratch.</s><s> means  straight from nef in one colorspace only -> via photoshops acr (output as argb and make sure argb is your  working space in ps), save them as psd or tiff and make sure they get tagged as argb.</s><s> see if it makes a difference (color shift or not), when viewed  in bridge.   if there is no shift, start over with calibrating your monitor.</s><s> calibrating means setting the hardware right, by making sure the monitor was set to argb and brightness and contrast was adjusted, before you profilling it with the spyder.   if the problem still exists with this new profile and with images, which were processed by the above workflow and by the new conditions (make sure of that, the already processed images might be messed up) again let some one with an u2410 check the new profile.</s><s> if its still have a huge red shift on another u2410, it might point to a hardware fault (either monitor or spyder)   @mjorts   i notice that "use windows display calibration" is checked on in your screenshot.  afaik this setting means, that windows is loading the lut and not a third-party lut-loader, coming with the profiling device.   message was edited by: ablichter #1 (rgb/8*)* was edited - wasn't able to mark the wrong part by formating it <s>"striked"</s>, so i removed and corrected it

<s>sorry i was on vacation for a few days...

i wouldn't trust the print output from walmart as far as color management goes.</s><s> i don't know what their print workflow looks like, but if they're like most photo stores they'll make some basic color adjustments to every individual file they print, which usually means any pics with people in them get warmed up through color adjustments before printing. 
</s><s>like ablichter mentioned, firefox should respect embedded color profiles.</s><s> are you positive that the picture opened through firefox contains an embedded adobe rgb profile?</s><s> as opposed to testing the website itself through the browser, i would open the original image, that you can confirm has the embedded profile, and then right click it to open it into firefox, and do the same comparison with explorer (version 8 or earlier).</s><s> the ballard web links should confirm each browser's color management behavior, too.</s><s> he even uses adobe rgb tagged images on his website to demonstrate. 
</s><s>the picture of the website you showed, have you tried viewing the website on a different monitor?</s><s> how does the appearance compare? 
</s><s>even though your test results so far are a little confusing, i still believe this is expected behavior, where your wide gamut monitor is just oversaturating images that look normal under color managed applications.</s><s> i own a wide gamut monitor and can reproduce the effect you're getting by opening an argb tagged image in ie8 and seeing that its far more saturated than the same image opened in firefox, safari, or photoshop since they can read and respect the embedded profile without sending the color numbers straight to the monitor. 
</s><s>the other reason i don't think it's an adobe bug is because i haven't heard of any complaints like this from other users.</s><s> i've seen other forum posts with complaints of a similar nature, but they draw the same conclusion that i'm coming to. 
</s><s>could you try out my two suggestions and see what happens?</s><s> i don't think it's a monitor calibration issue because the adobe and browser apps still have to go through the monitor, and at least in your screenshots they look normal enough.

<s>thanks for the info on windows lut loaders.</s><s> it's nice that they give such easy, intuitive controls over os color management, since color management itself is already so abundantly easy to understand... 
</s><s>thank you for providing more info on connie's issue, too.</s><s> maybe if we eliminate more variables we can figure it out.</s><s> i have a vested interest in solving this problem too, mostly out of curiosity and a better understanding of how the color management eco system is working in this situation.</s><s> i'm a new-hire quality engineer (assigned to color management) on the photoshop team, so i'm trying to learn as much as i can by working on weird problems like this . 
</s><s>perhaps we could stick with this one image for now, for testing purposes?</s><s> could you tell me what version of bridge/photoshop you guys are using?</s><s> if the desaturated appearance also appears in photoshop, would you mind if we isolated the testing to photoshop for now?</s><s> i'm not as familiar with bridge, and i suspect that the embedded profile not being displayed in bridge is a potential bug (i can at least verify this behavior by using my own psd files, bridge seems to not display the metadata profile name when the psd reaches a certain file size...</s><s> i haven't checked with the bridge team yet to see if this is a bug though). 
</s><s>i'm checking to see if i can find a copy of this u2410 monitor on floor so i can reproduce this behavior.</s><s> i have an hp dreamcolor wide gamut monitor right now, so i'm working with that to try and reproduce the situation. 
</s><s>the behavior i mentioned that you quoted above i can also reproduce with an srgb embedded image (in fact i was using an srgb image and mistakenly thought it was embedded with argb, oops...</s><s>) but if a tagged image is looking the same in ie as in ff, but different in bridge/photoshop, it sounds like something else is happening... 
</s><s>would you mind sharing the version numbers of your ie and ff?</s><s> i heard the older versions of ff had cm turned off by default, but the newer versions have it turned on by default.</s><s> i'm using ie8 right now and ff 3.5.13. 
</s><s>if you feel like it you could download the windows version of apple safari browser and try that one, too.</s><s> that browser always has cm turned on, and on my machine i'm getting identical results to ff but ie8 is behaving as though it's not respecting the profile (expected). 
</s><s>does the u2410 have different "modes" that you can set in the monitor menu, and then assign the corresponding manufacturer provided profile in windows color management?</s><s> i tried this with my hp dreamcolor, setting its mode manually to srgb, and then changing the monitor profile wcm to match it as srgb, and then the colors on all applications match (ie8, ff, safari, and photoshop).</s><s> could you try something like that? 
</s><s>my theory is that the desaturated colors are the "right" colors, and that the monitor just displays a wider gamut with much more saturated colors than the color spaces typically embedded in images (srgb, argb).</s><s> since you have the same monitor though, it sounds like this might not explain it, but just comparing screenshots i don't think will answer the problem since screenshots in windows are untagged (if they're just capturing the raw color numbers coming out of the monitor, then a screenshot passed between one u2410 to another could still look different from each other, and it wouldn't prove that the bridge/photoshop colors are wrong).</s><s> or, if you paste a screenshot into a blank, new document srgb image in photoshop, the image inside of the color managed app will appear desaturated and the image in non-managed app will appear normal. 
</s><s>would you mind letting me know about the color modes settings for the u2410 and make sure you and connie are using the same mode settings, along with the same windows cm monitor profile and as close to identical windows cm settings as you can both get to? 
</s><s>another test would be for connie to open the desaturated looking image in photoshop, edit it until she gets the color appearance she likes (without changing the embedded profile of the image) and then saving and sending it to you to see if the image looks correct to you in the photoshop on your computer.

<s>hi, even when connie answers some points already, let my add some more.   whether bridge or ps, its the same on both.</s><s> i made sure the seetings are okay, so no sideeffects can happend here.</s><s> so when i mentioned bridge than because it was used for a quick view to the images.</s><s> and i purged its cache when important things in the system were changed.     connie uses cs5, acr 6.2, bridge 4.0.3.</s><s> 9 - as said all the latest, because we updated.</s><s> my setup is a bit different since i use acr and dng converter 6.3 beta, but this does not matter here.   profile was the default,  which comes with the cd and systems "viewing conditions profile" is "wcs  profile for icc viewing conditions" as it should be, when you don't use  ms's internal cm.</s><s> ms's internal cm and "wcs profile for  srgb viewing conditions" refers to the *.cdmp file "in  c:\windows\system32\spool\drivers\color" which f.e. appears as "srgb  virtual device model profile" in the wcs dialog.   connie  uses ie 8 - ff i didn't checked, but as told in another post, i  need to corrected the cm settings to 1 (gfx.color_management.mode) for enabling cm for any rendered image and it  behaves as it should.</s><s> i use colormanaged ie9 beta and ff 3.6.12 with the same settings.</s><s> we verified settings and browsers viewing conditions with this site, especially the 2nd page.</s><s> her ie still is color stupid (explained at the 3rd page) ff "color smart" ;-)   but the webbrowsers are imho not the point here.</s><s> does the u2410 have different "modes" that you can set in the monitor menu, and then assign the corresponding manufacturer provided profile in windows color management?  i tried this with my hp dreamcolor, setting its mode manually to srgb, and then changing the monitor profile wcm to match it as srgb, and then the colors on all applications match (ie8, ff, safari, and photoshop).  could you try something like that?</s><s> yes, the monitor has, thought hers was set to argb, but it seems its on  standard.</s><s> but except with srgb this settings just changes the color temperature -  argb usually is  warmer.   this doesn't proof a thing, because the color of the images matches in both browsers and explorer ;-) there was a bit difference  maybe, because ie doesn't read the embedded profile and ff makes use of rendering intents.   the prob  appears, when a colormanged app comes into game.</s><s> (i forgot to point ff to the monitor profile, i used srgb instead :-(, but the above test was passed) i won't say its with adobe products, but of course we concentrated to them.   @connie not sure if i saw fastpicture viewer or if it was another product on  your computer the other day.</s><s> can you please download it from here and set it to use the dells generic monitor profile in menu =>  options.</s><s> please check if the images are desaturated in there as well and report.</s><s> should  be, because its cmed.</s><s> my theory is that the desaturated colors are the "right" colors, and that the monitor just displays a wider gamut with much more saturated colors than the color spaces typically embedded in images (srgb, argb).</s><s> like connie i have to disagree too.</s><s> images looked okay before booting.</s><s> and right before bridge applies its color corrections to them, they look okay too.   regarding this: since you have the same monitor though, it sounds like this might not explain it, but just comparing screenshots i don't think will answer the problem since screenshots in windows are untagged (if they're just capturing the raw color numbers coming out of the monitor, then a  screenshot passed between one u2410 to another could still look different from each other, and it wouldn't prove that the  bridge/photoshop colors are wrong).  or, if you paste a screenshot into a blank, new document srgb image in photoshop, the image inside of the color managed app will appear desaturated and the image in non-managed app will appear normal   let me resume: my argb embedded image looked  desaturated with her bridge or photoshop.</s><s> i was able to see that even in a remote  session.</s><s> i took a screenshot by what i saw on my computer.</s><s> i viewed my image in bridge on my computer and took a screenshot.</s><s> i opened both in cs5, converted them to srgb - appearances stayed the same.</s><s> i pasted them into one image, saved that as embedded srgb and uploaded it here.</s><s> note that i compared two screenshots and not a screenshot with the my original image... if they're just capturing the raw color numbers coming out of the monitor   yepp, but what was captured is the already interpreted/processed data, poiting to the color numbers of the monitor(s) - will say  we captured the endproduct = what is shown to the user.</s><s> i believe its acceptable to compare this way.</s><s> correct me if my idea is wrong, but please explain it a bit more indeep.   of course i can't say if connie saw the same like me, since i was on a remote session, but i believe she would have intervened or corrected me, when what i presented looked to different to what she saw.   in my former post there was a mistake ( will correct that after sending this, not sure if i can mark it noticeable as edited because striking often does not work when editing an already posted reply).</s><s> seems i'm not able to correct a former post anymore, after there was a reply.   i said the image in question had srgb embedded, but it has argb and looked desaturated on her ps/bridge. srgb are almost fine.</s><s> her system is performing diametral to how it should.</s><s> let me again take the old example: its like viewing an argb or prophoto image with <ie8.   what i don't know: is there a need for a gamut-mapping when images colorspace is the same as the working and monitor space?</s><s> or does it always happend?   @all - thanks for your help, but please don't concentrate to much to an adobe update.</s><s> as connie reported in one of her former posts, she has this with other cm apps too, not only ps, lr or bridge.   btw: does somebody know, why there is a © in front of the filename and colorspace for the image i mentioned in the other thread?</s><s> i can do what i want, i can't get rid of it and i also don't find something poiting to © in exif, iptc or xmp.

<s>dot gain refers to offset printing, where halftone dots increase in size because ink is spreading when it hits the paper.</s><s> it depends on paper stock, and is accounted for in a cmyk profile.</s><s> so you could look at dot gain as the grayscale equivalent of cmyk. 
(incidentally, if you want true grayscale on press - only the black plate - you can set gray working space to "black ink - <cmyk profile>".</s><s> you do this in the gray working space pulldown, "load gray", and just pick the cmyk profile). 
</s><s>an inkjet printer expects rgb data.</s><s> so even if you submit a grayscale image, it will probably be converted to rgb somewhere.</s><s> in that case it seems better to use gamma 2.2. 
</s><s>if you just have a b & w adjustment layer, you have an rgb file (just with r=g=b) and that's the setting that applies.</s><s> gray working space or dot gain doesn't apply and it has no bearing on what you see on screen or how it will print. 
</s><s>however, and here's an important point: if you display a single channel in an rgb image (click on a single channel in the channels panel) - that will be displayed according to your chosen gray working space.</s><s> in effect, your working gray will be assigned to it.

<s>for web, email and screen in general it should always be srgb.</s><s> then you can be fairly certain that it will display correctly (more or less) in any scenario. srgb wil also work for print (inkjet), it's just that many colors that can be printed are out of srgb gamut, so it's a restriction that doesn't need to be there. srgb is a small color space that can't reproduce very saturated colors - they're just clipped.</s><s> so it's better to start with a larger space like adobe rgb or even prophoto. 
</s><s>for editing purposes you want a large color space simply to have headroom and not hit the wall at every move.</s><s> the final destination may well be a smaller space, like a printer profile.</s><s> the software then converts to that destination profile as it goes to the printer.</s><s> you can soft proof to the printer profile to get an impression of how the final result will look. 
</s><s>you can print directly from indesign, but the typical indesign workflow is to export a finished pdf.</s><s> that is where you specify a final destination profile for the whole document, whether a certain cmyk profile for offset press, or an rgb profile for screen.</s><s> so you have your master indesign file, and output pdfs for each destination.</s><s> the indesign file can contain placed rgb images in any color space, while text and graphic elements are cmyk.</s><s> then everything is converted in one go at export. 
</s><s>you should always go through the pdf export dialog carefully.</s><s> use the presets, but don't automatically accept defaults.</s><s> for specific purposes, ask here or in the indesign forum, where they deal with this all the time. 
</s><s>for screen, under "output" use convert to destination, srgb, include profile.</s><s> under "compression", things aren't as obvious as they used to be (downsample to 96 or 100 ppi), because of the new retina displays that can benefit from a higher resolution.</s><s> i hold my judgement on this one.

<s>in addition to john's useful comments: 
using pantone 512u (uncoated) isn't correct for coated fogra. 
</s><s>why can one spot color convert into two different cmyk sets if converted by the user? 
</s><s>assumed, the one spot color is uniquely defined by one lab set: – the cmyk spaces are different – the cmyk spaces are the same but the rendering intents are different – the cmyk spaces are the same but the black point compensations are different (on or off for relative colorimetric). 
</s><s>assumed, the spot colors are equal by name, but valid for different versions, both in lab: – this obviousl at present the most common source of deviations. 
</s><s>assumed, the spot colors are defined by cmyk: – a chaotic situation which i wouldn't even like to dicuss. – cmyk to cmyk conversions should be avoided under all circumstances. 
</s><s>the solutions: 
if the spot color will be printed always and everywhere by pantone spot ink: – purchase an actual pantone color fan und discuss with the printer the mixture for the selected ink. 
</s><s>if the pantone color is merely a design feature, but the doc will be printed by cmyk: – choose such a color and verify by soft proofing that the color is in-gamut for common cmyk spaces. – read the lab values and proceed as far as possible using lab. – don't use ink names, don't use any reference to pantone. – convert into to a specificic cmyk space in advance to the generation of the specific pdf.

</s><s>if you want to get onyx rip to print the same color from cs5 and cs6, you have to set all pantone colors as spot and not cmyk.</s><s> then, onyx will receive the same pantone name and will do the conversion with its own pantone color table. 
</s><s>the problem you have is because your pantone color are set as process cmyk and not spot color.</s><s> i agree that cmyk values between cs5 and cs6 are not the same.</s><s> this is beacause of the way pantone libraries are defined.</s><s> in cs5, the default color mode of color book is cmyk and in cs6, the default color mode of color book is lab.</s><s> you have to understand that in cs6, pantone are better simulated (as default) from start because it is using lab value.</s><s> in cs5, the pantone silmulation was not true, unless you were selecting "overprint preview" in the view menu.</s><s> this was the way to tell illustrator to use the internal lab value for pantone dispaly. 
</s><s>secondly, if you have to set your pantone in process cmyk mode, make sure that the default cmyk working space is the same as the one you are using as default in your onyx rip.</s><s> this will help to keep consistency between illustrator and the rip.

<s>the indigo uses a production flow rip, it does not use a pantone lookup table.</s><s> one of the problems with a paneone lookup table is that over the past 10 years, paneone has modified their cmyk builds at lease 3 times...</s><s> us being a commercial printer for a wide variety of clients, accept files that use builds from older pantone books as well as the newer ones. 
i print cmyk becasue each of the previous pantone books had thier own cmyk builds associated to it and in order to match customer expectations and samples, we don't adjust the cmyk values... if you use a lookup table, you're at the mercy of whichever version the lookup table uses.

<s>hi guys, 
</s><s>i've read through this whole forum and i have found a solution to everyones problem.</s><s> it is a work around but will save everyone alot of time and hassle and so far it hasn't let me down. 
</s><s>first step: following the instructions as per the adobe page http://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/kb/pantone-plus.htm for replacing the colour books.</s><s> make sure you follow all of the instructions for defaulting the setting in illustrator cs6 to use only cmyk breakdowns (this is very very important) this will fix your problem in illustrator however you will still notice that importing any artwork into indesign, the pantone colours will still load as lab versions (despite having deleted the pantone+ swatches from your library) 
</s><s>note: you will find that if you load old artwork files it will load your desired cmyk versions of any pantones correctly.</s><s> however when you add new swatches it loads these as lab breakdowns.</s><s> which is what we all want to go away to provide consistency with previous clients.</s><s> 
</s><s>important info: once a correct cmyk verions of a pantone has be imported into an indesign document you cannot load the same pantone reference colour again.</s><s> meanding it is impossible to have a pantone 282 c (cmyk) and pantone 282 c (lab)... only one colour profile can be in a document.</s><s> so basically if you pre-load all of the pantones as cmyk, indesign is prohibited from stupidly loading lab values of pantones swatches: 
so..... 
</s><s>step two: (ensuring you have defaulted illustrator in step1 correctly as per instructions from adobe)... open illutrator cs6.</s><s> create a new document.</s><s> click your swatches tab and clear it of all swatches so it is empty.</s><s> click open swatch library. click colour books.</s><s> navigate to the swatch library you require, (for me a mainly use pantone solid coated) not pantone+ ) however since you have followed the steps in step 1 these will not appear in your list as you have deleted all of the pantone + library.</s><s> ( you can repeat this for as many colour books as required.</s><s> when the swatched table opens, click the first swatch colour, hold shift key and the click the very last swatch colour and drag these into your swatch panel.</s><s> your will now have the complete colour book all defined as pantone/spot colour/ with a correct(traditional) cmyk value.</s><s> now go to "save swatch library as ase..."within the swatch dropdown menu.</s><s> and save this somewhere permanent. 
</s><s>step three: open indesign cs6.</s><s> do not open a document.</s><s> go to your swatches tab.</s><s> click 'load swatches' and open your saved ase file you made in illustraor cs6.</s><s> this will now load the full pantone colour library into your swatches tab.</s><s> remember as we said before that indesign will not allow you to open two versions of the same pnatone reference, so no matter what file you open, as long as it has a pantone reference, lab or cmyk versions, because they are now already loaded into the swatch library, indesign will force the conversion to only be cmyk values of your required pantone references and it will not default to lab values for pantone colours. 
</s><s>if required.</s><s> when you have finished your artwork, select, "select all unused" and then delete the ones you don't need. 
</s><s>warning: if you delete anything you have imported into your swatch library from your created ase file... i.e.</s><s> pantone 282c.... when you manually add it back again inside indesign it will default back to the undesired lab breakdown of the pantone. 
</s><s>hopefully this cures a few headaches, so you can all get back to work and enjoy what are some great benefits of using cs6 versions. 
</s><s>on my final note, i do understand why adobe is trying to force this change.</s><s> it is an improvement.</s><s> however it does require that everyone in your company follows suit, it also requires that you explain this to each of your clients and it does mean changing colours and work flows, which is a decision of individual companies not the decision of adobe to make it for you, which i think is a bad move on there part to try and force this change.

<s>i've read through this entire post and if anyone has to go through this much effort to maintain color consistancy after an application upgrade then it's pretty pretentious for adobe or pantone to want us to use their products.</s><s> it is a matter of opinion as to whether lab manages colors better than spot or cmyk, that is up to the user workflow and the options should have been left open, or (and maybe i missed it) adobe could have announced pantone was changing its library color build.</s><s> either way it is a huge burden on the users that support these products.</s><s> at any rate...</s><s> i immedietely noticed the change in the cmyk build in the pantone libraries from cs5 to cs6, and even though my rip is set up to manage the final output for select spot colors my print operators noticed the color variation on their screen and began qc'ing all the art.</s><s> the only way i've found to fix it is to go into the swatch library and manually change the spot colors back to the original build.</s><s> this will default an error on pre-flight but as long as you know you've creating the error you can just ignore it.</s><s> sure your rip can catch the color and convert it to the correct usable workspace.</s><s> but anyone in this business knows how much time it take to color calibrate these machines and expecting anyone has the time to do this in the middle of running a print business hasn't spent enough time on the ground to understand that's just stupid.</s><s> i don't want to have to set up a beta workstation to test adobe products for potential workflow errors on future version releases, but thats better than shutting down a print facility and wasting material trying to catch up to something that probably didn't need changed...just saying.

<s>first of all you need to establish whether you have a fully color managed pipeline from source to monitor.</s><s> that is absolutely essential with a wide gamut monitor such as the dell u2410. 
</s><s>there is an important distinction here between calibrating and profiling a display.</s><s> calibration is a basic modification of the display itself, setting white point luminance and temperature, gamma and neutral color balance.</s><s> calibration affects everything globally, but is not part of the color management chain (except indirectly). 
</s><s>profiling the display introduces color management.</s><s> the profile is a complete and detailed description of the display in its calibrated state.</s><s> included in that description is the precise position, in three-dimensional color space, of the three primary colors. 
</s><s>in a color managed process, the source profile is converted on the fly to the destination profile, in this case the monitor profile.</s><s> all the source colors are remapped into the destination (monitor) color space, according to the profile description. 
</s><s>this has two important implications relating to your question.</s><s> one, it doesn't matter what gamma the monitor is calibrated to - it's remapped from source gamma to monitor gamma whatever it is.</s><s> monitor gamma matters only in a non-color managed situation, because then there's no such remapping.</s><s> you just want a gamma target that makes the monitor behave at it's best, which is usually native. 
</s><s>two, only the monitor profile can account for gamut differences.</s><s> again the operative word is remapping.</s><s> calibration alone can not define a gamut.</s><s> the only way to do that without full color management is to set it in the monitor itself, if it has that option. 
</s><s>in this context rec.709 is equivalent to srgb.</s><s> the primaries and the white point are the same.</s><s> gamma (tone response curve) is different, 2.4 vs 2.2, but that is irrelevant in a color managed workflow.</s><s> and with that monitor, you absolutely need a fully color managed environment for the gamut remapping, since rec.709 has srgb primaries.</s><s> the monitor otoh has adobe rgb primaries (or close to it) - unless you use the srgb preset on the monitor.

<s>i was probably trying to assess where you were at in terms of what your jobs required and what you were used to and capable of doing.</s><s> this is all good to know. 
</s><s>whenever you convert digital color from one color space to another, and it can be from rgb to cmyk, rgb to rgb, rgb to lab, cmyk to cmyk, cmyk to rgb, etcetera, there are different ways of applying the conversions.</s><s> photoshop allows you to use four different "rendering intents".</s><s> they are relative colorimetric, perceptual, absolute colorimetric, and saturation.</s><s> the two most common are the two i mentioned - relative and perceptual.</s><s> the biggest difference between the two is what happens to really bright, saturated colors when you convert from one space to another.</s><s> you can read up on that online more quickly than i can write about it here, but the difference can be substantial with some images and inconsequential with others - usually in whether there is detail in saturated colors or whether it all turns to one solid blob of color. 
</s><s>being a commercial photographer in los angeles who also does a lot of high end prepress work for a variety of clients, and sees a lot of work from all sorts of photographers, i would say that most, including some very well known ones, have little idea of how to color correct, and that images provided by photographer can almost always be made substantially better.</s><s> it's easy to think you know how to do it right until someone sits down with one of your images and shows you otherwise.</s><s> i could tell you a hundred stories- 
everyone comes from there own perspective, and mine has always been to make the images i'm working on, whether they're mine or someone else's, print they best regardless of the type of printing - from inkjet to offset.</s><s> i take an individual approach and fine tune each image for each catalogue, brochure, cd package or large print to be it's best.</s><s> but i also realize that not everything needs this treatment and not all clients can tell the difference anyway.</s><s> and then there's always the time vs. money factor.

<s>what could help: -synchronize all application to the same color settings (be sure to select the proper color settings first -> 'europe prepress 3' if you're located in the eu for instance) - keep your images in rgb - place the rgb images in indesign - export to pdf using proper pdf export settings (pdf/x-1a if it has to flattened (pdf1.3), pdf/x-4 if you want to keep live transparency) - never forget to 'live preflight' your document before converting it to pdf or sending it to your print service provider btw :-): http://www.vigc.org/standard-preflight-profiles/ 
this approach assumes of course that you are content with the standard icc based color conversion that indesign will do for you during pdf conversion (similar to the color conversions you did in photoshop) and that no manual tweaking of images is required to achieve better image quality afterwards.
