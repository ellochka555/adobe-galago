<s>a few years ago, i really and truly relied on adobe software to get my web design and development done.</s><s> i was able to slice up a massive image that i had created and them jump into adobe dreamweaver to make the required code changes.</s><s> once i learnt how, i would then go into adobe flash and add cool new features such as the old logos that can rotate etc.

<s>first, let's get our terms clarified.   mobile apps -- these are widgets that people download to their mobile device.  these apps are created specifically to run on an android or ios or blackberry, etc...</s><s> apps typically have nothing to do with the company's web site.  apps range from updates on traffic/weather, tracking your health/fitness, productivity, entertainment, weight loss/dieting, games, gps, you name it, it's probably out there...  see google play store https://play.google.com/store/apps   jquery mobile is often used to build the mobile app while phonegap is used to compile the app for the specific devices and then upload it to a distribution site like google play or apple's app store.   see create & package mobile app with dw, jquery mobile & phonegap http://www.adobe.com/devnet/dreamweaver/articles/dw-phonegap-mobile-ap p.html   mobile web site development -- this is another discipline.  web sites that perform well on desktops, laptops, tablets and mobile devices are called responsive.  adobe has several ways to help web designers create responsive web sites.   edge reflow dreamweaver's fluidgrid layouts muse responsive designs business catalyst's mobile friendly templates.   in addition, there are 3rd party extensions & frameworks you can use in dw to jump start your responsive web designs.   dmx zone's free bootstrap extension for dw http://www.dmxzone.com/go/21759/dmxzone-bootstrap/ project seven's page packs (commercial responsive templates) http://www.projectseven.com/products/templates/index.htm foundation zurb http://foundation.zurb.com/templates.php skeleton boilerplate http://www.getskeleton.com/ initializr (html5 boilerplate, responsive or bootstrap) http://www.initializr.com/   all that said, if i were building a wordpress site, i would definitely use a commercial  responsive theme as my starting point.  there's no sense in re-inventing the wheel.     nancy o.

<s>hi.</s><s> hope this is right forum.</s><s> first post.</s><s> a brief background.</s><s> years ago (2007-2008) i created a web portfolio for school.</s><s> first it was in html (dreamweaver) and then flash.</s><s> i hadn't really touched it in years and decided this past couple of months, after playing in the medium again, to get back into wed design, 3d, and digital content creation.</s><s> that said, i went in and updated both the html and flash versions with the knowledge i currently have, limited though it is.</s><s> i now would like to go forward and build a completely new site and teach myself html, javascript, and webgl along the way (possibly before hand).</s><s> hopefully i'll get working on the new site before the end of the year.</s><s> in the mean time, i'm using my old site as a stop-gap measure.</s><s> i've also taken books out from the library to begin journey into the above mentioned languages. 
</s><s>this all said, i'm looking for some advice on what direction i should go next...look into...</s><s> does my current objective seem reasonable?</s><s> also, could anyone give feedback on what i did wrong and what i've done right on my old site.</s><s> i think, as far as what went wrong, the flash page is just too large.</s><s> no one wants to wait so long for it to load.</s><s> i think i got carried away with it.</s><s> also, too many sound effects.</s><s> that said, i think the html site was constructed in an "old-fashion" way.</s><s> no one makes sites like that anymore.</s><s> i basically set it up in photoshop, sliced it, and assembled it in dreamweaver.</s><s> the end result is a bunch of tables in html?</s><s> a friend suggested i look into a cms (?</s><s>) like wordpress? 
</s><s>here's my current site: http://www.personal.kent.edu/~mstingle/ 
constructive feedback on what i did right and wrong would be great.</s><s> and, where i should be looking next for rebuild of my portfolio.

<s>webgl is still  experimental.  most browsers don't fully support it yet. http://caniuse.com/webgl   the current trend is responsive web design -- layouts that work in all devices (mobile, tablet and desktop).  this technology relies on css layouts (no tables) with media queries for different viewport widths.  below is a crude example built with the fluidgrid layouts feature in dw cs6 or cc: http://alt-web.com/fluidgrid/fluid2.html  -- resize your browser's viewport to see it in action.   flash is dead on the web now because the world's most popular mobile & tablet devices don't support it.  animations are mostly being built with html5, css3 and javascript.  see adobe edge animate.   if you're not a skilled coder and just want a basic static web site, adobe muse might be all you need.  http://www.adobe.com/products/muse.html   that said, muse cannot support server-side programming so you can't use it for advanced features like cmss, blogs, etc...   if you're a creative cloud member, you can use behance & prosite to build & share your portfolio online. http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud/behance-community.html http://prosite.com/   in terms of your own site, ask yourself how much content & which features it will need to support in the coming months/years.  if it's going to be a relatively small site (under 20 pages), a static html site is probably all you need.  imo, wordpress -- a dynamic cms built with php & mysql databases -- would be overkill.  however, if you plan to make your site into a  blog for example, then a dynamic cms is an option to consider.  wordpress isn't the only kid on the block either.  there's also drupal, joomla!, and many more...     nancy o.

<s>it's hard to say.</s><s> mobile devices do their best to resize & scale web pages to "fit." but it's far from perfect because most sites are not exactly 900px wide. 
</s><s>the trend today -- spawned mainly out of necessity -- is responsive web design.</s><s> the one-size-fits-all approach we used back when everyone had roughly the same size screens doesn't cut it anymore.</s><s> today, we need multiple layouts optimized for various devices.</s><s> and to prevent mobiles from resizing & scaling layouts, we must use the viewport meta tag.

<s>hi all.</s><s> 
</s><s>i am looking at adobe products and already have creative suite for a (primarily) poster creation workflow which i am very happy with.</s><s> i need to redo an existing "iframes" based website after having created a nice blog using the wordpress blog themes. 
i am hoping someone can help me with advice on adobe specific software i might use of other advice, suggestions etc. 
background: 
i have been really happy with my ability to organize a very large amount of images in an aperture database on the mac and to publish them easily to flickr (among other things). this has now freed me up to focus on creating a new website for an old website that needs updating. right now i have just created a /link/ for the pictures on the webpages which takes the viewer to the flickr albums. 
i am looking at "themes" such as the wordpress photography theme (http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/photography/) and i am also looking at sites that are using the "autoviewer" or "autoviewer pro" software. 
http://www.iloveconcrete.net/drive1/drive1.html 
http://www.simpleviewer.net/autoviewer/ 
anyway, i am familiar with using wordpress ui but i am desperately trying to find a method where i don't have to use the wordpress image uploader.</s><s> i guess the holy grail would be to just "publish" album "code" out of aperture that i would then embed into a wp theme website which i am sure i could create in a week or something. 
anyway, does anyone know of anywhere i can ask such questions or get some leads on keeping this workflow simple but create a nice website at the same time?

<s>hi nancy, dweb3d. 
this is really great help and i very much appreciate it. 
can i please ask you some follow ups here as i try and get this together? 
for instance my thought at the moment is to use the sidewinder theme [http://graphpaperpress.com/themes/sidewinder/] which i am sort of guessing uses a "parallel" or "plugin" (not sure how you would terms this but) it is called photoshelter [http://www.photoshelter.com/about/wordpress]. 
am i correct in thinking that it is this plugin that makes the functionality of sidewinder complete? 
also, would something as straighforward as a wp plugin (such as ngg gallery) allow me to basically export my aperture album images to the desktop and then upload them to ftp to get them into the wp blog?</s><s> or are the answers here indicating that i would need a customized set of coding instructions embedded in the blog to get this to happen? 
i mean, i guess in an ideal world at some time in the future there could be e link between my aperture albums and the images displayed in my wp portfolio blog but for the meantime can anyone help me with understanding what it might take to do a reasonably fluid facsimile of this workflow...</s><s>?</s><s> 
</s><s>i guess i am not understanding how all the parts discussed here either relate or don't relate...

<s>my earlier solution was for a custom scripted gallery page.</s><s> i tossed it out here as an example of what can be accomplished with css & php code alone (no wordpress required). 
</s><s>if you're set on using wordpress to develop your site, sidewinder is a wp theme with a built-in jquery based photo scroller.</s><s> themes effect your blog's appearance and functionality.</s><s> if a theme lacks certain functionality that you require, you can usually find it in third party plug-ins.</s><s> however, not all plug-ins work with all themes and vice versa. 
</s><s>some trial & error is required to ascertain which themes work best with which plug-ins.</s><s> to save time, i typically look for themes (free or paid) that have all the basic functionality i require built-in to them. 
</s><s>photoshelter & ngg are examples of plug-ins but i honestly don't know if they would be compatible with the sidewinder theme.</s><s> for better answers, you would have to ask the theme / plug-in developers or other wordpress users. http://wordpress.org/support/

<subject>Fluid Grid Layout - Can I nix .gridContainer styles?</subject>
<post author="Geobop" timestamp="Nov 17, 2013 10:34 AM">
<s>i'm learning how to design for mobile sites using dreamweaver's fluid grid layout.</s><s> it's working far better than i expected, but one problem i encountered is too much padding at really small screen sizes.</s><s> when you view something in a cell phone, you generally want little or no padding at all, right? 
</s><s>anyway, i discovered the problem - width, margin and padding applied to .gridcontainer in the style sheet fluid.css.</s><s> to fix it, i simply added a style in a personal style sheet: 
@media all and (max-width: 700px) { .gridcontainer { width: 100%; margin: 0; padding: 0; } 
</s><s>so any screen size of 700 pixels or less now has no padding - unless i decide to add it, probably in a div nested inside .gridcontainer, because i generally want my headers and footers to span the page. 
</s><s>it seems to be working great; i haven't noticed any obvious problems, though i haven't published any pages online yet.</s><s> i don't even own a smart phone, so i'm testing my pages in dreamweaver's multiscreen preview and http://mobiletest.me/

</s><s>if it was a background image, i could just declare two different background images based on screen size, but i don't know of any way to swap between images actually inserted in a page.

</s><s>but i started playing with dreamweaver's fluid grid layout and was amazed at how easy it is.</s><s> i'm really a lightweight when it comes to technical challenges.</s><s> i prefer to spend most of my time researching and writing, so i like to get the technical stuff out of the way as quickly and easily as possible. 
</s><s>i've always thought web design was a little anal retentive - so many special rules and subrules, microsoft hacks, browser detection schemes and javascript workarounds.</s><s> the fluid grid layout scheme seems to simple; then again, i guess they've allowed for many of the special rules and hacks in the attached files. 
</s><s>an even better surprise is that designing for mobile devices has helped my standard-sized pages.</s><s> in fact, my new home pages, in particular, look like works of art compared to the original.</s><s> part of it is being forced to cram more material into a smaller space, which forces me to pay more attention to what i put on a page and how and where i put it.</s><s> another benefit is that i've discovered new things that make design more user friendly.</s><s> for example, i never knew you could assign image widths in percentages. 
</s><s>of course, when i finally get my upgraded websites published online - hopefully about new years - i may discover lots of mistakes that need to be fixed.</s><s> but so far i'm finding mobile design 1) amazingly easy, and 2) spectacularly helpful in upgrading my websites, even for larger browsers. 
</s><s>have you had a similar experience, or am i going to sing a different tune once i get more deeply involved in mobile design?

<subject>Observations on Mobile Web Design</subject>
<post author="Rik%20Ramsay" timestamp="Nov 18, 2013 9:12 AM">
<s>my own experience is that thinking of 'mobile-first' releases the shackles of normal, rigid web design.</s><s> if you think about it logically, a large part of making a good site is down to the structure of the html and if you can nail that then the css is a real easy addition.</s><s> i have managed to reduce the size of my css quite dramatically as i think about the structure more and reduce the requirement for classes and id's which in turn cleans everything up. 
</s><s>all this is also helped by the browsers ability to render css3 well.</s><s> whereas in the past we had to worry about ie6, 7 and even 8, now 6,7 are obsolete and 8 is not far away so we are dealing with standards compliant browsers to allow us to safely use these new techniques (for the most part). 
i have never used the fluid grids feature in dw as i prefer to code my own but using % widths, % and em (soon rem) for font-size, helps keep your design flexible and is definitely the way forward. 
<quote>
<s>for example, i never knew you could assign image widths in percentages. 
</s></quote>setting an image to 100% will scale the image to 100% of it's container.</s><s> with new retina displays (2:1 pixel ratio), i find it safer to specify the actual image size in px (on the element) as this also works in older browsers and then overrule that with % widths on smaller screens. 
</s><s>as a side note, you can also set % and em widths to margins and padding.

<s>hi,   i can write code and work with databases, but for some reason i just can't slice up a .psd file and get it in to my html.  i can slice simple images but right now i'm trying to figure out how to slice up this rectangular search bar that has a gradient and an input box for the user to type in keywords.</s><s> if possible, please look at the attached image.     the search bar should span the width of the available space, the text should be editable and i should be able to type into the input box.  right now it's in psd format layered.  how can i slice up this artwork in a way where i can build the html.</s><s> ultimately, i'd like my html to be something like the below and use css to handle the background images, etc.  i just can't seem to figure how to do the photoshop/fireworks part.   <div id="searchbar">     <div>       <h2>search product catalog</h2>     <input class="custominput" type="text" name="searchkeywords" id="searchkeywords" />   </div> </div>   any help would be huge, and i think if someone can help me i can just get it down from here on out.  i've googled for tutorials but most are just showing how to slice, but they don't take the slice all the way to the html side.  a few questions i constantly struggle with:   the above image has a gradient and i'm unclear on do i just take a vertical rectangle sample of it and make it repeat in css?</s><s> or do i export the whole gradient image?</s><s> the search input box has a background gradient.  what would the file look like that i would export from my graphics program to make this work in the html?  the graphic has borders already in the .</s><s>psd file, should i recreate those in css or do i retain the borders when i export it from photoshop/fireworks?</s><s> how many slices would i need?</s><s> i guess this varies?   regards,   -ws
