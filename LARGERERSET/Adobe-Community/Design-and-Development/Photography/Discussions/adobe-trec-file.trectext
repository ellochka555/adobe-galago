<subject>Costco labs, auto correct and exif data?</subject>
<post author="Owen Carey" timestamp="Apr 6, 2011 11:58 PM">
<s>i recently sent some work to a costco lab that has done good work for me over the years.</s><s> once the file is ready and sized and output sharpened, i convert to the custom icc profile for the lab and machine and paper that i'm using, and softproof for it. this has worked fine for years, just as it works fine for the professional labs i use for my more important professional work.</s><s> i work with a regularly calibrated system, because i want to be in control of the process from beginning to end. 
</s><s>costco has always had a checkbox in their upload procedure for the option to have them auto correct the color.</s><s> i have always opted to turn that off - because i have already made all the adjustments necessary for their machine to translate the photoshop numbers from my machine to theirs correctly -- just hit the print button, please and don't make any changes...</s><s> it's already been profiled for your machine and i have made all the adjustments i deem necessary, thank you. 
</s><s>they have always agreed with that - until now. the recent images i sent were way off - too light, too green - horrible - i checked the profile - it was the correct new profile - all should have went well. 
</s><s>the tech mgr there told me that the problem was that i had used photoshop to prepare the images, and he told me that ps ( i'm on cs5 - and lightroom 3 - all updated ) by default would strip the exif data from my files.</s><s> really?</s><s> i thought.</s><s> i've never known that to be true , plus i want all the metadata intact, so my files contain the contact and copyright info, iptc data and all the exif data.</s><s> the technician told me that was the problem- since my files did contain exif info, their computer thought it was just any random file sent in and costo's machine then- by default - ignored my request to not auto correct -- they then auto corrected the file screwing up the color. their computer/printer- a big noritzu unit, apparently always auto corrects any files that have exif data, whether you tell it to auto correct or not. 
</s><s>so how does one avoid this?</s><s> their upload process confirms that i chose to shut down auto correct - yet they auto correct, making things incorrect.</s><s> so my question to all and anyone out there: is the solution to go into ps preferences in the file handling tab and click on: ignore exif profile tag in the file compatibility box?</s><s> it is currently clicked off.</s><s> would that fool their machine?</s><s> is that the solution to my problem? 
and if i do indeed want to maintain all the exif data in my files but want to strip it just from a file i send to costco or any lab that hash as similar issue - how would i go about stripping the exif info just from the jpeg i am uploading to them?

</s><s>it's not photoshop's fault, it's (your) user error.</s><s> costco is not auto-correcting either, it's misinterpreting the number as being in the srgb color space rather than in the costco profile color space.

<post author="Owen%20Carey" timestamp="Apr 13, 2011 12:03 AM">
<s>thanks for all the responses -- however i'm still perplexed. #1 - i never use "save for web" in ps.</s><s> i have created actions over the years that have incrementally scaled down ( or up with my actions or with software plugins ) my images to the appropriate size for print and for web, using the knowledge i've obtained studying with some of the members of the "adobe pixel mafia" -i.e: some of the pixel genius people.</s><s> i always tag my images- everything - first working from 16 bit raw files, converting them in the end to the icc profile appropriate for each printing device being used.</s><s> if i were saving i file for the web i would use my action to scale things down from a 21 megapixel file @ 300 ppi, sizing it down in small increments, using bicubic sharper, to 72 ppi at whatever size necessary, and convert to srgb, keeping all my metadata intact. the action literally takes less than a second on a fast machine with lots of ram.</s><s> that way neither the color profile or my metadata, with copyright and contact info etc, gets stripped. 
i realize that costco expects srgb files from most users- except for the pros like myself who use their custom icc profiles for specific machines at specific costco's for specific papers.</s><s> over the years i have converted to their custom profiles with excellent results - usually better than with an srgb file. 
when this problem arose recently, i rechecked everything and made and uploaded two versions- their custom profile and an srgb version.</s><s> both were awful, and pretty much identical.</s><s> i'm pretty sure it's not photoshop's fault for all the reasons you mentioned -- and i'm damned sure it's not my fault either.</s><s> when i soft proofed both versions on a 24 in apple led display calibrated that morning, there were slight changes - perhaps 2 points of yellow added to the image and a slight loss of d-max in the shadows - a very slight change on my screen that was barely noticeable and miniscule and acceptable when softproofing.... figured if they were off by much i could do the slight tweaking if i had to -- 
this costco in particular had a problem last year with their custom profile and actually called me to advise me to use the srgb profile instead for the time being until they fixed the problem.</s><s> those srgb file looked fine then -- but now that they have created - and i am using - the latest custom profile, the resulting prints were way off.</s><s> it was as though the file had been brightened 1/2 to 2/3rds of a stop, making clearly evident the color shifts that needed to be corrected.</s><s> i was advised that their auto correct feature does lighten when it thinks it needs it. 
their explanation was that in using their online upload process -- not doing it at the store with their computers -- their machine would ignore my instructions to turn off their auto correct feature.</s><s> ( because i used photoshop, which i thought was a bogus explanation- hence my original query ) 
</s><s>isn't the point of using their custom profile an attempt to achieve better and more accurate color than if using srgb - so if i've already corrected it for their machine and paper- why would they then auto correct it to something else - and to what exactly?</s><s> srgb - or converting it again to the custom profile.</s><s> it obviously also tried to adjust brightness levels as well. 
</s><s>so still not sure what the answer is with this lab -- but thank you for the advice on how to strip exif data from a file should i ever want to. 
all the best -- but still looking for answers...

<post author="Photo%20Nopoulis" timestamp="Nov 10, 2011 8:54 PM">
<s>owen, i've done a fair amount of print testing at costco.</s><s> here's what i've learned through numerous conversations with many costco employees, through tens of hours of trial and error, and many, many test prints of identical images: 
the gain of 1/2 to 2/3 stop of brightness is probably because the autocorrect "feature" was enabled, despite your instructions.</s><s> costco must manually turn this off when the print order is received by them.</s><s> it has nothing to do with the fact that you did anything to the image in photoshop.</s><s> between 5% and 30% of the time (depending on the operator, work loads, etc.</s><s>), the operator at costco will miss the request and print the image with autocorrect feature on.</s><s> check the codes on the back of the print, and if you see "nn" after "n n n n" then the autocorrect feature was on.</s><s> for images which were properly color adjusted prior to submitting to costco, but somehow are printed with autocorrect on, the colors will shift, highlights will be blown out, and you'll see the gain in brightness. 
</s><s>also, check to see when your costco lab checks its chemicals in the printer.</s><s> they typically do not do it daily, and to rule out issues along those lines, print on days that they are rebalancing the chemicals until you begin to be able to predict your print results.</s><s> out-of-balance chemicals don't result in a brightness gain, typically, so that has probably not been your problem. 
</s><s>my highest-quality procedure for using printer profiles at costco is to begin with 16-bit files in adobe '98 rgb from raw, get the image looking like you want it to look on a monitor, make a copy of the image, then take your original but modified file and press control-y to get a softproof (assuming you have photoshop set up for the printer profile you desire) and attempt to adjust the image to match the copy that you have on-screen also.</s><s> in other words, you are adjusting your image file (viewed through the lens of softproofing) to get as close of a match as possible to your copy that is not softproofed.</s><s> you won't get there, but you will get close with the right adjustments.</s><s> then come out of softproof (control-y), and perform a final save.</s><s> then convert your color space from adobe '98 rgb to your printer profile for your adjusted image, crop, resample, sharpen, and output to (save as) jpg.</s><s> feel free to cut corners as you desire.</s><s> not all images need that kind of treatment.</s><s> the extra work will provide superior color, more in some hues, less in others.</s><s> for certain photos, the effort is worthwhile in my opinion, but everyone's mileage will vary.</s><s> cheers.</s><s>

<s>i'm sure that every costco photo lab is not run the same way- i've been told that by one of the lab managers. the results can varty from lab to lab - and there are about 5 different costco labs in the portland or vicinity.</s><s> i keep up on the icc profiles for any of the labs i use.</s><s> up until my original post i have found my favorite of those labs to be quite accurate. 
</s><s>the only difference in my workflowas opposed to yours, is that prophoto rgb is my ps and lightroom workspace.</s><s> if you are working in lightroom with highest quality previews - lightroom's environment is prophoto rgb.</s><s> i use this huge 16 bit color space because i can then always convert down to a smaller color profile.</s><s> much like yourself i softproof and make the necessary changes.</s><s> my monitor can show about 97% of adobe rgb'98 and i am in a tightly and regularly calibrated environment in my studio. 
</s><s>you are absolutely right that my lab has been auto correcting something that i told them online to not auto correct. they claim that it is part of their system... and when the computer somehow knows that the custom profiled softproofed 8 bit .jpg image i have sent them was generated out of photoshop, they say their computer/printer decides it must auto correct. this is something that makes no sense to me.</s><s> they claim the only way now for me to actually turn off the auto correct feature, it to upload the order via their inhouse computer and it will then keep the auto-correct feature turned off.</s><s> i have even compared and made files both in their cutom icc profile and the satndard srgb that most people send them. the results were equally as bad. 
</s><s>i've decided instead to upload the files to my more local professional lab - who's profiles are better and much more accurate on their fuji frontirer machine.</s><s> sure the price is more expensive -- so i just raised my retail prices and kissed costco goodbye.</s><s> life is much sweeter now.

<s>obviously, you know what you are doing, owen.</s><s> i agree with your use of prophoto rgb. 
i had some large prints made at costco yesterday on its noritsu printer and the codes on the back of the prints indicated that autocorrect had been turned on.</s><s> i asked them to reprint them, and after a while, was informed that they have new software and are unable to turn off autocorrect.</s><s> that is something new at this particular costco.</s><s> since the highlights were not blown out, i'm wondering if the software did indeed automatically turn off autocorrection, but that they codes did not update as they should have.</s><s> the prints did match my softproofs.</s><s> several months ago, i tested uploads using their inhouse computers vs over the internet and did not find a difference, other than i could upload 30 mb files inhouse and not over the internet.</s><s> i did see a difference in standard srgb profiles vs the glossy noritsu profiles, but the differences were marked in only a few hues.</s><s> for some photos, the difference is critical, not for most photos. 
</s><s>the costco lab i use (in the dallas area) promised to get the software corrected soon.</s><s> again, for this particular costco lab, it remains to be seen whether the current issue (as opposed to past issues being autocorrect definitely on or poor chemicals on a rare occasion) is the autocorrect cannot be disabled or it is disabled per the user's instructions but that the codes don't reflect that.</s><s> also, i've heard from a knowledgeable source that not all the color icc profiles are correctly performed by each costco lab, so that can impact the quality of each costco's printer-and-paper-specific icc profile.</s><s> finally, this costco lab recently rotated its most experienced technicians out of the lab into other jobs within the costco, so they lost a fair amount of talent in the lab.</s><s> not fun.</s><s> i still like costco for its prices and quality, but it is less reliable than a pricier lab, perhaps.

<s>thanks andrew, that was my undertstanding as well – also for pointing out that the noritsu and frontier printers have areas that are outside the srgb gamut.</s><s> for anyone interested you can create the 3d wire models here: 
http://www.drycreekphoto.com/tools/printer_gamuts/gamutmodel.html 
you'll need to download a vrml plugin to use it.</s><s> here's one of the costco profiles showing the area that falls outside the srgb gamut: 


</s><s>here's my take on costco's noritsu & frontier printer workflow. 
</s><s>normal processing is with auto correct on, which expects srgb profiled images with no adjustments.</s><s> with auto correct on the srgb image is converted by the printer using the printer profile for the selected paper type.</s><s> it apparently also applies some kind of auto contrast and perhaps auto color correction for white balancing.</s><s> this analysis is based purely on print results obtained using standard srgb images with auto correct on. 
</s><s>with auto correct off the printer does not apply any contrast or color correction and a printer profile is not applied to the image.</s><s> if this is correct then it is absolutely necessary to "convert" your images to the costco printer profile for the target paper type after making your soft proof adjustments.</s><s> you should also preview different rendering intents in soft proof as outlined on the dry creek website.</s><s> ps has more options using 'customize proof condition' than available in lr. 
</s><s>the best analogy i can think of is auto correct on = "managed by printer" and auto correct off = "managed by application" (i.e.</s><s> ps or lr).</s><s> 
</s><s>i'll try to verify this with my local costco photo lab manager.

<s>take a look on wikipedia.org about vga, dvi, hdmi.</s><s> the biggest difference between vga and hdmi is vga is analog and hdmi is digital.</s><s> dvi on the other hand is both and there is an adapter for vga/dvi and one for dvi/hdmi.</s><s> as quite a few of the older computer only had a dvi connector.</s><s> when i looked at wikipedia about vga, i was actually shocked that the resolution went that high.</s><s> i just assumed it could not handle the extra bandwidth.</s><s> but i was wrong.</s><s> at this point in time there are very few monitors that are capable of going higher than 1080p.</s><s> but that is changing ever sense apple came out with their retina displays.</s><s> i just checked on apple's website and it looks like the retina display is 2560-by-1440 and the sharp 4k monitor is 3840 by 2160.</s><s> i don't know whats available in the window or linux market for anything higher than 1080p. but i am sure they will follow suit.

alfred stieglitz, eadweard muybridge, elliott erwitt, lee friedlander, garry winogrand,sally mann and paul strand became some of the greatest image makers by understanding that time is part of photography.</s><s> that to "capture" time you had to be sort of a zen archer knowing just when to shoot. ....

<subject>need a new digital camera - advice, please?</subject>
<post author="angelalien548" timestamp="Sep 20, 2010 10:45 AM">
<s>my dx6490 kodak digital camera started behaving erratically today when i was out taking pictures.</s><s> this is the second time this occurred (the first time i happened was july 1, 2010), i got this camera brand-new in early august 2004 - so i believe its time for me to get a new digital camera. 
</s><s>here are the things i hate about my current digital camera - 
- doesn't take very good pictures in low light (dusk, dimly-lit places), - i have to wait several seconds between shots and i often miss a good action shot (when using sport mode), - have problems taking close ups, even in close up mode - camera will not accept close up nor wide angle lenses, etc., - i have to really back up far away from the subject i'm photographing just to get all of the surrounding area in the view finder when snapping a picture - sometimes this is awkward or inconvenient, - sometimes when taking pictures of people using flash the people in front (closest to camera) are too light, people in middle lit normally, but people in back (farthest from camera) are too dark, - camera doesn't focus very well in natural indoor light (like in a shopping mall, etc.</s><s>) resulting in blurry pictures, pictures tend to be blurry even when using pasm mode without a flash; 
ok, now for the things i like about my current digital camera - 
- it allows me to photograph moving subjects (like kids running around during a basketball game) very clearly (it freezes the movement of the basketball players, resulting in clear, crisp still photos of the players when using sport mode (and the flash), - the camera is lightweight, compact so i can hold it in one hand and just aim and shoot the subject (while using sport mode), - the batteries (i have 3 of them) are infinitely rechargeable, - the camera is 4 mega pixel. 
so i'd like a recommendation of the latest digital cameras that have all of the things i like about my digital camera and none of the things i hate about it, such as, i want a camera that - 
- is lightweight/compact, can hold it in one hand, aim and shoot in sport mode using one hand, - accepts wide angle, telephoto, macro, close-up lenses, - with a flash that illuminates a group of people (closest to/middle/farthest from camera) evenly, - accepts the current batteries that i'm now using with my dx6490 kodak digital camera, - focuses very well when taking pictures in natural light (such as in a store, restaurant, or shopping mall, etc) resulting in clear, crisp photos, not too dark when not using the flash, - which i can snap, snap, snap, continuously by pressing the shutter button repeatedly at every setting/mode that i'm using, resulting in clear, crisp photos without having to wait several seconds until the camera resets/reboots (as in the case with my dx 6490 kodak) and missing a good shot that i want regardless of whether i'm using a flash or not, - takes superb pictures in low light (dusk, dimly-lit places), - accepts the current memory cards (sandisk/sd) that i'm using now. 
</s><s>well, that's all i can think of at the moment. 
</s><s>thanks in advance. 
</s><s>my budget is approx. $300 - $400, but if i can get a camera that has all the features that i'm looking for cheaper the cost, so be it.

<s>there are a million point and shoot cameras out there to choose from.all i can tell you is look for one with a good optical zoom verses digital zoom, and you will never get away from the flash falloff problem you experience until you can bounce the light off the ceiling or a card with the flash head angled up. its the nature of light falloff. look up inverse square law to grasp it. you ask a lot from a little budget but in the time since your last purchase, quality has definitely gone up. also your current sd cards may be no match for higher resolution sensors that capture 10 times the data than your 4 megapixel did,so be prepared to update your cards to the 4 gig or higher range.</s><s> i tell people to always shoot at the highest resolution their camera can take, so you can get the most out of it. people think just because they can get a thousand low res shots on a card that its great, but they are usually only good for 4x6.

</s><s>if a dslr is not needed, or within budget, then i would look for a point-n-shoot, that offers control, rather than just a programmed shooting mode. 
</s><s>also, as almost all point-n-shoots have fixed zooms, my advice would be to look for ones with the widest angle (shortest focal length) in that zoom.</s><s> a 2mm focal length difference in the wide-angle, can be noticed, where 20mm on the telephoto end, will likely go totally unnoticed. 
i would also look for a camera that has a decent macro capability (close focusing), as some product photography, used in graphic design, needs to have that capacity. 
</s><s>now, if a graphic designer, web artist, also needs to do video too, then the lineup narrows.</s><s> while most of those still cameras can do video, many use some proprietary schemes for saving the video.</s><s> those can make the footage tough to edit with most common nle (non linear editor) programs.</s><s> that could be a major consideration, as well. 
</s><s>lots to think about, and to consider.</s><s> i understand why the op is asking, though i do not see any response to the question, "what do you need to shoot?" that can be a critical question, and the answer to it, can dictate which camera many of us would recommend.</s><s> as it is, we can only guess, or add personal reflections, based on what we do.

<s>many professional graphic designers and photographers usually use digital slr cameras such as the canon 550d to take excellent, high quality photographs.but it may be tha case that you wouldn't be able to afford a camera good enough to take these kind of photos,however, that's not strictly the case as models such as the canon 550d are much more reasonably priced that other digital slrs and they achieve similar results.

<s>you seem to be pretty well set up, except i would strongly recommend a lightroom upgrade.</s><s> the new processing engine in lr 4 is a quantum leap forward. 
</s><s>now, to get rid of one common misconception right away: when you shoot raw, the in-camera color space setting is moot and irrelevant.</s><s> it only applies to the camera jpegs - a raw file doesn't have a color space until it's encoded into one.</s><s> in lightroom, that's linear prophoto (lightroom's internal working space), and from there you can export to srgb, adobe rgb or prophoto. 
</s><s>so you can just forget the camera setting.</s><s> i don't even have a clue what my cameras are set to. 
</s><s>as for monitor, you just have to consult your budget.</s><s> yes, wide gamut is very useful for print, because you can soft proof and actually get a good idea of what the final result will look like - whether offset or inkjet.</s><s> both normally have wider gamuts than srgb (can print colors outside srgb), so soft proofing on a standard gamut monitor doesn't really tell you anything.</s><s> for web, it's not only not important, but most browsers fail miserably because everything on the web assumes a standard gamut monitor.</s><s> only firefox with color management set to mode 1 (not the default) is usable with a wide gamut monitor. 
</s><s>other than that it's my personal opinion that monitor is where it really pays back to invest in a good one.</s><s> i'm not familiar with asus, but consider nec or eizo - not necessarily the most expensive models, but their quality control is consistently high and the risk of getting a lemon is virtually nil.</s><s> anyway, an ips panel is a must. 
</s><s>true 10-bit display requires that the entire display pipeline is 10-bit capable.</s><s> photoshop is ready, but not yet lightroom.</s><s> then you need a 10-bit ready video card and driver, and you need to use display port (dvi and hdmi don't have the bandwidth).</s><s> and none of this works on mac yet, windows only. 
</s><s>the benefit of 10-bit is smoother gradations, no visible banding.</s><s> it has no bearing on accuracy as such, as long as you have a good calibration and a good monitor profile.</s><s> the spyder should do very well no matter what monitor you end up with.

<s>i went ahead and purchased the wide gamut monitor. so far, i love it...</s><s> i could see the difference instantly. now i am looking back on some previous edited photos, i cant believe the difference.</s><s> i would highly recommend wide gamut to any detailed photographer.</s><s> i mostly print my photos with a professional printer so this set up will definitely pay off, i think its already started too.. the asus seems to be a pretty good monitor too, i am sure the nec are some of the best monitors out there, but this one is a good alternative. worth every penny.. thanks for the input

</s></quote>hang on a minute, just to get this clear.</s><s> normally - if you're working in a color managed environment such as lightroom or photoshop - you shouldn't see a diffference under most normal circumstances.</s><s> wide gamut is just those extra six cylinders that kick in when you need them.</s><s> but if the image is mostly contained within srgb it should display identically - that is, correctly within the monitor's limitations. 
</s><s>what happens on display is that the source profile, the document profile, is converted to the monitor profile.</s><s> this is done by the application on the fly.</s><s> the profile for the wide gamut monitor is just a bigger map, so to speak.</s><s> within the map boundaries all the points are in the same place. 
</s><s>and this is where the monitor profile becomes a critical component.</s><s> it has to be an accurate description of the monitor with all its characteristics.</s><s> a faulty monitor profile throws everything off. 
</s><s>but lots of things on your computer are not color managed.</s><s> this includes windows explorer and the windows desktop - and here everything appears incorrectly oversaturated.</s><s> see also what i wrote above about web browsers. 
</s><s>just making sure we get this right...

<s>you generally want to set the iso as high as it will go on your 350d, which looks to be iso 1600.</s><s> your kit zoom lens is a bit on the "slow" side for low light photography, meaning that it doesn't have a very wide maximum aperture.</s><s> a good lens to start with for what you want might be the 85mm 1.8, which is moderately fast with f/1.8, and quite affordable being somewhere in the $300 range.</s><s> i like to shoot raw images using aperture preferred auto exposure, usually setting the exposure compensation to +1 or more.</s><s> it's not unusual to have very warm images as the lighting in nightclubs tends to be that way.</s><s> by shooting raw files, you will be able to easily compensate for any lighting to any degree you want, keeping in mind that warm skintones tend to look better than neutral skin tones in photos taken in these conditions.

<s>there is also the technique known as "dragging the shutter speed" that you can use in a night club where the camera meters for the ambient light and the flash is used as a fill.</s><s> here is a sample photo that illustrate the effect (look at the exif: 1/2s, f8.0, iso400 with flash): http://www.pbase.com/digitalfrog/image/54221395 (i didn't want to embed the picture because it's not my photo, i don't even know the guy) here is a more extreme example (0.77s, f/5.0, iso200 with flash): http://www.pbase.com/digitalfrog/image/47954111 you can vary the shutter speed to get different effects.</s><s> start with a speed of 1/30s first to see the effect you get and then go to lower speed if you want as you get accustomed with the technique.

<s>rene, when you're pushing the limits, every f-stop counts.</s><s> primes are not only faster and sharper (at least this group of primes) but also have a higher transmissiveness of light, so even for the same aperture, you'll get a higher shutter speed.</s><s> i own three versions of the 70-200, and just don't take them to places that are this dark.</s><s> some shows they'd be fine for, but nothing comes close to what the 200 1.8 does wide open.</s><s> a little aside relating to light transmission.</s><s> last saturday i spent the afternoon testing the new 200mm f/2 canon lens, comparing it to my 1.8.</s><s> in the tests i did i could see any discernable difference between the lenses in resolution at comparable apertures, but what i did find was that for a given manually set exposure, in this case 1/80 @ f/2, the same scene at samy's was about 1/3 stop brighter with the old 1.8 lens.</s><s> this probably means that the greater number of elements in the newer lens are absorbing a bit more light.</s><s> i had to stop the 1.8 lens down to 2.2 to equal the illumination of the 2.0 lens.</s><s> so, when given that the older lens is not only brighter at the same aperture, but can also open up another third of a stop, the real difference in light gathering is closer to 2/3 of a stop in terms of shutter speed under marginal conditions.</s><s> that would have meant that some of those 1/100th shutter speeds would have come down to 1/60th or so to get the same actual exposure.</s><s> for normally lit scenes, outdoor, etc, it would never be a factor, but in extremely low light, it is.</s><s> i wonder if t-stops will ever become common in stills like they are in film.</s><s> linda, this band is so much fun, both to listen to, and also for the musicians.</s><s> the level of musicianship is very high and the energy is contagious.</s><s> too bad you're all the way on the other side of the country.</s><s> didn't you say your husband had a small plane?</s><s> you could be here by sunday night...

<s>canon's t-mount debacle was fresh in my mind when i bought my first nikon body.</s><s> i had a couple of pro friends who had invested heavily in canon t glass who were left high and dry by canon's "wham, bam, thank you ma'am, now go buy new glass for your new eos" approach.</s><s> second time they'd done that, too.</s><s> i admit that was also still fresh in my mind when nikon decided that dx was its pro format and those of us with wide ff glass suddenly had to buy that end again and i thought that nikon had caught canon's disregard for their customers, but the 12-24 and 10.5 fisheye were not as prohibitive as the other option of swapping the whole lot for ff canon gear, so i stuck with nikon.</s><s> let's face it, most of the initial ship jumping was perpetrated by the media, who could well afford it.</s><s> in that world photographic equipment only lasts for a couple of years before careless use by photographers who don't own the equipment renders it useless and in need of replacement, which is done without a second's thought.</s><s> brand commitment isn't necessary.</s><s> in my world equipment has to last for a decade or more, so that and a distrust of canon's commitment to supporting continuity led me to stick with nikon with the d2x, which has served admirably well and will continue to do so at a reduced level (close-up copies on the copy-stand, 1.5x pseudo 300mm 12mp crop at 200mm).</s><s> one thing though; now the d3's here, i'm glad i did.

<s>larry, thanks, i bought 1- 1 million and 1-two million spotlight by garrity corp. they say they are good for 25 minutes, but that always seems optomistic. so far i have been able to shoot whatever i want in one evening shoot using the two units. they say not to use them constantly on, but i use them in bursts from 20 seconds to a minute or so at a clip. it really is dependant on your subject distance, how much juice you will need. the barns were at roughly 60-90 feet away,and i usually shoot around f11.</s><s> i would get two- 2 millions if i did it again. they are not twice as bright,but somewhat brighter.</s><s> when i first got them,i tried to make all kinds of diffusion to make the beam wider/softer, and i accomplished it,but it either was nice soft light, for closer stuff, or it knocked the thing back too far. they are actually perfect for when you get outside and do buildings or whatever.</s><s> i usually hit my subject and move fairly quickly all over it,to give a softer ovrall effect,because if you pause in one region too long it has more of a spotlit effect, which can be cool also.</s><s> if you want to use them for interiors, i found using a can of rustoleum- frosted glass spray paint on plexiglass, gave me a good balance of power and softer light.</s><s> here is a link to their site.</s><s> i have the s700,and s900g.</s><s> i paid 28.95 for the 2mill,and 19.95 for the 1mill.</s><s> i think with a little practice you could actually light interiors with these.</s><s> i bought a two headed leash clip,so i can hook them to my pants beltloop to walk hands free. http://www.garritylites.com/page79.html

<s>donald if you want a powerful diffused light a white surface such as an illustration board ora shiny surface such as a foil board facing the subject at an angle toward the light source which would be facing away from the subject would give you a fairly well diffused light.</s><s> or you can use your flash units in the same way and do multiple pops with multiple exposures and you can achieve even more control as you can vary the output of the flash or portable strobe.</s><s> o f course if you had several strobes and or flash units you can achieve even greater control.</s><s> and if you had access to the property they could be placed at varying positions within in the frame of reference.</s><s> i just photographed the new museum here in new york and wanted t iluminate the bowery street sign on the lamppost in the foreground and use a simply hand held flash to do so for both daylight and dusk shots..</s><s> it worked treat!</s><s> but i am pleased that you are making progress in developing your techniques in this area.</s><s> now to get you to photograph more substantial compositions rahter than matter of fact.

<s>i would love to hear some explanation of how he thinks i could do better. at that location,you have a small pond which reflects the image, and if you back up to include the whole pond,you end up going downhill till you have no reflection,which is the main shot with this place.</s><s> i can understand the concept of placing the subject in its surroundings,but i think the structures are quite interesting and detailed and choose to focus my efforts on capturing them. if i go wider,i get a set of trailers, a highway,a warehouse etc.</s><s> i know if i get snow,there are a few angles that will be wider,yet cleaner,but i just dont feel like making grass in winter take up half my shot as is the current look.</s><s> i am open to any different ideas that are offered, and we all see things differently.of the two shots wade posted,i really like the cityscape alot, but the interior does nothing for me.</s><s> i am not crazy about the wall on the left,and the room just does not have an inviting feel to it for me. it reminds me the owners were just getting their furniture out for the season,and were not finished yet.</s><s> i think it needs a foreground element,and as i look at it,i wonder why the chair would be so far from the fireplace,and be on the corner like that?but there again,thats my impression only.

<s>well let me put it this way the overall general concern that many or perhaps most photographers have when a capturing imagery and developing their composition is an irrational concept of purity and perfection.</s><s> they immediately eliminate all so called distractions and isolate their subject and hollywoodize the subject visually to the point of unrealistic heights in other words they transform the subject from the time space continuum to another dimension or portray it as phony triteness.</s><s> look how perfect the subject is i made it look better than it really is then if that be the case why not pick a subject you respected in the first place.</s><s> commercially the rationale is i am making the product as appealing as possible and i say you are making as unbelievable as possible.</s><s> such as donald did with the farm building under the guise of preserving its historic integrity which he is not doing by trying to disguise the true circumstance of the context and imply that that this structure was out in some pristine farmland which it is not and probably never was in such a situation.</s><s> if you ever worked in an ad agency or design studio you will see how they go to such length to reinvent the world just for the sole purpose of proving how deceitful they can really be.</s><s> and then of course they go on the weekend to march on washington for truth and justice.</s><s> i know i am going over board but for a reason.</s><s> you can memorialize something but the danger here is that you leave out a more important and powerful message.</s><s> even when you isolate the subject there is still context to be realized and expressed and if you think about it and rid the task of all the don'ts then you can see a clearer image a far more dynamic way of expressing the subject.</s><s> probably the warehouse donald refers to could have added a dimension he simply overlooked, he clearly indicates he was fearful of bringing it into the composition.</s><s> but even at that the composition is lacking in reference to any time or space there is no way to even know if this is even a real structure and then he went and photographed it at a time when the coloring of light made it look unrealistically ideal.</s><s> not exactly the stated goal of presenting it as an historic record.</s><s> nothing wrong with donald's approach but there is so much more to be had!</s><s> imo!</s><s>

<s>>how do you account for differences in photographic materials?</s><s> which is the best?</s><s> why?</s><s> how about 3d?</s><s> motion?</s><s> 360 degree coverage?</s><s> al of these offer a different ability to express a subject and has time has proven that they have not replaced one another except for 360 i=which is not a part of the category.</s><s> 3d has technology development in front of it and motion does not offer the viewer a way of studying the the subject in the same way as still photography does but does offer a very good alternative.</s><s> it also might need some more development which it is getting.</s><s> documentation is not the focus here but donald's response is a very good one and shows that he does understands.</s><s> in case you are interested lawrence that is a far cry from the response i might have gotten a or two ago.</s><s> as i was really encouraging donald to go further because i think that will open up the possibilities for him and ken is is interested in discussing the issue as well.</s><s> donald you are correct there is nothing about your desire to express things in a certain way, that's what makes you what you are but the inhibition to develop it further is something you might like to think about of course i speak from my own point of view.</s><s> i think the fact that you showed here a lot os smarts in the way you lit the subject and took control of it to be also a big step forward and not allow yourself to be tied to a technique you were using to control what you do.</s><s> >so ken, does the camera work ok now?</s><s> lawrence you remind me of a incident in my drawing class and the teacher was charles cajori and after a year of interacting with a few of the students who had a hard time relating to what he had to tell them he was engaged in a conversation about a drawing with perhaps the student who had the most difficult time understanding and i heard the response from the this student something like this"yes i see what you mean, i see how the negative space between the shapes have an impact on the composition and relative spatial qualities and that every time one adds to the composition this these shapes and lines have a relative effect on the rest of the composition and this now makes the spatial relationship different as well and then perhaps one has to now look at the negative space and rethink how the shapes are relating to each other.</s><s> and cajori say that's cool you really do understand now!</s><s> and the student responds and says so you think i should move the vase over an 1/8 of an inch?</s><s> and cajori throws his hands up in the air in defat!</s><s> and he looks at me and says its the last class of the year.</s><s> and smiles.</s><s> some people never get it.</s><s> but donald does get it.</s><s> it is not something donald has to do anything with unless he decides this is something it has meaning to him at the time.</s><s> but it is good that he sees the possibilities, remember lawrence at one time selling his images was a bit foreign to him as well even though he wanted to do so!</s><s> and i think ken will benefit from discussing compositional approaches as well.</s><s> i know i always do i love the technique of using those lights i think that was either your idea or ramón's.</s><s> i usually use a flash but i will consider the lights donald is using.</s><s> i think linda would find them interesting as well.

<s>for reasons mentioned before i choose to stay with lenses made by the manufacturer of the camera i'm using.</s><s> while having no doubt that there are some good third-party lenses made, the fact is that as they have to be designed to fit multiple lens mounts, differing distances from the rear element to the sensor and differing auto-focus couplings means that there have to be compromises.</s><s> the other factor in that they have to be made cheaper (or else what would be the point?</s><s>) is also a consideration.</s><s> to some (and this is particularly the case with online reviewers), photographing straight lines and having a "sharp" result overrides all other considerations.</s><s> that detail resolution (which is i not the same as visual sharpness), tonality and colour fidelity rarely, if ever, get a mention, misses the point altogether as far as i'm concerned.</s><s> anyone who has regularly used leitz, zeiss, schneider or rodenstock lenses will understand what i mean.</s><s> having owned a number of third party lenses in the past, as well as lenses by the four german manufacturers, my impression is that oem japanese lenses are not as good as the germans in those latter qualities, and the after-market lenses are not as good to the same degree as the oem lenses.</s><s> there are bound to be exceptions, but as a rule you get what you pay for, and the difference is more than just an inflated price for the words "canon", "nikon", "pentax", olympus" etc branded on the barrel.</s><s> of course the oem lenses i'm referring to here are those manufacturers' pro lines - the prosumer versions are built at a price to compete with the after-market varieties and suffer similar compromises in design (apart from having to adapt to other lens mounts and af systems).

<s>ho, i don't often agree with ken rockwell's insights, but i think he is on the money in predicting a limited future for the 14-24.</s><s> it may well be an ultra-sharp lens, but the compromises in losing the ability to put a polariser (or any filter) on the lens in order to gain that 14mm wide-angle accompanied by the limits that the standard edge distortion (stretched out circles, instantly obese people) that always accompanies such ultra-wide rectilinear lenses could become tedious after a while.</s><s> having to change lenses at 24mm on full-frame is also a limitation, though not so bad on dx, of course.</s><s> only a couple of decades ago 24mm was still considered an ultra-wide on 35mm, so when i made my choice to replace the 12-24 that i had been using on the d2x with a wide zoom for the d3 i went with the more expensive 17-35 f/2.8 as being the more versatile lens, even if the aforementioned mr rockwell lauds the 14-24's exceptional sharpness as being unapproachable.</s><s> as i said above, there's more to a lens than sharpness or pincushion/barrel distortion.</s><s> the 12-24 nikkor is a good lens, but i think a lot of the claims on it were made on the online reviews.</s><s> having used it for nearly three years i rate it as good but not excellent.</s><s> its full-frame equivalent in the 17-35 is miles ahead in visual and overall performance, and i guess the price differential between the two means something here as well.</s><s> as such i'd be inclined to believe feedback that the tokina 12-24 is an equal to nikon's version.</s><s> as an f/4 lens, the nikkor could not have been truly regarded as one of nikon's "pro" lenses which are usually characterised by a constant maximum aperture of f/2.8 or better from 300mm downwards.</s><s> it has turned out to be, as those more astute than myself observed at the time, a stop-gap wide for dx while nikon worked in secret and in denial on a full-frame sensor camera.</s><s> (edit: cross-post - i was responding to your mention of the 14-24 and 12-24 lenses in the earlier post)

<s>sorry, larry, in light of much personal experience with third-party optics, i can, and i will, paint with that broad brush.</s><s> i don't photograph black lines on white paper, nor do i photograph brick walls.</s><s> i photograph in real-life, 3 dimensional, variable light situations, and too right you can pick the difference between top oem glass and their prosumer glass and the third-party glass manufacturers when used in a broad range of situations.</s><s> my clients don't read the name on the lens barrel either - they generally are nowhere near me in time or space when i take the photographs.</s><s> i could be using an inverted milk bottle for all they know.</s><s> to postulate that this is a reason that those of us who choose to extend our wallets to buy the best oem glass is plain wrong and sells many of us well short in the brains/knowledge/experience department.</s><s> re calibration: i've said it before, repeatedly, that i have i never had a nikkor lens do anything but focus dead on target on i any of the six nikon cameras i have owned.</s><s> no matter which combination of lens/body i have used.</s><s> the lens calibration problem is just another internet myth to me.</s><s> of course a lens needs calibration if you drop it on concrete, but forget/omit to mention the dropping bit and suddenly a dreadful problem is born.</s><s> i'm not saying everything leaves the pro oem factory perfect, but the design is sound if the manufacturing is up to spec.</s><s> the problem with third-party is that the design is open to compromise by fitment and price, which no amount of "calibration" will remedy.</s><s> after several slow-to-learn experiences with mid-market nikkors as well as the aforementioned third-party lenses (several sigmas and tamrons, in my case), i will now never buy anything other than from the oem top shelf - their prosumer lenses, as i said before, are not in the same league of their top glass.</s><s> i'd hazard that it is the same story for canon, but i'll leave that comment for canon users, never having owned a canon camera myself.</s><s> otoh, if for some future reason i do switch to canon, you can bet your bippy that i've learnt by now that only l lenses would get into my bag.</s><s> re german lenses: my stipulation before was meant for actual i german lenses, not german i licensed optics made in some third-party factory in korea, thailand, china, canada or wherever.</s><s> the stuff that came out of the zeiss factory in germany for hasselblads was i designed for hasselblad.</s><s> the rollei equivalents do i not share the same lens barrel, focusing helicoids and often element arrangement with merely a different bayonet screwed on as is the case with the third party lenses i was referring to.</s><s> they are built entirely for the camera for which they are intended.</s><s> the large format mounting of rodenstock and schneider lenses does not apply in this camera type comparison - the lens board is infinitely moveable so the design of the lens is not compromised by the lens point of attachment, a solid bayonet mount on an slr is not the same thing.</s><s> canon has a thinner body mount of different diameter to nikon.</s><s> a lens designed for both cameras via adapter cannot make full advantage of each individual camera's physical attributes.</s><s> at the tolerances in play with small format lenses, any drift from the ideal will be noticed somewhere.</s><s> really, i'm also beyond fed-up with people who write anything they feel like on their online "reviews" and that this garbage is picked up as fact by the leagues of those who should know better.</s><s> it should be abundantly clear by now that most of these keyboard-jockey reviewers have very little knowledge, training or experience in photography, and do it mainly for the money that your click on their website generates from their sponsors' ads.</s><s> never was this better brought home than the recent spate of "tests" and "reviews" that accompanied the release of the d3 and d300 nikons.</s><s> the crap that was written often defied belief.</s><s> you do get what you pay for, pure and simple.</s><s> if third party was so good, nikon, canon etc would never sell another pro lens.</s><s> i'd like to think that most pros have a better grip on reality than to base their purchases on what their clients might see stamped on the lens barrel.</s><s> and i have never - i ever - based my pricing on what brand of camera lens i use.

<s>what is this hang-up on lens "calibration"?</s><s> again - i have bought numerous nikon lenses and used them on numerous bodies and have i never had to do anything like have them "calibrated".</s><s> they i always focus correctly throughout the focusing range.</s><s> even the two pro-sumer nikkors i have owned.</s><s> this has nothing to do with reading reviews here or anywhere else - it is actual working experience with the lenses themselves.</s><s> buy top-shelf, and as nikon themselves point out, you won't have to adjust, either.</s><s> as i've suggested in the past, nikon probably added this "feature" to the new range to extend the life of old and worn lenses, or to help people using third-party or prosumer lenses to fine-tune them, or maybe it's just because canon introduced the feature and it's a case of keeping up with them.</s><s> larry, i am fully aware of the differences of zeiss for rollei and for hasselblad - which is why i brought that up.</s><s> zeiss germany are not a third-party lens manufacturer (adapting kyocera-made contax lenses with a zeiss label on them for nikon, pentax and leica does not make zeiss a third-party lens producer either, imo).</s><s> they design lenses for the specific camera brand, not adapt existing lenses to fit via adapter.</s><s> and back to the broad brush - i have yet to see anyone i prove through actual photographs that i any third-party lens (sigma, tamron, etc) is i better than the equivalent top-shelf oem lens.</s><s> fact is that is pure fantasy, and to lead people to believe otherwise is plain wrong.</s><s> oem top-shelf is designed and built without compromise regardless of cost.</s><s> third party is built very much compromised and with acute attention to cost.</s><s> to think that a $700 third-party lens will be better than a $2,000 oem optic is dreaming.</s><s> i'm not trashing third-party either, rather sending a warning not to expect lead to work like gold as some would have us believe.</s><s> for sure there are very good third party lenses, but for example to speculate that say a macro tamron 90mm f/2.8 is somehow going to be better overall than the equivalent nikkor 105mm f/2.8 (as i have seen done in another place) is misleading and to protest that in the light of personal experience with third-party lenses and the oem version is not engaging in a platform war but merely pointing out that the choice to spend the extra money is a sound one i if one can afford or justify it.</s><s> i never said to anyone that they shouldn't consider third -party, just the truth that top-shelf oem will always be better overall.</s><s> tamron, sigma etc are not nikkor gold ring or canon l lenses.</s><s> never have been, never will be, pure and simple.
