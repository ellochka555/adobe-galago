<subject>Save Illustrator PDF for unknown usage</subject>
<post author="LAOPeroxide" timestamp="Mar 10, 2014 3:10 AM">
<s>does anyone have any thoughts/recommendations for how to best save an illustrator file as a pdf when the end use of the pdf is unknown? 
</s><s>here's the context: 
i'm designing a logo in for a client who is not currently working with any specific printer and will simply be holding onto the artwork until he's ready to use it.</s><s> since this prevents me from creating a lot of files with end-use in mind, i'm trying to give him a variety of files for high-quality printing so that he's not limited by a single format further down the road.</s><s> i've created ai files and eps files for offset printing, and i would like to provide pdfs as well.</s><s> however, i can't create a pdf to match the specifications of a specific printer (since there isn't one).</s><s> are there optimal settings for a pdf so that it can be modified to suit a variety of outputs at a later date? 
</s><s>are there any other file formats you'd recommend in this situation? 
</s><s>i'm working in illustrator cs4, in u.s web coated swop v.2, and i have access to photoshop cs5 and reader x. the illustrator artwork contains only 3 colours (i have 2 versions- one in process colour and one in pantone), and the colour areas are broad and flat.</s><s> i have no transparency or gradients, and all fonts have been converted to outlines. 
</s><s>any advice would be greatly appreciated!</s><s> i'm an amateur trying to learn more about workflow/prepress, so i'd love to hear your thoughts!

<s>hi!</s><s> 
</s><s>this is my first post here and i've tried to find any previous posts that could answer my question but to no avail.</s><s> also i think and hope this is the correct sub forum to post it in. 
i work at a company that produces a product catalogue that is published as a webpage, a pdf document (used as the basis for a tablet app) and a printed catalogue from a pdf.</s><s> for the pdf (used in the tablet app and the printed catalogue) we are using a cms based on xml that produces adobe framemaker documents which we then export the pdf from.</s><s> we are looking in to updating the system and make it flow much better but are a bit uncertain of what the best way to go would be. 
a solution i'm thinking of would be to have the content of the product catalogue in some kind of xml based service that can export the information in xml.</s><s> this would hopefully make it possible to send the documents either directly to pdf by xml and some style sheets or import the xml into some indesign templates (for the more complicated designs at intro pages etc). 
</s><s>one important aspect of the product catalogue is that we have all information saved in different languages so there has to be some kind of connection between the templates and different language versions -- ie. the page design but different language text flows for each language edition. 
</s><s>what i wonder is.</s><s> what kind of services/solutions would there be that handles xml to pdf for a quite complicated product catalogue (ie. the different language versions)?

<s>the difference between the two packages is that patternstream effectively works on a "pull" principle (the content is retrieved into the template(s) by queries at the appropriate locations), while miramo is a "push" (the tagged content is processed by miramo using templates to create the dtp files).</s><s> since miramo allows programatical processing before the content is pushed into the dtp app, you can do all sorts of manipulations, conditional processing, automatically insert markers and variables, etc. so it allows for a fairly complex layout, even with framemaker.</s><s> it also allows api's and scripts to be triggered at the backend when the publication has been assembled for further processing/manipulation. 
</s><s>is there any particular reason that you want to move from the fm engine to the id one?</s><s> in terms of throughpu,t fm streams run very much faster than id ones.</s><s> also, unless the layouts are extremely complex, in an automated environment, there are very few catalogue layouts that i've seen that couldn't also be handled using a fm workflow. 
</s><s>are there any samples on line of the types of catalogues that you are currently producing?</s><s> this would help in assessing which tools and workflows might be more appropriate to your situation.

depending upon how they send the letters to you and how they expect acrobat to convert them you could be bordering on a license violation that prohibits you from using your version of acrobat as a server-based product.

<s>adobe most strongly recommends use of "save as pdf" from adobe illustrator as opposed to creating pdf via distillation of postscript.</s><s> the postscript generated by illustrator (and for that matter, indesign, photoshop, and acrobat) is optimized for printing to a postscript printer and not for generation of efficient, reliable pdf!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s> 
</s><s>we also recommend subset embedding all fonts referenced in a pdf file.</s><s> given the size of many new opentype fonts with exceptionally large character sets, fully embedding a font can result in useless bloat to a pdf file.</s><s> we know of no good reason for embedding a full font in a pdf file.</s><s> contrary to some popular misconceptions, embedding a full font in a pdf file (a) does not let you edit the text of the pdf file using the text touch-up tool of acrobat using the embedded font itself and (b) does not let you display or edit the text of the pdf file in adobe illustrator using the embedded font.</s><s> (note that adobe does not endorse attempts to edit full pdf files in adobe illustrator which is not a general purpose pdf file editor and can only safely edit pdf files saved from the current or later versions of illustrator using the editability option!</s><s>) 
</s><s>in both (a) and (b) above, you need to have the original font actually installed on the system itself in order to accomplish the edits of (a) or the proper display and edit of (b). 
</s><s>there are some third party tools that claim to support editing of text in pdf using fully embedded fonts, but they don't always work as you might expect.</s><s> when fonts are "fully embedded" in a pdf file, in reality, only the glyph definitions and advance width metrics are embedded, not all the advanced metrics including kerning information and opentype features, severely limiting the functionality and quality of any such text edit functionality. 
</s><s>exactly what use case do you have that you believe really requires fully-embedded fonts?

</s><s>they may be "an iso certified company" but that doesn't mean that they are knowledgeable or follow reliable workflow processes and procedures.</s><s> based upon what they describe on that web page, i would stay very clear of such a printing company and i am sure many other experience graphics professionals would advise you likewise.</s><s> this printing company clearly doesn't know what it is talking about with such misinformation (to put it very mildly) as: 
embedding fonts as subgroups often results in errors in the rip interpretation (exposure process), which results in the absence of special characters and umlauts.</s><s> in addition, it can also cause the displacement of line breaks. 
and 
based on our experience, the following fonts are susceptible to line break displacement or the absence of special characters and umlauts: truetype, multiple master, composite fonts. 
</s><s>the only way this operation could be actually encountering such problems if by some combination of truly ancient rips and pdf workflow software versions and/or professional incompetence!</s><s> their "requirements" are certainly not backed up by their national print trade associations (they are based in germany and their print trade associations are members of the ghent pdf workgroup which absolutely does not subscribe to this arrogant rubbish!</s><s>).</s><s> or maybe they are just believing long-discredited urban legends (the warning against truetype points to that).</s><s> note that pdf is a "final form file format" and as such, it is literally impossible to get what they describe as "displacement of line breaks" based on either the type of font used or whether a font is fully-embedded or subset embedded. 
</s><s>adobe software does not guarantee the ability to fully embed any and all fonts under any circumstance.</s><s> what adobe software does provide is the ability to at least subset embed any font that is not physically protected against embedding (and this isn't an issue of subset versus full font embedding).</s><s> we are not aware of any modern day graphic arts rip (based on adobe rip software or otherwise) or process that has problems with subsetted fonts. 
</s><s>we are sorry that you appear to be stuck with this printing company which based on their so-called requirements, seems to be intent on mediocrity (outlining text is known to produce degraded text output quality, especially at small point sizes and with decorative or complex typefaces) and is likely to cause other problems with their printed output with blame place on fictional bogeymen!

<s>hi, 
</s><s>dov, if you're reading this, i'd appreciate your input, as i readily admit to being novice in print preparation, but i'm also a perfectionist, so my knowledge is growing at least! 
1) i notice that if i use the onlineprinters_v1.4.indd setting from illustrator or indesign (which is pretty much the same as pdf-x 2008, it successfully fully embeds some of the fonts, but arial, and tahoma it only subsets.</s><s> subsetting is apparently not a problem for the printer, so i guess that's ok.</s><s> (previously, when trying to fully embed i had tested using 2001 and 2002.</s><s>) 
</s><s>2) also, in the onlineprinters_v1.4.indd setting file, it is set to output coated fogra39 (iso 12647-2:2004), yet iso coated v2 (eci) is the colour space that the printer wants me to use, and i make my documents in this colour space.</s><s> should i be making my documents using coated fogra39 (iso 12647-2:2004) instead?</s><s> it says "the preset specifices source profiles that don't match the current colour settings file.</s><s> profiles specified by the color settings file will be used".</s><s> i understand this to mean that the onlineprinters preset will be ignored/overruled. 
3) i have images in my files of various resolutions (all of them at least 300dpi, though).</s><s> i notice the compression settings of onlineprinters_v1.4.indd downsamples anything over 600dpi to 400dpi. is it beneficial for me to use images of 400dpi, rather 300dpi, for better quality? - 400 dpi seems like an odd choice to me, as 300dpi is considered the most that is required, due to the human eye's own limitiations etc.. 
4) is it ok if i use images of 1000dpi etc. as they will be downsampled to 400dpi, or is it better to make the images the correct resolution before putting them in the design file? 
5) finally, the setting uses jpeg compression to downsample, at maximum quality.</s><s> i have heard that zip is better.</s><s> the images i am using, bought from stock databases, are originally .jpg images anyway.</s><s> i'm not involved in a super high-end design, using raw photos or .</s><s>tiffs with loads of data in them, so presumably this doesn't matter for me. 
</s><s>thanks, edward

<s>edward, 
</s><s>(1) the fact that they are ok with certain fonts subsetted and others not indicates the true foolishness of their declared requirements. 
(2) if their joboptions file is inconsistent in terms of the specifed output color space from what they declare to be their required color space, it shows how screwed up they are in terms of how they develop and communicate their requirements. 
(3) the reason that we typically don't downsample images unless they significantly exceed the target resolution is that downsampling is in fact a lossy and destructive process.</s><s> images are downsampled at the rip anyway and if you can avoid cascading lossy downsampling operations, you may avoid unnecessary image degradation.</s><s> the values they provide of downsampling anything over 600dpi to 400dpi is fairly odd.</s><s> typical industry practice and experience is that 300dpi is quite sufficient for most high quality offset printing which typically has more exacting requirements.</s><s> i would leave their settings as-is.</s><s> they won't hurt you other than to yield a slightly larger pdf file. 
(4) don't try to artificially upsample or downsample any image before placing into indesign.</s><s> upsampling does not improve quality in any way whatsoever.</s><s> downsampling can lead to the problem of cascading tranformations per (3) above. 
(5) the recommended compression should be automatic (jpeg) with maximum quality.</s><s> images that are photographic in nature will be compressed with jpeg compression and images that are more "vector-like" (i.e., not photographic, but really representing material that would otherwise be done with text and/or vector) are losslessly compressed with zip compression.</s><s> this is the best of both worlds and should be just fine for 99.999% of all pdf production.</s><s> note that adobe applications typically send imagery that is already jpeg-compressed and that doesn't absolutely require downsampling through directly to the pdf file without decompressing and recompressing, a cascading operation that further decreases quality.

</s><s>firstly, the word 'upsampling' makes me shudder.</s><s> i will never do that in my life, ever. 
i.</s><s>) one question about downsampling, though.</s><s> i have .jpg photos that are 600dpi, and 1100dpi etc.</s><s> (because i am placing large .jpg photos in illustrator/indesign, then making them very small in size within indesign/illustrator, thus increasing their full scale dpi of 300, to various dpis far above 300dpi). 
</s><s>if i am too lazy to re-size them to the correct size at 300dpi in photoshop (by creating a blank document at 300dpi, then inserting and re-sizing my photos, and saving), should i just let the pdf downsampling process deal with this?</s><s> or should i not be lazy?</s><s> i ask this question firstly in general, and secondly in this particular case, where all images will be downsampled to 400dpi.</s><s> (who knows what the printer does with my pdfs, but presumably they will reduce the 400dpi images to 300dpi in the correct manner to create a quality output). 
ii.</s><s>) also, about the colour space - am i correct in thinking that the warning from the adobe software ("the preset specifices source profiles that don't match the current colour settings file.</s><s> profiles specified by the color settings file will be used") means that the colour settings i have set in the file (iso coated v2 (eci)) will be used in the pdf, rather than the one in the joboptions (coated fogra39), anyway?</s><s> that's an important thing to know.

<s>take two asprin and call me in the morning ... 
(1) place the images as-is into indesign.</s><s> don't downsample in photoshop prior to placing.</s><s> indesign (actually, more specifically, adobe's core technology libraries) will downsample the images if necessary during the pdf export.</s><s> this isn't a matter of laziness.</s><s> not downsampling prior to placement is actually prudent because it gives you flexibility.</s><s> if you downsample, you are committed to a maximum resolution at highest quality because you have already discarded original image data. 
(2) back to the color issue.</s><s> the cmyk color space specified in the joboptions will indeed be the cmyk color space of the generated pdf file.</s><s> you should be ok with your rgb imagery (hopefully it is tagged with an icc profile) whether or not your joboptions call for conversion of rgb to cmyk or not.</s><s> your untagged cmyk text and vector should be ok.</s><s> depending upon whether you ask for color conversion, no conversion, or color conversion (preserve numbers), you may or may not be ok in terms of some nasty cmyk to cmyk conversions which you typically would like to avoid.</s><s> the color stuff can be quite nasty especially if you have mismatches in the cmyk color space and you don't have the preserve numbers option.</s><s> of course, it also depends upon how critical cmyk color managment is to you (as opposed to rgb to cmyk color management which generally quite critical).</s><s> without actually seeing your color settings, a sample document, and the joboptions, it is very difficult to give you further advice.

a side note: all the images in my document are directly placed srgb files, which upon placement are converted to my working profile and destination profile of iso coated v2 (eci).</s><s> (all image editing is done beforehand in photoshop, so when i put them in my file, i am just adding vector text or shapes to them.</s><s>) i never have any rgb images in my indesign/illustrator designs.</s><s> so my issue is purely one of 'everything is iso coated v2 (eci)' to 'but i need it converted to coated fogra39'. 
2.</s><s> if we assume that coated fogra39 is the colour space my printer wants, but i like to work in iso coated v2 (eci) for use with other printers, what setting should i choose in that joboptions file in indesign/illustrator?</s><s> presumably, "convert (preserve numbers)", because the cmyk numbers i use for the vectors are specifically chosen to reproduce equivalent pantone colours in cmyk process colours (i have the pantone colour bridge coated book), and the photos will be converted into coated fogra39?

<s>looks like this is an old post, but if you change the acrobat version to anything above 4 when exporting from indesign or illustrator, the lines go away.</s><s> i still don't know why the lines appear, but this is what i do for proofing to clients.</s><s> the only downside is that it makes your document no longer 100% x1a compliant.</s><s> but since the white lines don't seem to show up on a commercial press, it should only be an issue with proofing (having to explain the lines to clients).

<s>the n-up print features of acrobat 8 and 9 work very well, but (1) they don't produce a pdf file that can be saved and (2) you have no significant control over how the pages are imposed (such as margins, space between pages, etc.</s><s>) other than whether or not a frame is printed around each page.</s><s> for these purposes, imposition software (such as that from quite software) is really needed. - dov

<s>(1) i created a 4-up pdf from acrobat by printing to the adobe pdf print driver before i posted, so it can easily be done.</s><s> (2) i did not see any info that the op needed the amount of control that quite imposing provided vs. the expense.</s><s> nothing was stated about needing to do a 4-up job for printing-but to simply gang the slides up (possibly for a simple handout).</s><s> both powerpoint and acrobat can do that without additional software.</s><s> unless the op provides more info about the purpose of the 4-up, i still say quite imposing is overkill for this request (based on the info provided).

<s>note that "refrying" pdf to create a new pdf file by printing to adobe pdf is absolutely not recommended by adobe as the postscript output by acrobat (and other adobe applications) is optimized for printing, not for production of pdf.</s><s> furthermore, you lose any live transparency, color management, tagging, etc. that might be in the original pdf file.</s><s> yes, i know that the op didn't mention any specific needs.</s><s> and i am not trying to force the op to license unnecessary software.</s><s> my comments were for general educational purposes.</s><s> i often do either 4-up or 6-up printing of presentations (i use indesign, not powerpoint) and indeed have found that i do need the level of control of page placement and page numbering capabilities not available via acrobat's n-up printing facility. - dov

<s>ok....</s><s> i only just saw this post today, so i'm over a year late in leaving a response.</s><s> but just in case others look at this for help in resolving their own similiar issue, i had to provide the correct solution!</s><s> this has nothing to do with adobe acrobat and you don't need to acquire any extra or special software.</s><s> what you want is very doable and very easy.</s><s> keep in mind that creating pdf files are like creating "print" files.</s><s> so, whatever your print copy will look like, that's what your pdf will be produced of.</s><s> in powerpoint with your presentation open, go to print preview.</s><s> from the top menu, change the print what drop-down to "handouts (4 slides per page)".</s><s> you may also want to check your view % to ensure it's on 100% and the options to be sure you're saving out in color.</s><s> now just click print, and select your pdf distiller/driver.</s><s> bingo....done!</s><s> you should now have a 15 page, 4 slides per page pdf version of the presentation.
