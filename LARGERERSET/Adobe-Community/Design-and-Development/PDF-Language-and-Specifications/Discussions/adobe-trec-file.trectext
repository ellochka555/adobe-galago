<s>text encoding in pdf in essence is for glyph lookup only. 
</s><s>on one end of a processing chain, you have a character code in a text showing operator. 
</s><s>on the other hand you have a glyph in a font. 
</s><s>pdf (and by reference several font specifications) defines several ways how to define (in the code of a pdf file) how certain character codes are - for a given font resource - linked to the font resource and the glyphs in it.</s><s> as there are a number of ways to do this, it can be very confusing for the novice.</s><s> in order to be successful in this field you must fully understand the part of the pdf specification/standard that defines how to put text on a pdf page.</s><s> if there are parts you do not understand yet - keep reading the spec until you understand it.</s><s> there is no silver bullet or magic trick to do text in pdf without this. 
</s><s>it might be true, under certain circumstances, and in many cases coincidentally so, that character codes happen to be equivalent to single byte text codes (as defined winansi, macroman, macexpert encodings, and in addition through a differences array and use of predefined glyph names as defined by agl).</s><s> but it is not smart to hope for this, especially as any of this could - for the purpose of text extraction - be overwritten by a tounicode table (and a character that accoridng to winansi represents "a" would have to be extracted as "b" if the tounicode table says so). 
</s><s>so in the interest of writing better code, forget about the notion that character codes have in any deterministic anything to do with text / unicode code codepoints, single byte or not.</s><s> character codes are just numbers that let you look up a glyph in a font if a certain procedure is followed...

<s>no, this is proceeding from wrong assumptions.</s><s> for all single byte fonts, every pdf contruction deals with 256 values, range 0 to 255. 
</s><s>let's look at what you say.</s><s> you mention two unicode values, and you continue to think that unicode has some importance or meaning in pdf.</s><s> no, it doesn't.</s><s> perhaps your characters are u+0021 and u+fefc but the pdf does not care, and nor should you (when writing the pdf).</s><s> i emphasise: if you are thinking "i will put this unicode value somewhere in the pdf" and you are dealing with page streams/fonts, you are almost certainly not following the spec. 
</s><s>for a single byte font the mapping from the arbitrary codes in the pdf to the internal font structures has one and only one variable: the encoding value.</s><s> the encoding value, if present (and the situations in which it can be omitted are specific and exact), is a shorthand representation for something which will always be an array of 256 names. 
</s><s>since truetype fonts don't contain names, the interpretation of this is complicated for embedded truetype, and you must take care to follow exactly what the spec says.</s><s> other things may sometimes work without being valid, but will probably fail in different software, so stick to the spec exactly. 
</s><s>there is no substitute for endless, deep and repetitive study of the pdf reference.</s><s> it will help if you can phrase your future questions in terms of "what does it mean in the specification when it says...".</s><s> that will help keep you focussed.</s><s> i have been working with the pdf specification for many, many years and i have found that whenever i assume anything, i am almost always wrong.</s><s> read the spec first, second and last.

<s>great, thanks a lot.</s><s> i'd started to make inroads with this yesterday and slowly came to the same conclusion you've helpfully now confirmed! 
i noticed yesterday that the majority of indexed png's i've come across usually only have an array of transparency values consisting of a single 0 with the rest being 255.</s><s> from looking at an existing pdf generator, i realised that when that's the case, you can just pass a single value (instead of the complete array) to add the /mask to an image.</s><s> with that value being the index of the position of the 0 within the png's transparency array.</s><s> this works fine for the majority of indexed pngs that i've tested, as most only elect a single (pixel) colour within their palette to represent a fully transparent pixel and the rest are fully opaque. 
</s><s>so if the png's trn's values are as follows, 
[255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 0] 
then the /mask would be set as 
/mask [6, 6] 
</s><s>after getting this to work, i'd started to think about how this might work with multiple values with varying transparency values.</s><s> but then realised that it would probably just be easier to unroll it and create an image and smask. 
</s><s>out of interest, do you know where i might look to find an example or explanation of how to apply the non-trivial solution?</s><s> is there anything within the pdf reference?

<s>i appreciate your help.  my chrome brower was saying that.   i started this quest of fdf into pdf because i had done it years ago successfully and because the adobe tech support fellow told me that still worked (http://www.myweb.com/abc.pdf#fdf=xyz.fdf ) when i called him last october.  but let me pose the question in a different way  - is there a datafile (any format) that i can use as a parameter to a url that is of a pdf?  xml, flat file, giff format, csv, pipe delimited, etc.   if there is a data file that i can do http://www.myweb.com/document.pdf#inputdata=filex   -or- another way to pose the question - if i'm going from php to browser pdf is there an example of calling the pdf from php where it loads pdf and data values from an outside source.... doing this without involving any other system/package?  just pdf in a browser.   the fdftk library for php is not accessible in my normally used host and also godaddy said they wouldn't load fdftk either.   note: if you go to the last page of this adobe document: http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/acrobat/pdfopenparameter s.pdf you'll see their example http://example.org/doc.pdf#fdf=http://example.org/doc.fdf   thanks!  help!

<s>thanks for that.</s><s> good detailed answer.    i suppose when reading the iso3200-1, the paragraphs above contradict eachother slightly.  first paragraph seems to indicate skipping the initial whitespace though the last paragraph doesn't mention that initial whitespace being relevent to the stream length.    but as you have indicated, the degree of adherence to standards is a little uneven at times so i'm just starting off with the standards and will move forward from there.   it's easy enough to test for whitespace and count the bytes.  i've used a vector for this and have chopped off the whitespace characters where necessary.    i find the iso3200 standard a little unclear in this area.  for example i'll quote below:   the sequence of bytes that make up a stream lie between the end-of-line marker following the stream keyword and the endstream keyword   the end of line marker can consist of a carriage return and a newline or just a newline character.  i interprest this as meaning that if a carriage return and newline are present after the word 'stream' then those combined are the end of line marker in total and should be ignored.  this is because the the data lies between this and endstream.  in all, i just want to know what is it really saying.

<s>with respect, i don't think you can have looked very hard for a solution if you cannot find one which does this.</s><s> however the focus of this group is writing your own code, so.... 
</s><s>the encoding is almost the smallest part of the problem, but the approach is as follows.

<subject>Reading a PDF stream for LZW decompression?</subject>

... /ft/btn /subtype/widget /t(checkbox1) /v (0) /ap <</n <</off 20 0 r /0 21 0 r>>>> /as/off ...

<s>- opm always only can impact devicecmyk vector, text or imagemask objects - it controls whethere these objects migth overprint cyan, magenta, yellow or black - overprint will only happen, if one or more colorant values for the devicecmyk object are 0.0 - it will only kick in if op or/and op are already set to true 
this implies the following: - if op/op are false, it does not mater what value opm has - if op/op are true but opm is zero, a devicecmyk text, vector or imagemask object will always knock out cyan, magenta, yellow and black, even if some or all of the colorant values for the decvicecmyk object are 0.0

<s>1. yes, you need to provide widths and they must be right (a conflict with the font values is bad news).</s><s> it depends what you mean by "easy".</s><s> it's possible to parse each different font type, but hard work, at least for the format i understand (type 1).</s><s> if the font is installed in the system you can use the os to return font metric information for most things.</s><s> stemv/stemh are a particular challenge as the values are not in type 1 fonts.</s><s> it is tough enough for type 1 fonts that the afm format was invented to provide font information in simple text format, and there should be an afm for every type 1 font.</s><s> be sure to retrieve metric information at a very large size to avoid rounding issues.</s><s> if you are working with the base fonts only it's easy enough to generate a table for them.</s><s> ligatures should be no issue at all.</s><s> a ligature is a single glyph with its own metrics.</s><s> you either use the individual characters (so ligatures are irrelevant) or you replace groups with a ligature (at which point it becomes a single glyph to manage).</s><s> there is no automatic conversion of ligatures. 
2.</s><s> this would be in the font, but it would be most unusual to make use of individual glyph's ascent/descent in typesetting layout calculations, as i understand it.</s><s> the important things are (a) use font ascent/descent over the whole line for all fonts and sizes used to ensure there is enough room for characters (b) set each glyph on the same baseline what do you see yourself as doing with the glyph ascent/descent? 
</s><s>if an application generates pdf, then it really must do this stuff.</s><s> word knows all this anyway, because it needs to do the calculations to place text on screen. 
</s><s>please do not try to generate pdfs entirely by hand.</s><s> many people try, but nobody manages to get stream length and xref entries right.</s><s> you cannot rely on pdf readers to repair.</s><s> please write your own software to generate these things.</s><s> pdf is not a text format, even though it has a lot of text in it.

<subject>Generating PDF from a C program. How do I get dimensions of rendered text?</subject>
<post author="Test%20Screen%20Name" timestamp="Jul 30, 2013 3:16 AM">
<s>a tip: if you open a file in adobe reader xi (but not necessarily older versions) and close it, a prompt to save tells you the xref is wrong or the file otherwise needed repairing.</s><s> not an exhaustive test, but a useful trick at the early stages. 
</s><s>another tip: use the c libraries to tell you byte offsets as you write objects etc. then use these to fill in addresses.</s><s> i have seen software which falls over itself trying to count bytes, and it invariably breaks. 
i think it would be in order for a project to support only type 1 fonts with afm files (not amf).</s><s> this was a common requirement until os support of truetype/opentype meant apps could largely ignore the details of fonts. 
i have never known how apps derive stemv/stemh, and whether they do it right.</s><s> the values are used to synthesise replacement fonts if the original isn't there.</s><s> for type 1 fonts it might be derivable from font hints. 
</s><s>type 1 font format and afm file format are somewhere on adobe's site.</s><s> if you are embedding fonts you also need to be aware of the difference between postscript font format, pfb format and pfa format.

<s>there is much scope for simplification if you only have to work for one file for a demonstration or special purpose tool, certainly. 
zlib is the right tool, but your method for finding the start of the stream data is oversimplified; there are specific rules for whitespace following the word "stream". 
</s><s>you should not scan for "endstream"; that is a double check.</s><s> you should read the stream length, which may be a direct or indirect object, and use that.</s><s> be sure only to use the exact stream length - your code would potentially include whitespace before endstream. 
</s><s>also, you don't seem to be using the consolidated xref tables; it is just blind luck (or one file) if the first stream you find is a page stream, it could be anything (e.g.</s><s> a font, metadata, function dictionary...</s><s>) and bear in mind contents could be an array.</s><s> even assuming it is a stream, the word stream could appear in other contexts.</s><s> do not try to find objects by text searching!</s><s>!</s><s>

<s>this problem has been resolved for me for several months now... but not sure which solution fixed it...</s><s> (i know...</s><s> no help there).</s><s> i did do all the corrections listed here.</s><s> but one solution was to make sure you have the most current version of reader.</s><s> and not but doing a software update.</s><s> i haven't looked into why but it seems like they're still patching ver.</s><s> 8 even though ver 9 is out.</s><s> so my computer never downloaded version 9 - and the same was true for the pc's i was working with.</s><s> all seems to be working great now though.

<s>the problem is that i cannot control what version of adobe the person is using who i'm sending the file to.</s><s> this has been hugely embarrassing to me as i've been sending out files with my work.</s><s> some of the recipients were kind enough to point out that the file seems corrupted, others simply put me on a "waste of time" list.   i've tried it on my windows machine, and using acrobat reader 8 and acrobat professional 7.0.</s><s> the text appears as little circles and the file is not readable.   on the mac, i can reproduce the problem, too.</s><s> adobe illustrator (version cs) cannot read the file.</s><s> warnings are:   the font univers-blackext is missing.  affected text will be displayed using a substitute font.</s><s> the font univers-boldext is missing.  affected text will be displayed using a substitute font.</s><s> the font univers-condensed is missing.  affected text will be displayed using a substitute font.</s><s> the font univers-extended is missing.  affected text will be displayed using a substitute font.</s><s> the font univers-extrablackext is missing.  affected text will be displayed using a substitute font.</s><s> the font univers-oblique is missing.  affected text will be displayed using a substitute font.</s><s> to preserve appearance, some text has been outlined.   acrobat 6.0.2 professional cannot read it on the mac   acrobat reader 8.1.7 on mac has no problems with it.</s><s> it displays perfectly, just like under preview.   but this is somewhat beside the point.</s><s> a pdf file should be portable, so once i have one there should be a way to make sure it can be read by all adobe products that can read pdf.</s><s> how can i make sure?   given that i can see everything perfectly on my mac (e.g. using reader 8.1.7), how can i ensure the same can be seen by any other user on any system reading a pdf file?</s><s> i guess that this has to do with your (adobe's) pdf specifications.</s><s> how can i "enforce" those?   many thanks!
