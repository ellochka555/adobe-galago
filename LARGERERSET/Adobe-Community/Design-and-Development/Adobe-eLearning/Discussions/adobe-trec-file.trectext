<s>hello guys, i'm 18 years old student i'm very passionate about brand identity designing, while i was looking through some brand guidelines for some brand, i've noticed that there is something called clear space for the logo, i know that is it used to let the logo breath, but though there's some stuff i didn't get it which is: 
1) is there any other uses for the logo clear space? 
2) how i can calculate it?

<s>that's a bit out of scope for 'elearning', but is certainly a design consideration...</s><s> overall, you don't want anything to appear 'crowded' (unless perhaps that's the look you're shooting for).</s><s> information is quickly lost without proper whitespace (or 'clear space) in all aspects of design.</s><s> you'll surely lose a lot of viewers if their first impression is confusion when looking at a given design...

<s>this isn't the appropriate forum, but let us see if we can see what you are doing and why.</s><s> a pdf preview should not look better than exporting from indesign to pdf.</s><s> this may depend upon your settings file that determines the quality of your export to pdf. 
</s><s>anytime you convert from acrobat or indesign to jpeg, png or tiff you are likely to loose quality.</s><s> this is especially true for jpeg since this is a lossy format (it is designed to lose quality to ensure a smaller file size).</s><s> converting from indesign or acrobat to jpeg, png, or tiff involves a change from a format that includes real fonts and possibly other vector-based information (whose quality doesn't depend on resolution since it is derived from mathematical formulas describing its content) to a raster-based form (jpg, png, tiff) that is solely based upon upon the creation of dots at a certain resolution to create an image.</s><s> when the resolution of the image file is different than the resolution of the viewing medium compromises are made.</s><s> that is the loss you are seeing.

<s>thank you for the replies this answers a question - i too have creative cloud and have inquired to adobe sales multiple times (since i cannot get the same answer as i have been digging on this question) about what is the difference between adding a subscription to captivate 6 versus a subscription to elearning suite 6.1 to what i already own - the creative cloud.</s><s> adobe sales is extremely uninformed about captivate and the elearning suite and the four or five i have chatted with or called (never got a response to my request for more information), they did not know about the roundtripping or could not answer about the muti-sco packaging - two never mentioned the learning extensions that supposedly only come with the suite.</s><s> the last agent said basically the only difference between captivate and elearning suite since i already own creative cloud is presenter ... incorrect! 
</s><s>adobe your salespeople knowledge of this area of your product line is more than disappointing and frustrating.</s><s> adobe buying guides should include a comparison of features - beyond the big cs products - of differences between captive alone and the elearning suite.</s><s> adobe needs to realize that learning developers need creative cloud apps beyond those within the elearning suite and need to quickly account for this possibility - other posts have made this argument more directly. 
</s><s>unfortunately as disappointing and frustrating as this is, i will still use abobe products - though i have dug deeper into alternatives as a result of this - i simply ask in return for the prices adobe is enforcing on learning developers you provide us with sales and support that can answer our questions ... and get captivate, roundtripping, multi-sco packaging and the lot integrated with the creative cloud!

<s>carey, 
</s><s>thank you, i just received your email.</s><s> concerning your statements and questions ... 
i appreciate your diligence in contacting me and i appreciate that you would like to alleviate my frustration.</s><s> i am satisfied to hear that somehow my experience might better train the situation for the next time it comes up, and in particular with that particular representative since i had two bad interactions with her one worse than the other.</s><s> i believe carol tried to do her best, but felt her much too limited in her abilities or authority to be of any service.</s><s> it was a runaround, and what was more disappointing was that apparently her supervisor had stepped in and had not rectified the problem, or even had the courtesy to talk to me directly.</s><s> she left both carol and myself hanging.</s><s> i've been in these situations before where one has responsibility and no authority.</s><s> if you had significant resources at adobe - that might also be looked at.</s><s> i can let that go though too.</s><s> in general though, i think a company as major an educational resource could do better. 
i talked to whoever left the number +36204 on my phone between 12-1 pm central today 8-27-12.</s><s> i believe i talked to the second person, carol, for approximentaly 45 minutes and the conversation was betweeen 1:03 and 1:48 central today 8-27-12. the woman on +36204 did not provide me a name or number, but it had been recorded on my phone.</s><s> for the second outreach, carol, obviously, we emailed ourselves a copy of the transcript verbatem and then left it here as directed our complaints should go.</s><s> in the meantime i tweeted the situation and by chance tj holmes from cnn was asking responding to a situation similiar to this one.</s><s> it was at #trafficlights and also dealt with the issue of posting complaints formally at forums directed by the service provider.</s><s> i made a realization at that time that no one from adobe had appeared to contact any customers at the forum, but then here you are.</s><s> thank you.</s><s> btw - i contributed to the cnn conversation my frustration, but believe i had no impact in the discussion - just the realizatioin that adobe is not the only one to be trying to handle complaints through specific gestures. 
</s><s>the issue i would rather focus on at this point, is your correct, i did want the e-learning suite provided that i can afford it.</s><s> i am a student at jones internatioal university and my student email is [e-mail address removed by moderator.</s><s>].</s><s> please continue emailing me at [e-mail address removed by moderator.</s><s>].</s><s> i don't use the student email for any other purposes than things like this.</s><s> my understanding contrary to the first woman is that you don't offer a student discount which is very unfortunate, because it is obvious those students getting in the teaching field could utilize a reasonably cost(ed) course-building tool.</s><s> i had gotten the cloud service as well and thought i'd already invested so much more into this than i should on a fixed income from disability.</s><s> i'm trying to make better use of me by teaching others with my disability.</s><s> my newly formed business email is here http://newsdidmpd.blogspot.com and my normal blog is at http://annsmultipleworldofpersonality.blogspot.com.</s><s> i am a self-proclaimed advocate for people with dissociative identity disorders. 
i am disabled, but not useless or less intelligent than most.</s><s> please do what you can within reasonable. 
i do want the adobe e-learning software, i do have captivate ... and would rather be using captivate within the e-learning package.</s><s> if there was a refund on captivate that could work into some reasonable cost i would be satisfied. 
</s><s>thank you for looking at these messages.</s><s> it does not leave me feeling so helpless or hopeless with this situation. 
</s><s>our best, ann

</s><s>always our best - thank you again...</s><s> anns

1) click on start -> run -> ncpa.cpl or click on start -> control panel -> add remove programs (program & features for windows vista & windows 7 users) 
2) remove adobe air

4) run that installer (note : make sure you have administrator rights) 
5) once its installer, run adobe elearning suite workflow)

<s>the ridiculous thing is that you don't actually need the old version of air or the elearning link to view the content -- they are just flash files that can be played directly or viewed online on the adobe website (see below).</s><s> it is only the elearning workflows interface that needs the old version of air.</s><s> meanwhile unsuspecting users waste hours of time trying to figure out why this doesn't work, and waste even more time if they seek help from the adobe support team instead of coming here first.</s><s> the adobe support people put you through all kinds of ineffective and irrelevant hoops and act as if they haven't a clue what's wrong with this.</s><s> perhaps they don't, which speaks volumes.</s><s> they keep getting in touch with you to make sure everything is working all right (normally a good thing) when there's no way it's going to work all right with what they've told you to do, and you've already told them you're settling for the workaround!</s><s> two workarounds: first it's important to realise that the only value-added you get from elearning workflows is that they are tutorials.</s><s> they don't give you any added functionality in the programs themselves.</s><s> second, they are flash files with .swf extensions.</s><s> third, they live deep inside a package called main under the root library/application support/adobe/adobe elearning suite 2 workflows/[pick your language].</s><s> right click on main and show package contents.</s><s> now click through contents/resources/resources/workflows (yes that's two levels of resources).</s><s> all the swf files are there.</s><s> click on one and it will run.</s><s> i recommend making an alias to that folder. 
</s><s>alternatively you can go to http://www.adobe.com/products/elearningsuite/workflows/ where you get all the same stuff without some of the fancy intro. 
</s><s>either of these methods works better than downgrading air for this one purpose, especially since air is going to just want to keep being updated foreverafter.

<s>'hi , first of all i think that all the adobe app's are very cool .</s><s>i'm not an expert but im gonna try to answer you. ok a graphic designer tell me a few years ago; the best way to learn is beginning with illustrator ,photoshop, , indesign and then with the others adobe apps that u want to learn. this method works fine for me .</s><s>( remember that all the people learn in diferent ways, you need to figure out which way is better for you.</s><s> )

<s>oh sorry i was pretty vague in my post, let me expand a little. 
i have adobe cs4, i would like to work in commercials making, maybe start a graphic design studio on the long term.</s><s> on the short term maybe work in special effects or animation, and i also like to create websites but i don't know the graphic tools yet. 
</s><s>so looking at this in a medium-long term how should i start learning the programs, since adobe covers most of the tools for all this kind of thing, and i would like to know most of them, maybe i won't be the best at any of them until i found the one i need to use the most depending on the goal i'm working for at the moment. 
</s><s>you have to start somewhere and from there try to go up, so i started with photoshop for graphic manipulation and retouching, so any advice on the matter would be helpful.

<s>"adobe cs4" still doesn't answer the question of what tools you have.</s><s> there's 
</s><s>cs4 design premium cs4 web premium cs4 production premium cs4 master collection 
</s><s>there's other suites too.</s><s> each has a different mix of tools, so even if someone does feel they can give you a "this is the right order" outline (i doubt it, because too much comes down to "it depends"), there's still the need to understand which of the suites you actually have in your posession.

<s>i would say first 
photoshop > raster illustrator > vector 
that way you have the fundamentals down 
then look at what programs are quizzed for adobe certification 
web: dreamweaver, flash 
video: flash, aftereffects, premiere 
print: indesign 
i have the same problem...bursting with creativity and not sure where to start!
