<post author="Jonathan Ferman" timestamp="Jun 22, 2012 10:15 AM">
<s>i wanted to let you know that adobe is working on a brand new 'adobe exchange'.</s><s> it's been written from the ground up and delivers a completely new user and producer experience that overcomes a lot of the issues we heard from existing users and producers of the current adobe exchange.</s><s> we also just released a new tool called the adobe exchange packager which makes it easy to package up your content for the new exchange.</s><s> we plan to have a release on labs in july but if you sign up now you may have time to get your products on the new exchange ready for the public release. 
</s><s>you can learn about the new exchange and some of the tools for creating the content and products for it on this adobe blog: http://blogs.adobe.com/cssdk/ 
you can get the new packager and see the new adobe exchange by signing up for the prerelease at:

we hope to see you on the prerelease!
