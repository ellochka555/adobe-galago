<s>like to know. hey guys, i am new to the internet but not lost, and not so cool too to forums. but i will try to explain what i think about a the site i got www.surfanonymous-free.com its is a freeware that acts like vpn too, but the difference is that it is a software and its ip rotative, while vpn is not. it requires just a simple downloads and installation for a free usage of demo version which is limited in countries.</s><s> i learned from a friend that it was quite good in hiding your ip, or using it anonymously in surfing the internet, he told me that if i can download the software and try to use the demo version, it will help allot in playing internet games and others. then i was so anxious to get into the site. after installing it, i learned it was not quite good as i was told, could it be so because of the demo version i was using?, it was very slow and made me to interrupt my connection thinking it was my lan. but then, i also discovered it has an advantage of renewing ip address in any pr-estimated time u program it to.i think that advantage still has a problem ; what if u manage to get a suitable ip address in progress and u love it, then it just changes to a bad or poor ip address?</s><s> (that would be disastrous). my first experience of using the software was really interesting.</s><s> i learn and felt the difference it will bring to my course (couldn't spot this out), but i believe it was different from other manual ip addresses. still i am kind of in a doubt here (not sure if this will help me, thou my trial v got better in speed later on). one more thing i wouldn't have love about the tool is the fact that i couldn't realize the presence of flocks browser and some other cool browsers too, (firefox is an exception) i downloaded the software from the site: http://www.surfanonymous-free.com/download.html directly, so i believe i ve got all updates.</s><s> i would really love for it to work out with flock browser cus that's my primary browser. in a nut-shell, it was really great in experiencing the tools as in demo, was just thinking of how good it shall be in pro.</s><s> i would like it allot if all the ip's are complying well and more borwsers are caught up with dates. what do you guys think about the site?</s><s>?</s><s>

<subject>Photoshop's File: Automate: Create Droplet: is droplet's function reliable?</subject>
<post author="leo2000ad@aol.com" timestamp="Jul 28, 2011 1:19 PM">
<s>i've just begun using droplets that photoshop creates in its automate submenu (file: automate: create droplet:), and am enjoying the convenience that these droplets afford working with photoshop actions.</s><s> however i have misgivings concerning reliability of the droplets' function, (and hope that  someone, either with technical expertise, or else someone who simply has used the droplets a great deal, can give me some insight).   specifically, my concern is with the kind of the (droplet) application that photoshop is producing with create droplet command, which is kind powerpc (as is indicated in the system profiler).</s><s> my photoshop copy is cs4, its publication date 2008; my operating system is mac snow leopard (v.</s><s> 10.6.8).</s><s> all of the applications that have shipped with my current os, and all of the up-to-date applications that i have installed, are of application kind intel, or else kind universal, and notably powerpc is not present among them.   the architecture of powerpc i know to be rather outdated.</s><s> when i'd purchased my new mac pro computer (intel based), all of application scripts which i wrote with applescript editor on my old powermac computer, were dysfunctional when copied onto the new computer, and needed to be rewritten or discarded.</s><s> (kind of these problematic applications was powerpc.</s><s>)   don't wish to be fanatical, (and i realize that the droplets may actually work just fine).</s><s> still my dread is a scenario, working with droplets, that they (may) produce error in my graphic design files, and when sent to the printer could cause trouble, subsequently trying to look at where the problem is, droplets would never occur to me as source of trouble, and a means to fix be quite evasive.   leo.

1.</s><s> first of all, it seems to always want to load something else with it - the default setting is to also download and install mcafee, chrome etc. - you need to un-select it if you don't want it.</s><s> i thought that by now the world has learned that this kind of default options is politically wrong!</s><s> i don't wan to see adobe engaging in it, regardless of how much extra revenue it may bring.</s><s> it is wrong.</s><s> the screen could ask politely "would you also like to try this or that?" and the default setting should be no. 
2.</s><s> after downloading it, tried to run it - it wants me to close my browser.</s><s> it is not convenient for me to do that now so i decide to postpone the whole process.</s><s> i go to the place where the download resides, and try to delete it.</s><s> it doesn't let me!</s><s> it wants a password!</s><s> now adobe is not letting me simple delete its download on my own computer? 
3.</s><s> this is my first time on these forums.</s><s> the process of getting here was really difficult, time consuming, and extremely unfriendly.</s><s> i could not find a place to simply go and file a complaints.</s><s> i could not set up an account on the forums without going through a lot of hoops, requiring me to register some product etc.</s><s> i ended up chatting with a support person who did me a big favour and set me up - i still don't know if i could have done this on my own.</s><s> i am a highly experienced and intelligent user, i have been around forever, been there and done that, seen untold number of sites and forums, and i am telling you - this place is not nice and friendly.</s><s> again, if this company is going to continue to thrive, it must change or else run a chance of losing it all to somebody else who will. 
</s><s>everything here smacks of the kind of attitude that has brought many companies down.</s><s> i don't want to see if happen here.
