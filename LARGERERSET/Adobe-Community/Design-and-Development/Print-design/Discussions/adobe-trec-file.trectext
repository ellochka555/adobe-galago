<subject>Offset Printing Question</subject>
<post author="generalbatzorig" timestamp="Jan 23, 2012 5:34 AM">
<s>hello, i need an advise on how to print a very deep blue color on offset printing.</s><s> i am doing a catalog for an artist who uses very nice deep blue color.</s><s> his technique of applying the color is very special, so when seen with human eye it is very illuminating.</s><s> professional photo can capture the effect decently, but numerous trials on different publications show that offset printing can't get anywhere close to the original color by the artist.</s><s> sometimes it gets muddy grayish blue, but sometimes it gets more to the purple side with a lot of magenta in it.</s><s> if you are curious what kind of art i am talking about, you may visit www.chimeddorj.com the reason is that cyan, magenta and a bit of black can't really create a pure cobalt blue.</s><s> so i was thinking if there was a way to add an additional printing separation for a pure blue color from pantone.</s><s> that way the spot pantone blue that is closest to the artist's color will act as a base and cmyk color will add necessary shades depending on the situation.</s><s> does it sound reasonable?</s><s> does any one think it will work?</s><s> i need your opinions or expertises.</s><s> also, do you know any other web sites with forums specifically dedicated to commercial print topics?

<s>the best thing you can do is use printed color reference guides, whether it be pantone or toyo.</s><s> use an actual guide book swatch to compare which pantone ( or whatever specialty ink supplier ) color comes closest to the artists actual print ( not the monitor ).</s><s> you are correct in recommending a spot color instead of process color on press.</s><s> however, process inks on press are semi-transparent and spot colors are opaque.</s><s> so, they cannot be mixed on press without creating a real mess.

<s>hi, i am back after quite a long time.</s><s> i am still considering to make the fifth color on the book that i am designing.</s><s> as you read from the previous posts, the main reason for the fifth color is to imitate the artist's color and technique as closely as possible.</s><s> you may see the sample images here. Ê http://www.flickr.com/photos/batzorig/sets/72157629499492596/ Ê if you notice, the blue color of each painting is different from others.</s><s> although the painters original canvases use more consistent shade of blue, the photos were taken by different people in different environments.</s><s> so the blues look a lot different than they really are.</s><s> and rgb color represents these blues a little better than offset printing.</s><s> so my main concern was how to print the blue color as close to the original as possible.</s><s> one of the strength of this artist is his blue color.</s><s> and if i don't show his blue effect on the catalog, i am not representing him correctly.</s><s> the blue colors in the paintings are not made of solid application but with a technique that makes it translucent like watercolor with delicate nuances with much more strength than watercolor.

</s><s>i hope everything is well with you.</s><s> i know that you are one of the most active participants of the adobe forums.</s><s> i would like to ask your help on a pretty complicated photoshop problem.</s><s> i thought you may have some experience printing in solid colors and separating them into channels.</s><s> i am trying to print a book using two solid colors in addition to the 4 process colors.</s><s> but the solid colors will not be applied just plainly.</s><s> the photographic images will have certain areas printed in solid colors that will diffuse smoothly with other 4 colors.</s><s> if you would like to get a better understanding of my problem, you could visit my previous post on adobe forums under these links.</s><s> you have added your entry on the second link almost a year ago. http://forums.adobe.com/message/5929818#5929818 http://forums.adobe.com/thread/953122

<s>hey everyone, i've been using adobe indesign cs5 and apple's aperture software together (on a mac) to do design projects over the past year and a half or so.</s><s> i'd never been that interested in adobe's other applications until recently, when i got a creative cloud membership, and now am reveling in the bounty of creative possibilities.</s><s> recently i've been interested in integrating bridge into my workflow and transitioning away from aperture to lightroom (as i imagine many other people are considering/in the process of doing right now).</s><s> i've been taking some video tutorials on lynda.com and recently came across terry white's "bridge cc vs. lightroom" youtube screencast (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8xlyg8a0s#t=20).</s><s> while i really appreciated terry's perspectives and find them helpful, i think he polarized the "design" (bridge) and "photography" (lightroom) paradigms that he used to distinguish the programs: bridge is a file browser for working numerous file types across creative cloud applications, whereas lightroom is a tool for photographers to do powerful non-destructive edits. 
</s><s>part of what i've liked about using aperture with indesign is that (however buggy this feature is) i can directly access my aperture library from within the os x open dialog box, thus allowing me to use files that i've edited and keeping all my work in one library.</s><s> however, from what i've learned so far, and what terry's video didn't (directly) address is what are some good practices for using edited photographs within an application such as indesign.</s><s> it seemed in the video he simply exported image files from lightroom into folders, and then i suppose you could use mini-bridge to browse that folder.</s><s> but i'm wondering if there isn't a better or simpler way to do this, and i'm wondering if i could solicit opinions from folks as to how they work between everything i've tried to do in my workflow is minimize steps and keep track of the proliferation of images i work with.</s><s> as much as i see that lightroom is a better maintained tool than aperture, it sure is nice to be able to directly access those image files from within indesign-

<s>the reason why most applications and pdf workflow products have eliminated the ability to set screening information is very simple.</s><s> most modern direct pdf as well as postscript rips and dfe (digital front end - a rip for a digital press) totally ignore any screening information and do their own proprietary screening, often using unconventional techniques such as fm (frequency modulation) screening to obtain results that are perceived to provide better detail and tones.

<s>there's not enough space here to explain everything you need to know.</s><s> but, there are some things you can do to improve your situation.</s><s> one major problem with the computer is the deception of the color monitor and what is shows you vs. what you get back from the printer.</s><s> most people starting out work with this deception and disappointment. 
</s><s>"if you know the characteristics of the press, you can specify the highlight and shadow output to preserve certain details." 
</s><s>this is important, but it is only one piece to the puzzle.</s><s> other important things to consider are the type of paper to be used on that press.</s><s> what adobe is saying in the quote is, some presses can hold a 2% dot ( highlight ) and a 93% dot ( shadow ).</s><s> your color setting in photoshop controls dot gain which is also important.</s><s> other things to look for in photoshop images is the file's original rgb profile.</s><s> most printers want you to color correct and convert the images to cmyk.</s><s> this is also important because you can minimize such things as color casts, low contrast, and total ink limits. 
</s><s>there is also the seduction of sending rgb files and letting the rip do the conversions.</s><s> somewhat mediocre attempt at automating the process.</s><s> i recommend against any type of automated workflow.</s><s> as a designer you've become the point person on production ( whether you like it or not ).</s><s> you are responsible ( you knew that already, i know ) for the final product getting to the customer the way they expect it and in most cases, beyond their expectations.</s><s> here's what i would recommend at this point: 
1.</s><s> get "adobe print publishing guide"; it will give you some of the parameters i mentioned above and also discusses other print methods. 
2.</s><s> you cannot, in some cases, pre-determine the press characteristics on every job.</s><s> the key is predictability of your workflow.</s><s> sorry to say, but approving a "soft-proof" on screen is not part of predictability.</s><s> so, at a minimum, calibrate your monitor ( if you haven't already ).</s><s> first and foremost, do not rely on your monitor, even a calibrated one. 
3.</s><s> get a contract proofer in-house.</s><s> this is a major investment that allows you to proof image files before they go to the printer and also are used as part of the file turnover process working with the printer.</s><s> if the print vendor receives a contract proof with the disk, many questions can and will be answered upfront and will save you money. 
4.</s><s> get used to the terms dpi and ppi.</s><s> dpi refers to output resolution.</s><s> a good direct-to-plate output device will require a 5080 dpi as standard.</s><s> ppi refers to image resolution and raster resolution.</s><s> typical file ppi = 72ppi ( low ); 150ppi ( med ); and 300ppi ( high ) resolution. 
5.</s><s> there is also a belief that cmyk is the only print process.</s><s> on the contrary.</s><s> take a look at silk screen and spot color printing technologies. 
</s><s>do not become overwhelmed with all of this information at once.</s><s> it takes years of experience to become fully capable of producing catalogs, magazines, and other printed products successfully.</s><s> add to that that many print vendors do not have the answers.</s><s> you have to find them on your own.</s><s> find a local shop that will allow you to intern a few hours a week.</s><s> this will prove very valuable in that you will learn quickly what is required to get the job done right the first time.</s><s> the key is finding a good shop that has a really good prepress department that really know what they are doing.</s><s> hope this helps, let me know either way.

<s>i'm sure there are many sources for inspriation, but i stumbled across this not too long ago: http://www.makebetterflyers.com/ 
as for which is better, illustrator or indesign, i would not use illustrator if there were a lot of text.</s><s> as pointed out if you're comfortable with illustrator use that.</s><s> you might try doing the text in indesign though... maybe you'll find you like it better!

<subject>The best way to enlarge an image for print?</subject>
<post author="Not_Happy_With_Adobe" timestamp="Nov 2, 2012 7:06 AM">
<s>hello 
</s><s>i've been designing for print for several years.</s><s> occasionally i design large display posters/banners (a0, 6-sheet, billboard etc) which use a photographic image.</s><s> assuming that the image i have is smaller at 300ppi than the final print, what is the best way to enlarge the image?</s><s> based on my experience, it seems that there are three options (to make it simple, the example here assumes that my image is exactly half the size it needs to be printed at.</s><s> i'm also assuming that the file i will supply to the printer will be a high res pdf exported from indesign): 
1.</s><s> set up the indesign file at 100% size, place the photo and have indesign upscale the image to 200%.</s><s> export a high res pdf for print. 
2.</s><s> set up the indesign file at 50% size, place the photo with no upscaling by indesign.</s><s> export a high res pdf and have the printer blow it up to 200%. 
3.</s><s> set up the indesign file at 100% size, enlarge the photo in photoshop to 200%, and place the photo with no upscaling in indesign.</s><s> export a high res pdf for print. 
i have been advised that having indesign upscale the image is not a good idea, and i never do this.</s><s> i guess that option 3 is probably best, with photoshop doing the work and the resulting pdf being the correct size.</s><s> however, it's not always possible to do this Ð some posters are huge which means that the enlarged photo and the high res pdf will both be huge files, and i think also indesign has a maximum document set up size anyway.</s><s> so sometimes i use option 2. 
</s><s>so firstly, why is it a bad idea for indesign to upscale the image (as i say, i never do this, but i would like to know the technical reason)?</s><s> secondly, if the choice is between re-sizing myself in photoshop prior to exporting the pdf, or having the printer enlarge a high res pdf, which is better?</s><s> when i say 'better' i mean in terms of the quality/sharpness of the end result.</s><s> also, i assume that vector elements in my design will not be adversely affected in either scenario, is that assumption correct? 
</s><s>thanks

<s>this is a common question, so you're definitely not alone.</s><s> i use option #2.</s><s> i prefer to use illustrator, but indesign is ok, too.</s><s> indesign's document resolution is set in the print dialog ( if i'm not mistaken ).</s><s> you assume vector elements really do not matter.</s><s> that's not entirely true.</s><s> your document / raster resolution should be setup as high res.</s><s> this will allow you to avoid "flatness" issues that show-up in lower to mid res documents.</s><s> that aside, i setup my banner and grand format files at 25% with placed images resolution set for 300ppi ( document res set for 2540dpi ).</s><s> then, i use distiller to create a high res ( press ready ) pdf at the 25% size and indicate to the printer to enlarge the file 400% which yields an image res of 75ppi and an output res ( document ) of 635dpi.</s><s> indesign and illustrator should have images placed at the correct resolution in order to holdup to the enlargement.</s><s> i prefer to use distiller because it allows me to create my own settings.</s><s> you can probably do that in the conversion through the application.</s><s> just remember to apply enough res in the document so you do not encounter any line stepping issues, jaggies, and, you know, lines that do not render smooth ( i.e., stepping ).</s><s> recently i created a 3' x 8' banner at 12.5% ( because of image res issues ).</s><s> i placed the image at 600ppi and then enlarged the illustrator document 200% for a scaled down version at 25%.</s><s> the file will still holdup to enlargement because the pre-enlarged image file's res is 300ppi.</s><s> the original 12.5% document res was set for 5080dpi; with the 200% pre-enlarged file's new document res re-set at 2540dpi.</s><s> all of the transparency effects and typography holdup as they should.

<s>john, thanks for the reponse.</s><s> i'm afraid you have confused me further, clearly i have gaps in my knowledge!</s><s> you talk about setting the 'document resolution' in indesign or illustrator Ð i had no idea that this was possible, and looking at both programmes, i cannot find where to define this.</s><s> i suppose i had always assumed that as dpi refers to printing, this would be determined by the printer at their end, and not specified in the document provided by me?and that as long as i provide a document with high resolution images (in terms of ppi) then there would be no problem with the printing.</s><s> obviuously, i assume too much!</s><s> perhaps it is because i'm not using distiller (i export pdfs directly from indesign) Ð you suggest that using distiller gives you more options?

<s>sorry for the added confusion.</s><s> it appears, after doing some checking in my cs2 apps ( indesign), there is no setting for dpi / output resolution.</s><s> only transparency flattener setting.</s><s> see screen shot below... 


</s><s>if you select postscript file in the print presets, you can access resolution settings for transparency flattening there, too... 


in the "advanced" tab dialog... 


</s><s>but, i like having the option in illustrator 10 file > document setup where i can set the output resolution to whatever is appropriate.</s><s> in this case ( below ) i've got it set for 5080dpi / 300ppi.</s><s> you also have effect > document raster effect setting where you can select 300ppi ( see screen shot below )... 


...and raster effects resolution setting... 


i may have misled you because the apps i have are not cs6; but you should be able to follow along in your cs6 apps in various settings dialogs.</s><s> mainly, resolution settings can be set in the print dialog boxes. 
</s><s>the main thing to keep in mind is, because you are enlarging upon output, the base scaled down file must have enough resolution to maintain its appearance at the final size.</s><s> in the case of 50% or 25% file resolution should be maximum ( for current apps it appears 300ppi is considered high resolution.</s><s> most apps now leave output resolution setting adjusted in the rip / print driver. 
i still use distiller because it allows me to setup custom pdf settings and save them for future use.</s><s> you very well may be able to do that in cs6 apps; but i have a tried-and-true workflow that utilizes distiller as a personal preference.
