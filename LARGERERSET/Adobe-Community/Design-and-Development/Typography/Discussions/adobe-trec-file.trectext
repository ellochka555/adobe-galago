<s>hi, 
</s><s>i have a question concerning the commercial usage of the fonts incorporated in illustrator.</s><s> is it legal to use them (after converted into outlines) for creating stock vectors and then selling them on stockphotos/designs web pages?</s><s> if i have purchased the product itself, do i have to purchse also the embedded fonts separately in order to create files for commercial purposes?</s><s> i would be grateful if you could provide me a clear and concreate answer.</s><s> i have been searching for a month to get a response and i haven't found it yet.</s><s> thank you very much for your precious help.

<s>i will assume that by "fonts incorporated in illustrator" you actually mean fonts that are installed by adobe as part of the installation of illustrator.</s><s> my response also applies for any other fonts licensed from the adobe type library directly from adobe. 
</s><s>you may use and embed fonts using illustrator, indesign, and photoshop pdf and eps output file formats without any restriction.</s><s> that includes embedding them in files that you license to others.</s><s> you don't need to outline or rasterize the text to remain legal.</s><s> in fact, outlining degrades output quality since you lose "intelligent scaling" provided by the font technology and font definitions with result of overly bold and blotchy looking text at low magnifications and resolutions.</s><s> rasterizing is even worse since the results are tied to a particular resolution. 
</s><s>what you may not do is to sell artwork in .</s><s>ai (illustrator), .</s><s>indd (indesign), or any one of the photoshop formats with layers preserving live text and include the fonts as separate files.</s><s> (you obviously could distribute such source files without the fonts and point your customers to where to license them!</s><s>) 
</s><s>clearly, the best option in terms of output of your artwork and designs for resale would not outlining or rasterizing text and saving or exporting as pdf (either pdf/x-4 or high quality print options) maintaining color management and live transparency (if used). 
- dov 
ps: this advice with regards to fonts may or may not apply to fonts sourced elsewhere.</s><s> you must read the eula (end user license agreement) associated with the fonts you plan to license.</s><s> some may allow embedding but require royalties for the distributed pdf or eps files that have the fonts embedded.</s><s> some prohibit outlining or treat outlining the same in terms of restrictions as embedding the font itself.</s><s> and some have similar restrictions on rasterization.</s><s> check such terms before you license a font!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s> yes, you must read the licenses!

<subject>Differences between /FontFile2 and /FontFile3, or OS X Preview?</subject>
<post author="djkemper" timestamp="Dec 5, 2013 9:50 PM">
<s>(this is my first post in these forums, so apologies if this topic is not appropriate.</s><s>) 
</s><s>i've written a pile of java utility code to generate pdfs with subsetted truetype fonts using a cid-keyed font.</s><s> (i know: there are multiple frameworks that do this type of thing.</s><s> but i'm a hobbyist tinkerer who enjoys building things, and i'm enjoying learning how these technology stacks hang together.</s><s>) 
</s><s>my code creates a font descriptor with a /fontfile2 reference to my truetype font program output stream.</s><s> the subsetted font always has the .notdef glyph at glyphindex 0, with subsetted glyphs thereafter as they are first referenced.</s><s> i'm using an identity mapping of cid==glyphid.</s><s> (i've been reading the various specs... the iso pdf 1.7 reference, truetype and opentype specs at microsoft and apple, and several adobe tech notes on various font and cmap technologies.</s><s>) 
</s><s>all this seems to work. 
</s><s>however i'd like to also explore opentype fonts with glyphs in a 'cff ' table (cidfonttype0 instead of my cidfonttype2), and in preparation i'm trying to adapt my current truetype-based code to opentype using a /fontfile3 reference. 
</s><s>that's where the wheels fall off the train.</s><s> since i'm still dealing with 'glyf'-based fonts, i expected minimal changes, e.g., switching the font file dictionary key and putting the /subtype -> /opentype wrapper on the font stream itself. 
</s><s>adobe acrobat renders the resulting pdf just fine, and preflighting didn't bring up any errors (though possibly i'm not using acrobat right).</s><s> however os x preview under mavericks scrambles my glyph mapping in a way that i can't mentally reverse engineer.</s><s> i've tried tweaking things, but i'm stuck. 
</s><s>so my questions are: if your font subset is a truetype-based cid font with 'glyf' outlines using /fontfile2, what changes are necessary to make an equivalent opentype font using /fontfile3?</s><s> and/or does mavericks preview support pdfs with /fontfile3 and 'glyf'-based opentype fonts?</s><s> i think the odds are with me misunderstanding aspects of the specifications, and it's also possible that my /fontfile2 code is also broken in a way that (un)fortunately is forgiven by both acrobat and preview. 
(i have two "equivalent" pdf examples of what my code generates that i can try to attach if this topic gets any traction.</s><s>)

<post author="David%20W.%20Goodrich" timestamp="Dec 6, 2013 11:32 AM">
<s>i think the key lies in "os x preview under mavericks scrambles my glyph mapping." my grasp of font internals is pretty shallow, but i am pretty sure an author recently screwed up the coding for pdf proofs for a book simply by using preview to add comments -- meaning preview saved the pdf and in doing so re-processed the font tables: ascii survived, but words containing the fi and fl ligatures were no longer searchable (the file-size also shrank significantly).</s><s> you will find many criticisms of preview down the hall on the acrobat and indesign forums, though i don't recall any that mention this aspect. 
</s><s>in fact, the inner workings of fonts don't come up too often on these forums -- not the place to find out about mark-to-mark-positioning, for example.</s><s> you might want to check out the build forum over on typophile, though the site has had speed/connection issues lately.</s><s> i've also picked up useful information lurking on typedrawers.com.

<s>hello, Ê the epub format supports - as you may know - the css2 @font-face, butÊ adobe's fonts aren't directly embeddable that rule.</s><s> at the moment, there are not faqs or license terms specifically writtenÊ for epub (or other kind of ebook formats) so i'm going to refer to theÊ currently available documents i found on the web.</s><s> a typblography blog postÊ (http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2010/10/web-font-licensing.html)Ê clearly describes the difference adobe sets between "embedding" andÊ "serving" a font.</s><s> epub format - unfortunately - lies in a sort of no man's land, becauseÊ it is a zipped container of browsable documents (xhtml files,Ê stylesheets, images, fonts), so it can be considered a self-containedÊ and portable document, but at the same time, it doesn't protect theÊ fonts from unauthorized use.</s><s> also the adobe font licensing faqsÊ (http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/antipiracy/ff_faq.html) partiallyÊ clarify the field of discussion.</s><s> the adobe's proprietary font obfuscation feature, supported by adobeÊ digital editions, can be easily overridden with few lines of python code.</s><s> adobe doesn't allow for @font-face embedding but let authors access toÊ use its fonts via specialized web font services such as typekit.comÊ which can't be used by epubs because of its offline nature.</s><s> my questions are: can i use an adobe licensed font (i.e.</s><s> minion pro) in anÊ epub ebook using @font-face?</s><s> what kind of license or agreement should beÊ used?</s><s> is there a dedicated contact for licensing-related issues (the font-licensing@adobe.com address just bounces back)?</s><s> indeed, i can already download some epubs featuring the minion proÊ typeface.</s><s> i.e: "il fu mattia pascal" edited by mondadori (the most important italian publishing company) and freelyÊ downloadable from the lafeltrinelli storeÊ (http://www.lafeltrinelli.it/products/9788852013089/il_fu_mattia_pascal /luigi_pirandello.html).</s><s> that makes me confident that an arrangement is possible, isn't it?</s><s> i hope to hear soon from you, as i'm writing also on behalf of someÊ others italian ebook designers.</s><s> thank you, matteo balocco

<s>the issue is really not word, but the keyboard driver for hebrew included with windows and vista.</s><s> word has been 'smart' or compatible with typing nikkud since word 2000.</s><s> i use a mac which is little more intutive than windows or vista, like doing most things.</s><s> on windows or vista, i think you simply type in your hebrew text after choosing a truetype or opentype with unicode hebrew with nikkud font, and the hebrew keyboard .dll driver.</s><s> then, you go back to add the nikkud, bt pressing down the capslock key, and typing different number keys from the top level of your keyboard.</s><s> really stupid.</s><s> likely, a non-hebrew programmer created this; as they say, "goyishe kupp." if you have a non-unicode hebrew font, it won't work, and most commercial hebrew fonts are non-unicode. :) if that wasn't bad enough, most windows and vista computers are noy enabled for hzebrew. :) if this is the case, call gohebrew or www.gohebrew.com.

<s>yes, with the latest version of davkawriter you can cut and paste directly into indesign including teamey mikra!</s><s> you don't need word.</s><s> in terms of intuitivity, i think that both windows and the mac have developed so much that i'm not sure you can say that any more.</s><s> case in point, i used to work on the mac from os6 to os9, i then migrated to pc.</s><s> i'm now using vista on the pc.</s><s> we have a couple of macs in the office running osx and everytime i have to use it i curse.</s><s> why?</s><s> coz i'm no longer use to it and do the most simple of operations like moving files or accessing things on the network (something that i always found easier on the mac) i now find much much harder simply because i don't know it any more.</s><s> doing things on vista is incredibly intuitive for me, but that's because i've been on windows for years now and i think that's the main point.</s><s> if you want hebrew on vista (or chinese) it's the same easy procedure, hit the windows key, type control panel, type language, select change keyboards or other input methods, and i'm the right place along with a help dialogue the whole way through.</s><s> don't get me wrong, the mac is great, but try doing hebrew in word on the mac and you are stuck, since word on the mac (to the best of my knowledge) doesn't support full hebrew which for typesetters like myself who use word for preparing text before typesetting in indesign cs 3 me, is a bit of a problem.</s><s> and of course great programs like davkawriter don't work on the mac either.</s><s> so for us guys typesetting in hebrew, whereas once upon a time, the mac was supreme with hebrew versions (of sorts) of pagemaker, quark, and freehand (not to mention rav daf), with nisuswriter and kesherim.</s><s> today, however, your best platform for hebrew is of course windows mainly because of the support software around adobe me products which are biplatform (ie word, davkawriter etc).

<s>dominic, i certainly sympathize with the problems.</s><s> i believe that international software distribution licensing depends a lot upon the quirks of dealing with third parties in countries where, everything from business customs and local laws to financial resources and product availability all conspire to work against the consumer.</s><s> i don't claim to know anything about real-world software product distribution.</s><s> but just thinking about it for a moment, one solution for many end users might be -- if it were possible to overhaul the entire distribution scheme -- for local distributors to have exclusive distribution only for local mail order or in-store placement of physical product, along with product support for just what they sell; but that downloads and international mail order could still be easily, economically and/or legally obtained from the same distribution streams as are readily available to americans, with support through these forums or with contact with adobe usa. it might also prompt the local distributors to take a more aggressive marketing, sales and support track to the benefit of their local customer base.</s><s> on the other hand, such a scheme might backfire, and the local distributors might simply give up the market rather than compete.</s><s> i'm sure that there are many factors that i've overlooked...</s><s> but at least the non-usa located end user would have the comfort level of knowing that he doesn't have to wait weeks or months for products.</s><s> or pay some hefty premiums to obtain the software.</s><s> apologies for dragging this topic further away from the original post....</s><s> neil

<s>here are your options.</s><s> note that some of the commercial applications have a free demo version, but the limitations of the demo may be too great for your needs.

</s><s>typetool: $99, the "low end" tool from the makers of fontlab studio, same interface etcetera.</s><s> probably your best choice if you might want to get serious later on, although not terribly easy to use.

<s>you asked for something 'good' and also 'inexpensive'.</s><s> in general, you can't have both. 
</s><s>the two suggestions you've received so far include one good and expensive solution (fontlab) and one poor and inexpensive (corel draw). 
</s><s>corel draw's font creation process is absurd!</s><s> it does one character at a time and has just about zero ways to select or create any other than a couple of default font attributes. 
</s><s>an exception to the rule is fontforge, which is both good and free.</s><s> it also has a steep learning curve, and requires a cygwin environment. 
</s><s>somewhere in between, you can find: 
other programs from pyrus/fontlab, with varying costs and degrees of capability, including typetool and scanfont.</s><s> scanfont does a reasonable job of vectorizing images of full character sets, but should really be used in conjunction with fontlab.</s><s> they also own and sell fontographer, an expensive old warhorse of a program that hasn't been updated in many many years.</s><s> the mac version is a bit newer. 

</s><s>fontcreator (high-logic systems).</s><s> extremely flexible when vectorizing images of individual glyphs.</s><s> it has poor defaults (such as assigning the copyright to high-logic systems and creating many hundreds of empty glyphs) that have to be overcome.</s><s> again, post-processing with a program like fontlab is recommended, but not necessary. 
</s><s>cr8 software solutions: has a free font creator, typelight, that has limited drawing tools, can't import scanned images directly, and other limitations.</s><s> he also offers a paid version with significantly more capability, and a separate program cr8trace, for vectorizing scanned images.</s><s> all in all, not great, but you get what you pay for.

<s>thomas, i very much appreciate your concern.</s><s> i'm using windows xp professional, service pack 2.</s><s> i ordered cs2 premium as soon as it was announced, as an ungrade to my cs premium suite.</s><s> i did a full install of the cs2 premium without deleting any of the cs premium which is still on my system.</s><s> i suspect that rather than this being an installer problem, it's an internal communications mix-up within adobe concerning what is and is not included in cs2 premium.</s><s> if i'm mistaken, then the next logical question is: has anyone on this forum gotten bickham with their cs suite?

<s>michael, i have already cleared up the general issue with customer support, by contacting a high-level support manager and making sure that the support reps are henceforth pointed to a copy of the document i posted at the top of this forum, and/or the web page here: http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/type.html (both of which list bickham script pro).</s><s> now, that doesn't explain why you can't find it.</s><s> i'm chatting with people on the installer engineering and customer support ends to see who we can put on the case to look into it.</s><s> regards, t

<s>we had somebody spend a few hours looking into this.</s><s> he found that on windows only, if bickham script pro and/or warnock pro is deleted after install, further installs won't get them back.</s><s> it seems only a complete uninstall and then reinstall gets them back.</s><s> sorry for the delay in posting this.</s><s> i lost track of the thread.... * * * * * details i did some playing around with the cs2 installer and found something interesting that might be related to some customers not finding bickham script pro or warnock pro.</s><s> on both the macintosh and windows platform, using the suite installer to install even one app from the suite (e.g., golive) installed bickham and warnock--no surprise.</s><s> on the macintosh, if i manually deleted those fonts files from the application support: adobe: fonts folder, then used the creative suite installer to install another application from the suite (e.g., photoshop), those fonts got reinstalled--again, pretty much as i would have expected.</s><s> on the windows side, however, if i manually deleted those font files from the program files\common files\adobe\fonts folder, then installed another app (e.g., photoshop), the fonts did not get reinstalled.</s><s> even more interesting, if i manually deleted the entire fonts folder from program files\common files\adobe, then used the creative suite installer to install an application from the suite (e.g., i removed photoshop, deleted the fonts folder, then reinstalled photoshop) the fonts folder got reinstalled as did the reqd folder inside of it (and the contents of the reqd folder) but bickham script and warnock pro were not reinstalled.</s><s> on a fresh machine, i tried using the suite installer to install only photoshop from the suite, just to make sure it actually installs bickham and warnock, and it does.</s><s> i then removed bickham and warnock and installed golive with the suite installer--still no bickham or warnock.</s><s> then i installed acrobat with the suite installer--still no bickham or warnock.</s><s> if i use add/remove to completely remove all creative suite applications and support files and preferences, then reinstall an app, i do get warnock and bickham.</s><s> his theory: on the windows platform, if customers are removing those fonts, or for whatever reason they don't get installed in the first place (though i couldn't reproduce a problem here), they may not get the fonts unless they do a full removal of the entire creative suite package (all applications) before reinstalling.

<s>thanks, thomas, and whoever did the testing!</s><s> my recommendation would then be to do a backup of all newly installed fonts -- just in case and -- to prevent "losing" these fonts.</s><s> ideally, i would want control over the installation of any new fonts (which, when and where), rather than have an application installer make the decision (rightly or wrongly) for me.</s><s> from your description, i see a possibility of fonts being installed twice, causing font conflicts, if you should move your fonts to some location other than the default installation.</s><s> neil

<s>in a client's typical installation - resulting from some separately purchased fonts, a number of adobe product installations followed by uninstalls and/or upgrades, what they have is a mess.</s><s> under /program files/common files/adobe there's an assortment of font folders: \pdfl\ with three subdirectories, 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0, each with a cmaps folder and a fonts folder, containing some duplicates, some unique. \fonts\ with the new cs2 otf fonts in that directory, but it has its own subdirectories -\photoshop album\, with some unique and some duplicated fonts, and \reqrd\ with a cmaps folder and a base folder with .pfb files and some corresponsing .pfms, along with a subfolder containing the remaining .pfms then there's the c:\psfonts folder with fonts that were installed directly with atm.</s><s> as you said, it's a mess, and just waiting for conflicts and incompatibilities! - herb
