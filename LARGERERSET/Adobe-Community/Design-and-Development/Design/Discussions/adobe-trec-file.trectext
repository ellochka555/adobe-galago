<s>roopavathy,

<s>keep in mind that computers and software are only "tools" used to create comps and production files.</s><s> the actual design comes from you.</s><s> sadly, you cannot tell your computer to "design me a logo" and it will comply.</s><s> when designing, i typically will start out with rough sketches and then polish a few of them to show the client for feedback.</s><s> once i received approval on one of the pencils, i will then create the artwork using illustrator.</s><s> the objective is to keep everything simple and unique.</s><s> for advanced corporate identity, 1, 2, or 3 spot colors will be selected for the logo.</s><s> once that has been approved, you can then move on to other things like stationery, signage, vehicle graphics, etc.</s><s> i have never used photoshop to design a logo.</s><s> as previosly mentioned, photoshop is too limiting.</s><s> if you need a .gif for your web site, use illustrator's "save-for-web" feature ( once your logo has been created and you've applied web safe color to it ).

<s>you are welcome, alfonso. 
</s><s>just a few bits here and now: 
with illustrator, you can create paths in two quite different ways. 
</s><s>one is by free/loose drawing, as with the paintbrush or the pencil tool, the other is by more controlled/precise creation of paths, as with the pen tool or the specific shape tools including the rectangle tool and those bundled with it. 
</s><s>it may be good to get to grips with both ways. 
</s><s>the former is much like real drawing, whereas the latter is quite different and requires your learning new ways; especially the pen tool is a challenge to use, but it may be very rewarding, and it may give you extremely smooth and elegant paths. 
</s><s>to really get to grips with the tools mentioned, you may go through the illustrator diocumentation and try things as you go. 
</s><s>in the process, you may ask for more specific advice in the illustrator forum where others may also contribute (another very friendly, and much busier, forum as you can see over there).

<s>hi jan, 
</s><s>logo the little computer icon in your logo is cute but something isn't quite right... 
</s><s>first off you are selling modern technology (ipads, headphones, computer accessories etc) however the logo font does not reflect this.</s><s> the font doesn't look modern (it creates an opposite effect). 
</s><s>personally i think you need to get rid of all the drop shadows (maybe - maybe - keep the dropshadow underneath your computer cartoon guy).</s><s> this will give your logo a cleaner appearance and will make your logo more readable and stand out more. 
</s><s>your computer cartoon icon is very finely detailed (e.g. teeth).</s><s> this won't transfer well onto clothing and you will lose the finer details in print.</s><s> even viewing your logo on the web, i can tell that the finer details are unnecessary.</s><s> simplicity is the way to go to create an effective logo! 
</s><s>also, i can't read the words "pre sale" too well either. 
</s><s>website your website seems fine and the well set out.</s><s> the appearance is clean and readable and that's the main thing.

<s>hello there, 
i'm a graphic designer who, like many others (i hope), loathes working with the microsoft office applications to complete or edit any designs.</s><s> getting a word doc from a client as their 'print-ready proof' will lead to my undoing someday. 
i would like to know if there is a way for me to create my designs using the adobe cs programs (photoshop, illustrator, and, namely, indesign), and also give my client the ability to make text edits once the design is complete without having to use the native adobe cs program it was built in for editing.</s><s> to be able to edit the document directly in acrobat reader, for example, or something similar.

<s>jonathan, 
</s><s>which application may be suitable for a given task depends on the amount and nature of the (non text) artwork, and on the number of pages to be made. 
</s><s>indesign is limited in artwork but strong in multiple pages. 
</s><s>illustrator (especially vector artwork) and photoshop (especially raster artwork) are strong in (their different kinds of) artwork but weak in multiple pages. 
</s><s>for some tasks it is convenient, or even necessary, to use at least two applications for the best result. 
a certain text editing can be done in adobe reader/acrobat (acrobat is the full version, reader now has adobe as the family name). 
</s><s>over time/versions, the text editing options in reader/acrobat and the multipage options in illustrator/photoshop have increased. 
</s><s>you should know that bringing text from worst into any of those applications means reprocessing it completely.</s><s> maybe especially in connexion with illustrator it is advisable/necessary to get rid of coding, so stripping it in a raw text editor may be the (only) way.

<s>there's no need to go to illustrator with the photo.</s><s> you can print from photoshop using the 1-bit halftone.</s><s> the thing that you have to keep in mind is not so much dpi ( which is an output resolution ), but the actual screen mesh used for the actual screen printing.</s><s> you also have to figure "screen angles" into the matrix because the screen angles are affected by not only the grament material, but the screen mesh, too.</s><s> so, i would recommend contacting the printer and finding out what screen frequency ( lpi / lines per inch ) will work best on the type of garment you are planning to print-on and ask the printer what mesh they plan to use for your job.</s><s> i've seen 35 lpi halftones; i've also seen 65 lpi halftones.</s><s> the finer the screen mesh, the higher the lpi.</s><s> tell the printer you have a 2-color job printing halftones and you need to know what lpi and what angles to use for color #1, and color #2.</s><s> then, you can input that information into the separation halftone files in photoshop.</s><s> remember to discuss the garment type ( thread count ) and the mesh of the screen.</s><s> if the printer is good and knows what they are doing, they will give you everything you need to know.</s><s> if they do not, they'll refuse the job.

<s>let me see if i can address each one of your concerns...   "my concerns are that i'm off the network, am the only one on an apple, have less functionality than people have with a pc (outlook meetings, lync, internal docs manager access, etc.</s><s>) and don't have a dedicated mac specialist in it."   as far as i know, you can connect to the network if you have the ip address:  go menu > network.   if i switched to a pc, would the apple indesign, illustrator and photoshop files open on the pc with minimal issues?   no, but you might get a migrate deal from adobe for a pc version of what you have now.   i do use a font manager now, so that may be the biggest problem with a transition.</s><s> open type is the only "universal font" that will move over without any issues correct?   yes.  open type fonts work on both pc and mac.  i prefer to still use legacy mac fonts that are open type.   any obvious benefits to working on a mac vs. pc?</s><s> time machine is the biggest one i can think of.   just productivity.  there are more operations to doing a basic command on a pc, whereas a mac can do 2 things at once and is a much more streamlined interface, more intuitive and faster.  this is my personal opnion having worked on both the mac and pc and still do.

<s>to add to john's comments.</s><s> outlook is available on a mac and mac mail is a good exchange client.</s><s> the mac calendar can subsribe and work with exhange calendar without issue.</s><s> lync works with macs as well.</s><s> i cannot comment on the internal document manager, siince i do not know what it is.</s><s> i work equally well with mac and pcs.</s><s> it is a personal choice.</s><s> for the most part, while macs are now more vulnerable to attacks than in the past, it still is not the target windows are.</s><s> you can run windows on a mac so you can use some of the windows software you do not have at the same time you run your other software on a mac. 
</s><s>as to cross-platform compatiblity, there are no issues except for font issues.</s><s> not all fonts found on one platform are available on the other, but for most standard open type fonts this is a non-issue.

<s>luisrm, have you checked out this site?</s><s> http://www.apple.com/support/macbasics/pctomac/ it might help with some of your keyboard shortcuts, etc. you can also remap some of your modifier keys if you want to make your keyboard more like the pc. 
</s><s>i've worked on macs for years, then had to go to a pc last august.</s><s> i have to say i'd prefer the macs.</s><s> my imac at home is supposedly less powerful than the dell i use at work, but the rendering time is so much faster.</s><s> i'm very frustrated with the amount of time it takes the dell to render a simple effect. 
</s><s>apart from that, once you are an adobe program, the interfaces are mostly identical from pc to mac.</s><s> there are a few small menu differences, mostly the location of preferences, but that's about it. 
</s><s>all in all, i much prefer the mac.
