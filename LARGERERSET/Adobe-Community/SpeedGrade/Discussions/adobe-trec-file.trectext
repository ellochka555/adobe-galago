<s>sorry to be the bearer of bad news ... there is a little hitch in the system that isn't obvious.</s><s> you know how the direct-link still uses a prpro project file as the "base", right?</s><s> and the reason you aren't allowed to do anything to the timeline (like add grading layers, change frame-rates & etc.</s><s>) within sg is because sg is not allowed to mess with the prpro base file, other than adding in its grading details? 
</s><s>well ... even though you may have 'auto-save' set in both prpro and sg ... during a direct-link session sg is not allowed to auto-save back over the prpro project file! 
</s><s>hadn't heard anything about this until i had a full-blown crash (one of only like two i've actually had) of sg back in mid-december.</s><s> after two hours of intense grading.</s><s> couldn't find the auto-save file of the appropriate time range, and yes, with prpro running in the background i'd had pop-up windows every 10 minutes or so saying it had saved.</s><s> i was a bit frantic and not too happy, had a deadline next day.</s><s> a staffer came on here to tell me that although it wasn't stated too obviously anywhere, sg isn't allowed to auto-save. 
</s><s>that got a few comments back from some folks with rather a lot more "suites" in grading work daily than my little shop ... horrified to learn auto-save wasn't applicable to their new cool hot workflow. 
</s><s>so ...</s><s> please from now on do a manual save-as and give yourself an iteration letter/number every so many minutes.</s><s> sorry you didn't know about this.</s><s> total bummer.

<s>matyas, 
</s><s>doesn't matter if you've got one or both programs open ...</s><s> a direct-link prpro to speedgrade session will not save a prpro project back onto "itself", it's not "allowed" to interfere in the timeline of a prpro project until you tell it to close & go back to prpro.</s><s> that is why the above-mentioned work-around is necessary ...</s><s> if in a dl process.</s><s> in that dl process, you simply have to do a manual save-as within spedgrade ... period. 
</s><s>now ... if you export an edl or such-like out, then import that into sg in "native" mode operation, it still doesn't make any difference if you've got both programs open or closed ...</s><s> sg will auto-save as you expect.</s><s> as will prpro. 
</s><s>so this is a situation that only applies to the direct link process, and always applies no matter if you have both programs open at once or not.</s><s> it isn't about the programs "competing", it's about what speedgrade is not allowed to do to a prpro project file in that direct link process. 
</s><s>it's been sent by numerous people to the adobe team as a bug request, feature request, and through the staffers that occasionally pop in here.</s><s> so ... it is possible this gets fixed in the sometime-not-too-far-off-we-certainly-hope future.</s><s> we hope ...

<s>hi jim 
</s><s>thanks for this, kinda.</s><s> appreciate your offering a workaround but when you have an edit that you want to colour correct mid process (just to match cameras up before applying adjustment layer for entire grade) rather than being at the end of the process then this is just won't work. 
i think the direct link feature is awesome and works so well for moving back and forth between the two applications.</s><s> way better than say exporting edls or xmls and going to davinci resolve.</s><s> love that you can continue editing or tweaking the project after coming back which is harder to do coming back from the other applications.</s><s> that said, and as you say, it seems like it needs another round of updates to make it a truly useable application using this approach.

<s>interesting ... process ... you have there.</s><s> hmmm.</s><s> i can't think of any way you could work in sg that isn't on a timeline.</s><s> whether made in prpro or there in sg(native) ... it's a video editing program, and that's done on a timeline.</s><s> plus the way the both prpro and sg are designed, you must define and name a project before you can start to work. 
</s><s>now, other than where the working files for the project will be kept, you don't really have to complete the forms out in prpro especially.</s><s> after you give your project a name and say where it's files will be kept, you can simply skip the rest and when you create a new sequence & drop a clip onto it, the sequence settings will be set to match your footage. 
</s><s>now ... do you have all one type footage (codec, frame size & rate) or different kinds, say some 1080p-24fps, some 720i-60fps, some 460p-29.976fps, that sort of thing? 
</s><s>you know, what i'm thinking ... might actually be the easiest.</s><s> create a project in prpro ... and a new sequence for each type of footage.</s><s> use the media browser panel to import all your footage into the project panel ... drag & drop a few similar clips to a sequence, then dl that over to sg (takes a couple seconds) to grade/look 'em.</s><s> save 'em back to prpro, then render that sequence out.</s><s> then when you know you've got a good render, either delete the clips from that timeline & re-use it, or create a new one.</s><s> do your next group.</s><s> rinse and repeat, so to speak. 
i take it you've no reason to save the sequences of graded clips past rendering them, so you should be able to use just the one "projects" and import folders as necessary, removing them as you will.</s><s> you won't spend near any time with the "project" details, but the programs will be happy. 
</s><s>again, as noted above you can either copy a grade to other clips on a sequence or put an "adjustment layer" over the clips of a sequence in prpro (project panel: new item -> adjustment layer) and then grade that ... it will automatically be applied to all clips under it. 
</s><s>and before you ask again, there isn't any way to work a single clip without it being a "project" with a timeline.</s><s> these aren't photoshop, where you can open a single image.

<s>red giant's cosmo is just sick.</s><s> it identifies the skin tone automatically, and sticks the"keyer" to skin like glue, then gives you a ton of slider options to tweak as much (or as little) as you want to apply.... if you want to crank it up you can easily take 20 years off your actors.</s><s> what 40 year old doesn't want to look 20!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s> then again if you want a very subtle smooth look, that is easy to get too.</s><s> red giant is really doing well in this area.</s><s> i can't believe speedgrade is leaving us hanging (with just the gaussian blur option)... it works ok, but doesn't leave any of the important features very clear (i.e. eyes, lips, teeth) it kind of blurs everything.</s><s> cosmo does not, it retains amazing detail in the eyes, etc...</s><s> i'll say it again, adobe needs to open up speed grade to 3rd party plugins like red giant.</s><s> i don't understand why they don't, it is available in pp and ae...</s><s> go figure... maybe it is just a matter of time.

<s>again ... rather than nifty new features, i'd like some pressure on adobe to fix major things that need a "touch" to get them working in a basically useful manner. 
</s><s>such as ...</s><s> speedgrade's scopes.</s><s> look at the enclosed pic, a screen grab of my "4 scopes/10bit" layout i currently see. 
</s><s>does any of this look like it should be this way? 

</s><s>let's start with the histogram, upper left.</s><s> currently showing negative values on two colors.</s><s> if i adjust the "base" in any way, those move somewhere ... but they do not stay where they are when i release them after i release the control ... and note, i'm using a track wheel.</s><s> i rotate the wheel or outer ring to where i like, then hit a button to 'release'.</s><s> the placement of the scale always moves on release, can be either up or down, so i have to just move it about until they end up sorta where i want them after the 'bounce'.</s><s> time consuming and less than optimal workflow? 
</s><s>next ... lower left quadrant, the vectorscope.</s><s> note there are no "graticules" visible on this one, as there are at least on the other four.</s><s> which means ...</s><s> no target boxes for those using the nice spendy calibration cards to use to calibrate their footage, you have to guess where the various colors are on the scale, and of course ...</s><s> no "skin-tone" line available either.</s><s> stuuupid.</s><s> 
</s><s>next ... whole right side.</s><s> note how weird the parade and waveform scales are set up?</s><s> they compress the scales rather than showing the work you've done on a full-height area like every other scope ever made.</s><s> but they don't even do it the same on both scales.</s><s> note that on the top one, the black area has shortened to match the number-scale figures, to about half the height it should be.</s><s> and the other one ... the black box is still full height, but the numbers have shrunk to half-box height. 
</s><s>what the hell?</s><s> not one of these scopes is displayed in any sensible or easily usable way.

</s><s>and at least a fair number of us (though there are a lot fewer here than on the p-pro forum board) have actually gone and done just that.</s><s> multiple times.</s><s> i wonder if they've got a filter to auto-dump mine anymore ... sigh. 
</s><s>as shooternz points out, even when one has commented on a thread, and then is just asked (politely) what the reasoning is behind this gui approach, how are we supposed to benefit from it ... there's no reply.</s><s> no further staff comment in that thread. 
i actually have talked an sg issue over chat and during the discussion, asked about the scopes ... not that staffer's area of knowledge was the brief response, and back to the original chat topic.</s><s> could i get a response over that from someone else?</s><s> ...</s><s> no, we need to keep on the current chat topic. 
</s><s>so ... yea, getting to talk with someone at adobe about this is not easy.</s><s> it would make a huge difference in use of the program for me, and i do know a couple guys who are major colorists, and ... they told me that the first thing they do in a grading suite is look at the scopes.</s><s> their most important need is good scopes, not snazzy but rarely used "features".</s><s> all they had to do was look at the scopes in sg and it proved itself an amateur tool.</s><s> they won't even look at it no matter how easy the transfer of projects p-pro/sg/ae is until the scopes are actual tools for a professional colorist. 
</s><s>so, again, shooternz has a point ... too many of the 'real pros' won't use sg because of the scopes as a first among other issues ... so there's not that many to complain about them.</s><s> amateurs (like i should still be considered at this point though i do this for paying clients ...</s><s> i'm that much a "noob") don't tend to grade by the scopes ... pros grade (often) as much or more by scopes as by their eyes. 
</s><s>after reading "color correction for video" (hullfish/fowler) ... and some of the lynda-dot-com vids and others ...</s><s> i've become a scopes grader.</s><s> i need to see what's happening to my footage in those scopes, and ... if that is ok, then ... see what my eyeballs think of it.</s><s> better and actually faster work.</s><s> but these scopes suck.</s><s>

<s>hi patrick

</s><s>the above dropped my time considerably ... both in what i suddenly didn't need to learn and in how fast i could go back and forth.</s><s> and sg-cc has become quite a bit nicer to use.

</s><s>i think you missed the bit where i talked of how fast the cc workflow is, prpro link to sg go back to prpro.</s><s> there isn't any export involved as there was in cs6, so all that time you mention, all those files?</s><s> old history, it doesn't work at all like that anymore in cc.</s><s> which is one of the reasons i'm loving my cc. 
</s><s>working on a sequence in prpro, decide to do some grading ... click on "send to sg" link ... immediately goes to a dialog box asking me if i want to save first ...</s><s> "yes" ... then to a dialog box in sg asking which sequence of the current prpro project i want to open, with the one i had open highlighted.</s><s> click on it, sg opens right up on that timeline sequence.</s><s> immediately.</s><s> no waiting.</s><s> no files created. 
</s><s>work your sequence ... decide to go back to prpro, click the icon for "back to prpro" and it saves the project and reopens prpro.</s><s> immediately.</s><s> 
</s><s>there are a few caveats to this workflow.</s><s> running directly off the prpro project file, sg is not allowed to play with the timeline.</s><s> you can't add or subtract footage or even layers on the timeline itself.</s><s> if you'll be wanting to add a grading layer, you need to lay on "adjustment" layers in prpro before going to sg.</s><s> i still forget to do that at times, or want one where i didn't think i'd want one, and it takes less than 30 seconds to round-trip back to prpro, add adjustment layers over individual clips or multiples or the whole sequence. 
</s><s>some of the "native" sg features and panels are locked-out because of this ... anything that would modify footage details such as frame-rates and all must be done in prpro ... but that's where you'd have just come from and be going to so that's just an issue of where you do it. 
</s><s>the other thing i found is that even though there are auto-saves set both in prpro and sg, because sg is not allowed to modify a prpro project file it is not allowed to save a project file either.</s><s> was a painfully learned lesson, but ah well, a little pain and one does learn one's lessons well, right? 
</s><s>so ... while grading within a prpro project, one needs to manually save or preferably do iterative "save-as" steps every few minutes. 
</s><s>but holy cricky ... not ever exporting an edl or anything like that ... not having to worry about transcoding footage (as sg can handle anything that prpro can within a dl-process) ... not having tons of extra intermediary files ... and the sheer operating speed of going back and forth ...</s><s> a joy.</s><s>

<s>drystonewall, 
</s><s>i am sincerely sorry but i do not see exactly what you clearly felt about shooternz's post.</s><s> i look back through his comments and would have to agree with the points about cs5.5->cs6, that was (to my view also) a definite version-step up.</s><s> did everyone using cs5.5 need or directly benefit from the changes involved?</s><s> of course not.</s><s> yet it still was over-all a version upgrade.</s><s> in our studio, with three to five computers running photoshop (a couple of them laptops running under their "comapanion" desktop) we chose whether or not any particular work-area needed any particular upgrade.</s><s> our sales room was nearly always "two steps back" ... mine was normally a version back, and the wife's was frequently spanking new.</s><s> those operating in the video/film sphere obviously made the same decisions. 
</s><s>adobe changed their operating model at the end of the cs6 software cycle.</s><s> the switch was to provide software as a service rather than a product.</s><s> conceptually rather than having coders work on making a large enough change at one whop to justify a lot of people shelling out big bucks for the "new do", it was a change to simply having coders constantly working on upgrading the software and sending out multiple upgrades as they are ready to go, rather than holding them and making a new bundle. 
</s><s>hasn't been a perfect roll-out, as everyone has noticed.</s><s> and there've been some major foul-ups in there.</s><s> most of which they've attacked and fixed ... yet a few big ones remain such that some entire "houses" have felt a need to work elsewhere for the time being.</s><s> that's definitely not a perfect roll-out.</s><s> clearly for some people with their particular mix of os, footage formats & codecs, other involved software used on steps of their pipeline capture->delivery and a particular format/codec they need to deliver, the adobe stuff isn't a usable option.</s><s> at this time. 
</s><s>the only one they've said they're not working at bringing into the "works" is footage with a variable bitrate such as from some smart-phones and computer-monitoring software.</s><s> and everything else they're working on as they can solve one problem and move onto the next.</s><s> considering the range of options they're trying to build software for, it is a formidable task.</s><s> everyone from the relatively simply demands i (also a one-man shop as far as video goes) that i place on things to major tv delivery houses and clearly they want to become more usable in the "film" work also. 
</s><s>and their path forward for software is as clearly stated for over a year, the "cc" model as they call it.</s><s> as a ... convenience?</s><s> ... they are still selling cs6.</s><s> for now.</s><s> they are putting no develpment into it, and again, have been very clear about that. 
</s><s>if cs5.5 floats your boat just fine, that's great ... enjoy it.</s><s> no reason you shouldn't and especially if it does everything you need hey, the cost is great, right? 
</s><s>their first iteration of speedgrade was ... interesting.</s><s> a very different gui still than any of the cs products as they'd just acquired it and hadn't had a chance to modify the gui into something that someone used to adobe software would even recognize.</s><s> even the "full" cs6 iteration of speedgrade ... which was the first one i purchased ... was still complicated for me and extremely difficult to work with.</s><s> sending anything to it from prpro was a royal pain, and getting it back into prpro even looking like it did in sg was almost impossible for me.</s><s> so i did most of my 'grading' (such as it was) in prpro, a little actually in aftereffects using shian storm's "colorghears" lut's. 
</s><s>when the cc7 stuff arrived, i tried it out ... and the first couple weeks were crazy.</s><s> it behaved differently than the ol' "6" version, and their explanation of the differences in working within a dl timeline didn't really explain how differently this was designed to work.</s><s> after getting another <dot>-x down the road and learning how it's supposed to work, and not trying to make it work the old way ... wow, it's been a game-changer for me.</s><s> i don't have to know squat about transferring projects, transcoding, edl's, rendering out and importing back ...</s><s> none of that. 
</s><s>it's not part of my workflow.</s><s> i just dl a timeline over to sg, and immediately work on that timeline.</s><s> send it back to prpro and immediately i'm back in prpro working away.</s><s> between the time saved going to and from, the total lack of a need to move files from one to the other or normally even re-link anything, and the vastly easier project management from not having all those extra files to worry about, and know which ones to dump and which to keep, that's several hours a week. 
</s><s>would good professional quality scopes help?</s><s> oh baby yea.</s><s> 
</s><s>will they finally get them?</s><s> i expect so ... they've added a bunch of other things and fixed a lot of other things, i think they'll get to it eventually.</s><s> but even if they don't the ease and speed of my workflow saves me a ton of time and hassle. 
</s><s>time is money ... and i save a bunch of money using this software.</s><s> and i've probably wasted a ton of your time if you've actually read the whole thing i've written.</s><s> if you do take the trial i would heartily suggest getting a look by asking for some of the users around here as to how to utilize this in your workflow.</s><s> give a typical project or perhaps an overview of a couple typical projects, and ask how folks would work them.</s><s> shooternz and jim simon and several of the others will probably chime in with ideas ... especially after one of them does and of course, could use some ... well, not correction precisely, but ... guidance?</s><s> ... in their choices. 
i don't suggest this because in any way shape or form i think you don't know your work ... in fact, i'm assuming you are a lot more knowledgeable in many areas of video work than i. the reason i suggest this is the adobe suite has become something very different than we had before.</s><s> it takes a different workflow pattern ... and it's not always obvious what that is.</s><s> i don't know how many people have come on here frustrated because they can't figure out how to do "x" and are frustrated that there's quite a work-around needed to do that anymore. 
</s><s>now, about the third post on the thread someone will ask them why they want to ... as simply that step isn't needed anymore.</s><s> sometimes people actually can step back and go ... oh ... and try the "new" way, and go away happy.</s><s> sometimes there isn't a way to do what they want without a stupid workaround.</s><s> yea, those are damn frustrating. 
</s><s>and sadly sometimes people are simply so used the "fact" that all such workflows require you to do "x" and they don't want to hear any stupid comments about the way it must be done.</s><s> such as ...</s><s> i'm so amazed at the number of people who transcode for their nle, then insist on transcoding to get the best codec for grading ... then transcode again for output.</s><s> are there a couple formats of either file/camera-capture that say, prpro can't work with well or at all?</s><s> yep.</s><s> but much of the transcoding people right about involves files prpro handles just fine these days ... and can dl over to sg without need of anything.</s><s> so ... why mangle your footage, take the time both out of prpro and into sg, and take up far more disc space? 
i dunno ... but some people insist. 
</s><s>there are for so many things a different way of doing them now.</s><s> and especially for this one-man shop, the adobe stuff saves me far more time than the cc model costs me compared to any other way i could be regularly working and upgrading my software. 
</s><s>but as i'm very aware ... everybody's mileage varies. 
</s><s>neil
