</s><s>in premiere elements 10, if you have not already, try right clicking the audio, selecting audio gain, and then normalize in the clip gain dialog.

i am not too hopeful about the audio gain in premiere elements, but the audacity increased amplification may be the answer. http://thebest3d.com/audacity/tutorials/make-louder/audacity-tutorial- make-louder-more-volume-increased-amplitude.html

</s><s>welcome to the forum. 
</s><s>for clarification, exactly which adobe program(s) do you have? 
</s><s>there is adobe photoshop elements (an image editing program), adobe premiere elements (a video editing program) and seems that you do have this, hence the dvd menu question, adobe photoshop (photoshop elements "big-brother"), and the one that steve references. 
i agree completely with steve - pre provides ways to do a lot of customization of the menu set templates, and it's fairly easy to do.

</s><s>if you create your own disc menu template from scratch, then you need photoshop cs or higher to create the main menu and scene menu psd files. 
</s><s>if you modify an existing adobe disc menu template, you will probably need photoshop cs or higher unless you can find a version of photoshop elements that will open the layer sets in the layers palette of the .psd for the menus. 
</s><s>the replacement of background in the movie menu section does not often allow for a full replacement of the existing background.</s><s> but, that can be done at the editing of the .psd level by replacing the background layer in the layers palette of the menu's .psd file.</s><s> in the best case scenario, replacing the background layer of the .psd's layers palette does not require opening layer sets, so photoshop elements can be used for the edit of the .psd involved.

<s>simon, 
</s><s>the task of creating disc menus from scratch or modifying the existing menus at the .psd level of the adobe disc menu theme is not all that difficult and/or crazy.</s><s> it is quite easy when you get into it.</s><s> and, there are ways to make things easier for yourself. 
</s><s>an example has been given regarding the possible task of customizing the scene menu for the kidsbday_hd_sm.psd, pointing to 154 layers in the layers layers palette.</s><s> the text layers for each of the 5 scene layer sets are for 14 different languages, only one is activated.</s><s> the other 13 sit there unused with their visibility icon set accordingly.</s><s> unless, you are making a multi-language disc menu template for distribution and use as such, you can delete 13 of the text layers for each of the 5 scene buttons in the scene menu ,psd.</s><s> i did not do a count on the total number of layers stated, but given 154, 154 - 65 layers. = down to 89. 
a lot will depend on the design of the original template with regard to how much you can help yourself in customizing the .psd.</s><s> this particular disc menu has exceptionally more layers in the background and foreground layer sets as others where you would expect to find one background layer and no foreground layer. 
</s><s>as for the use of gimp 2.8 mobile as a substitute for photoshop....the gimp layers area can be expanded so that the scroll bar and most of everything else need not look so compressed.</s><s> however, the selection of the video editor can make the task easier or harder to see and control.</s><s> depending on what you want to do photoshop elements may very well be part of the task getting done successfully equation. 
no matter what tools, attention to detail is very important down to the typing a name for a text file.

<s>@atromano - first, thank you for your reply.</s><s> i've been trying to correct this problem since purchasing the new computer in dec, and this is effecting my livelihood.</s><s> here's a what i know. 
</s><s>downloaded adobe premiere 11 from amazon in june 2013 onto my sony vaio laptop running on windows 7. the avi files from my fujifilm finepix 4500s camera were accepted.</s><s> the avi files are titled dscf0217.avi. for example.

</s><s>went to best buy.</s><s> they spent two hours on it, nothing.</s><s> there solution since the avi files worked on windows media player, was to start uses sony vaio's editing software the comes with the computer, really? 
</s><s>then all of a sudden, the program is gone.</s><s> completely removed from my computer.</s><s> all the projects and video/pics in elements included. 
</s><s>so last night i redownloaded the software from amazon.</s><s> thank goodness they kept the serial number. 
</s><s>surprisingly, the projects are still there, though when i open them most of the files in the timeline are avi and appear as "media offline."

<s>syracusek8 
sorry i could not get to you sooner.</s><s> the adobe system has been done for "maintenance". 
i have your answer.</s><s> you camera is recording motionjpeg.avi files which can be highly problematic for premiere elements.</s><s> it is a debate often between the codec not being present versus the codec not being available to premiere elements. 
</s><s>at any rate the resolution can be found a. check the camera for a utility that came with it...when installed that will most likely supply the codec needed for the use of that source media

</s><s>thanks for the reply. 
</s><s>if you have an orange line over the timeline (in the location that i pointed to in the screenshot) and the gray tabs of the work area bar are set to span the content under that orange line, then the program is indicating that you need to render the that timeline content to get the best possible preview of what plays back from the timeline in the monitor.

</s><s>render button above the timeline or press the enter key of the computer main keyboard or go to timeline menu/render work area bar 
what is happening...are you just getting play back, no turning of the orange line to green? 
</s><s>if you have no colored line or a green line, your rendering will not take place.</s><s> rendering gives you the best possible preview, but those two rendering indicators are telling you that you have the best possible preview already.</s><s> it is only the orange lined content that can be rendered.</s><s> that orange line is the program telling you that you do not have the best possible preview and to get it you need to render that timeline content.

<s>green_turtles, 
</s><s>an orange, or yellowish-orange line above the clips indicate that for the smoothest possible playback, one needs to render that part of the timeline. 
</s><s>now, there are considerations: 
the playback might be more than adequate, without rendering.</s><s> i have many projects, with that line, that i never bother to render, as things are good enough, without it.</s><s> however, and especially if i am doing keyframing of effects, i might render that area many times, to see exactly what i have done, and if it works perfectly.

</s><s>still images can display the yellow line, as they need to be "translated" into synthetic video - they are stills, but will become video, at output.

<s>atr, i'm very glad you jumped back in.</s><s> so, thank you. 
</s><s>i've done everything you have suggested, and i'm getting the same issue.</s><s> however, there is one observation that could help you further narrow it down. 
</s><s>i'm going to respond to all your suggestions, point-by-point below in order to help you - help me- the best i can 


1.</s><s> i am assuming that you are working in the expert workspace of premiere elements 12. if so, the go to the quick workspace and try each of the following [ correct] a. hit the render button above the filmstrip there [done] b. go to timeline menu/click on render work area [done] c. press enter key of the computer main keyboard [done] 

</s><s>did the rendering dialog come up at any time?</s><s> [yes, (and this has been happening all along), when i try to render, in any of the 3 ways above, i do see a window pop up for a millisecond and then it disappears.</s><s> i hightly suspect that it is the "render" window that is attempting to open, but just goes away for some reason. 
</s><s>when you went back to the expert workspace, was there now a green line instead of an orange line over the timeline content spanned by the gray tabs of the work area bar?</s><s> [no, still orange coolor] 
2. make a copy of the problem project (file menu/save a copy and renaming it).</s><s> open the copy and determine if you can render the expert workspace timeline content of that of the quick workspace filmstrip. 
3.</s><s> have you cleared out the preview files in the adobe premiere elements previews file folder for this problem project?</s><s> [yes, manually went inside the adobe premiere e previews file and deleted everything] double check on that.</s><s> how much free space is there at the location where you have this adobe premiere elements previews files folder?</s><s> [plenty of space is left ~ 230gb] next, go to edit menu/preferences/media and its media cache datebase and hit the clean button there to get rid of conformed video files.</s><s> [hit the clean button, twice] 
4. next, delete the premiere elements 12's settings file named adobe premiere elements prefs.</s><s> the route to it in windows 7, 8, or 8.1 64 bit is local disk c users owner appdata roaming adobe premiere elements 12.0 and in the 12.0 folder is the adobe premiere elements prefs file that you delete.</s><s> if that does not work, delete the whole 12.0 folder in which the adobe premiere elements prefs file exists.</s><s> be sure to be working with folder option show hidden files, folders, and drives active so that you can see the path cited.</s><s> [wend all the way inside the 12.0 folder, but did not see any file called adobe premiere elements prefs, so deleted the whole 12.0 folder instead as you suggested] 
</s><s>just starting my day.</s><s> we will be watching for further developments.</s><s> i will be thinking about this some more.

</s><s>add on...leaving the whys behind can lead to more of the same.</s><s> so, unless you are in a time crunch to get this project out, let us not give up just yet [ i am not in any rush to get this out, and i not giving up if you aren't .</s><s> i can tell you like to solve puzzles and i thank you for it.</s><s>]

<s>love_green_turtles 
</s><s>challenging.</s><s> but, have not given up. 
</s><s>you have already established that going to a new project allows you to render or not render according to the classical rendering indicators. and deleting the source media of the problem project track by track does not solve the problem.

<s>welcome to the forum. 
</s><s>first, let's start with details on what exactly is on those dvd disks. 
a dvd can be either a dvd-video, which will play on a computer with dvd software, or on a dvd player, hooked to a tv. or, it can be a dvd-data disc, which contains av (audio video) files, that can be played on a computer with av players, like windows media player.</s><s> do you know exactly what you have? 
</s><s>if those are dvd-videos, they will contain a video_ts folder, containing ifo, bup and vob files.</s><s> it will be the vob files, that you will want to import into pre, to be edited. 
</s><s>there are some considerations, and one is that each dvd-video will contain a single video_ts folder.</s><s> they will all have the same folder name, "video_ts," though the vob files inside will be different for each of your 20 discs. 
</s><s>if that is the case, then one workflow would be to create 20 folders on an internal hdd (hard disk drive), named "dvd_01," through dvd_20." then, copy each dvd to the respective folder.</s><s> from there, you can create a new project, that would be either ntsc, or pal dv (depending on where you live).</s><s> then, import the vob's from those 20 folders into that project, where you could begin editing. 
</s><s>when edited, one could then author a new dvd-video with menus, for the final memorial disc. 
</s><s>if you can let us know more about those dvd's, then someone can direct you as to the workflows that would be best.

<s>prizewinner, 
</s><s>to create dvd-videos edited from your dvd-videos, you will need a video-editing program, such as premiere elements.</s><s> the current version is pre 12.</s><s> i would recommend that you download and install the trial version of pre 12, and test it.</s><s> pre 12 does offer a "guided" mode, where the program steps the user through the process. 
</s><s>the two limitations of the trial version of pre is that it will expire after 30 days (should be time to test), and it will add a watermark to the timeline, and to any output.</s><s> however, if one buys the full-paid version, and activates it, the watermark will not appear in any new project.</s><s> there is a process for removing that watermark from the project, but that will not have any effect on a project's output file - that will have the watermark. 
</s><s>because of the watermark, and the 30-day time limit on the trial version, i would not get too deeply into your project initially.</s><s> just create those sub-folders i mentioned above, with "dvd_01," "dvd_02," etc., and copy the contents of a couple of your dvd-videos (make sure that you know which existing dvd-video is which) to the respective sub-folders. 
</s><s>next, go to new project, and import the vob's from dvd_01 into it.</s><s> pre should create the appropriate project settings from the first vob, when you drag it to the timeline.</s><s> repeat with the vob's from dvd_02. 
</s><s>drag the dvd_01 vob's to the timeline, and practice editing, using the expert guided mode.</s><s> look for the little pop-up tooltips windows to guide you. 
</s><s>if everything is working, i would not output anything yet.</s><s> i would not render the timeline yet.</s><s> just buy pre, and activate it with the s/n that is supplied.</s><s> that will remove the watermark from your timeline. 
</s><s>some of the terms that i have used will likely be alien to you, since you have not been working in pre yet.</s><s> please do not hesitate to ask for clarification on anything.</s><s> besides the expert guided mode, you have this forum, and a lot of folk eager to help you. 
</s><s>good luck, and let us know if you have any questions.

<s>prizewinner 
</s><s>the following is my view of the situation. 
</s><s>we are after the video files in the video_ts folder.</s><s> typically they will be a series of vob files which will begin with the file name of vts_01_1.vob.</s><s> tip: there could be one or several depending on the duration of the disc content.</s><s> the vts.....vob that you want is confirmed by its larger file size.</s><s> the max size for any one of these vobs is 0.99 gb. 
</s><s>on the dvd disc, these specific vob files exist in the dvd-video format and need to be ripped from the dvd disc for use in your video project.</s><s> photoshop elements 8 is not going to do that.</s><s> you can do this ripping two ways a. with a video editor that has this vob ripping feature or b. using your computer's command prompt feature to create one file which represents seamless merging of all the vob files into one.</s><s> please refer to my blog post for this concept. http://www.atr935.blogspot.com/2013/09/pe-dvd-videoseamless-vob-rippin g.html 
in view of the situation, i am not suggesting the "b" the command prompt way. 
i am suggesting that you download and install the free 30 days tryout of premiere elements 12 as your video editor and look at the following workflow.... 
a. open premiere elements 12 to the expert workspace.</s><s> go to file menu/new/project and manually set the project preset for ntsc dv standard (for now i am assuming that is what you have on the dvd discs is ntsc dvd-video standard 4:3 - let me know if ntsc dvd-video widescreen 16:9) 
b. insert your first dvd disc in the dvd burner tray. 
c. in premiere elements 12, go to add media/"dvd camera or computer drive"/video importer, 
d. in the video importer, place check mark next to the vts_01_1.vob thumbnail, set the save in: for a folder in videos of libraries/videos, and also have a check mark next to add to timeline.</s><s> this way you will be saving these files to a computer hard drive location (in this case libraries/videos) as well as opening them in a project.</s><s> then press get media in the video importer.</s><s> at that point, you will see your vob in the expert workspace as a thumbnail in project assets as well as on the timeline (video track 1/audio track 1).</s><s> and, you can begin your edit of the vob. 
</s><s>alternatively....</s><s> 
</s><s>at the video importer stage, you can just save the vobs to libraries/videos and not open into a new project with them at that time.</s><s> then, at a later date, you can import the saved vobs from the libraries/videos into a new premiere elements project with premiere elements' add media/files and folders/project assets.</s><s> you can double click the vob thumbnail in project assets to bring up the preview windows with its set in and set out points to split the vob into segments.</s><s> further organizational and use aspects of this idea are found in my blog post http://www.atr935.blogspot.com/2013/06/pe11-project-assets-organizatio n-for.html 
the above should get you through the 1st of your dvds, but there is a tip to avoid getting stuck with an "already imported message" from the video importer when you have not imported the vobs of the additional dvds. 
</s><s>all the dvds will give you the same name for the video file, vts_01_1.vob etc consequently, for each new dvd, the video importer save in must be directed to a new folder with a different name in the libraries/videos. 
</s><s>lots of details.</s><s> not so bad once you see all these details in action. 
</s><s>have you decided if your destination is going to be dvd-video standard on dvd disc or a file saved to hard drive and then projected onto a screen from a computer player or other?</s><s> if this is going on a disc, we will get in the burn dialog's reading for space required and bitrate with a check mark next to space required and bitrate.</s><s> but, for now, just in case note...</s><s> dvd 4.7 gb/120 minutes, in reality is 4.38 gb.</s><s> dvd 8.5 gb/240 minutes, in reality is 7.95 gb. 
</s><s>details beget details it seems. 
</s><s>looking forward to learning of your progress.

just in case notes that may sometimes get overlooked..... 
1. after purchase of the premiere elements, you can remove the adobe watermark from a project file (project.prel) that you created during the tryout.</s><s> but, you cannot remove the adobe watermark that exists in one of the exports from the tryout project.prel file (even after you get a purchased serial number and are working from the purchased program).</s><s> a. the classical answer to getting rid of the adobe watermark from your tryout project.prel files after you purchase the product is to delete the rendered files of the trial project.prel which is opened in the purchased program.</s><s> b. however, i and others have found the often just opening the trial project.prel into the purchased program removes the adobe watermark automatically with no need to delete any rendered files.

your nikon d3 appears to be recording using motionjpeg video compression which may or may not work with premiere elements (any version). 
</s><s>the first thing to do (in suggested order) is to 
a. determine if your premiere elements in your computer environment supports the motionjpeg and, if not, then b. look for a utility bundled in with your nikond3 - if found, install to provide the necessary codec and if "b" is not possible c. download and install the morgan motionjpeg codec http://www.afterdawn.com/software/audio_video/codecs/morgan_m-jpeg_cod ec.cfm it is not free.</s><s> if it works for you, it is quicker than the file conversions.</s><s> if that works for you, then you can decide if it is worth the investment.</s><s> i have no promotional interests in the product. and if none of that worked d. conversion methods for what looks like 1280 x 720 @ 29.97 progressive frames per second (motionjpeg avi)....perhaps taking it to h.264.mp4 1280 x 720 @ 29.97 progressive frames per second.</s><s> we can discuss converters later if needed.

</s><s>premiere elements 11 and 12 are set up so that the program automatically sets the project preset for you based on the properties of the first video drag to the timeline.</s><s> sometimes it does it ok, sometimes not.</s><s> in those not situations, then you set the project preset manually yourself based the the video properties that you know.</s><s> when the program does the set and does it wrong, it does not give you the closest set but rather its default which is ntsc avchd full hd1080i30, which just happens to be the project preset we are targeting for anyway if your audio is stereo and not 5.1 channel. 
</s><s>if you are going to start off by letting the program do this task for you, then you can check what it has set by looking at edit menu/project settings/general and the editing mode, timebase, frame rate, and pixel aspect ratio.</s><s> for the project preset of ntsc avchd full hd1080i30, you should see project settings 

</s><s>bottom line: i would expect you to do ok letting the program set the project preset.</s><s> there should be no way for it to mess up. 
</s><s>however, if your video has 5.1 channel audio, then definitely set the project preset yourself manually for ntsc avchd full hd1080i30 5.1 channel unless you see the 5.1 in the audio track if you let the program set the project preset. 

</s><s>in this case, you cannot depend on checking the program's set with project settings because both ntsc avchd full 1080i30 and ntsc avchd full 1080i30 5.1 channel will present the same the project settings dialog figures, no mention of 5.1 there. 
</s><s>to set the project preset manually file menu/new/project change settings and then, before you exit the new project dialog in that area, be sure to have a check mark next to force selected project setting on this project. 
</s><s>then back in the premiere elements workspace, add media/ 
with regard to export choices... 
</s><s>publish+share computer avchd with presets = m2t - h.264 1920 x 1080i30 would be a good choice to start with for a file saved to the computer hard drive. 
</s><s>also, take a look at mp4 - h.264 1920 x 1080p30 and see how that holds up when you shoot 1080i30 (aka 60i).

</s><s>after you check out the details in my replies numbered 4 and 5, please let us know what supplemental information that you would like to have regarding your project's importing, editing, and exporting. 
i thought that i can covered the manual selection of the project preset back in post 4 which might be indicated by factors as described in the following http://www.atr935.blogspot.com/2013/04/pe11-accuracy-of-automatic-proj ect.html 
in the case of my description back in post 4, the specific relevant dialogs that you would meet on your path to setting the project preset manually would be: 
file menu/new/project 

</s><s>new project dialog - click on change settings button 

</s><s>select project preset ntsc avchd avchd 1080p60 

</s><s>click ok to the change settings dialog when finished making the 1080p60 selection and then you will see the new project dialog again where you put a check mark next to "force selected project setting on this project" and then click ok.

<s>in pre, the easiest way to burn multiple dvd's, is to first burn to folder, creating the video_ts folder, with the necessary ifo, bup and vob files.</s><s> then, use a burning utility, such as the free imgburn, to do the physical burns.</s><s> it also gives you the ability to use a slower burn speed.

<subject>Premiere Elements 8 Initial Impressions</subject>
<post author="A.T. Romano" timestamp="Sep 24, 2009 9:31 AM">
<s>premiere elements 8 first look: part 1.</s><s> 
</s><s>photoshop elements 8 and premiere elements 8 are now installed on my windows xp sp3 with about available 1 gb ram and 70 gb free hard drive space and the virtual memory controlled by the operating system-not great for a heavy duty project, but adequate to overview the programs. 
1.</s><s> download & installation.</s><s> both programs took about 3 ? hours to download, using high speed dsl.</s><s> premiere elements 8 downloaded and installed without problems.</s><s> installation went much quicker.</s><s> but, photoshop elements 8 download did present challenges, first, it kept downloading premiere elements 8 instead of photoshop elements 8.</s><s> finally in the early hours of the morning, the download from the adobe site was named photoshop elements 8.</s><s> great, except, once downloaded it would not launch.</s><s> the launcher did not know what to do with the .</s><s>7z file.</s><s> download and use of winzip took care of that.</s><s> my default browser mozilla firefox was worthless for the download of either photoshop elements 8 or premiere elements 8, but no problems with my internet explorer 6.</s><s> i had this same problem with the photoshop elements 7/premiere elements 7 downloads last year. 
2. premiere elements 8 a. organizer.</s><s> i would take exception to steve grisetti's picture of the organizer in "what's new in premiere elements 8?", but maybe i was overly optimistic by "the most visible change to version 8 is that the organizer is no longer a sub-program of premiere elements and photoshop elements.</s><s> it now lives as its own, separate, pretty much independent program – behaving more than ever like its professional big brother, adobe bridge." he went on to say "in version 8, both programs have equal access to a single, full-featured organizer." 
</s><s>here is my dilemma for some who want a separate video and photo catalog.</s><s> if you had photoshop elements 7/premiere elements 7, you could create additional catalogs in photoshop elements 7.</s><s> premiere elements 7 could use one of these catalogs, but could not create new catalogs.</s><s> so then, you could have a photo catalog displaying in the photoshop elements 7 organizer and a video catalog displaying when you opened premiere elements 7.</s><s> you cannot do that anymore, and file menu/catalog is gone in premiere elements 8.</s><s> you still cannot create catalogs in premiere elements 8, so, if you just have premiere elements 8, you have one catalog.</s><s> if you have photoshop elements 8 and premiere elements 8, you can create additional catalogs in photoshop elements 8 that can be used in premiere elements 8, but these programs will display the same one catalog.</s><s> b. project presets.</s><s> the "new preset" button is gone.</s><s> the categories of the presets for ntsc and pal remain the same: avchd, dv, "hard disk, flash memory camcorder", hdv.</s><s> however, two choices have been added to the "hard disk, flash memory camcorder" categories.</s><s> now we have hd 1080i30, hd 1080i30 (60i), standard, and widescreen.</s><s> here i have a problem reconciling the names and the descriptions.</s><s> it was my understanding, in premiere elements 7 for standard and widescreen in this category, this preset category reverses the fields: from upper field first to lower field first in premiere elements edits.</s><s> so, now with these new choices described as follows: hd 1080i30: 1920 x 1080i; pixel aspect ratio = square pixels (1.0); camcorders like jvc gz-hd7; 16:9 interlaced hd video at 29:97 frames per second.</s><s> hd 1080i30 (60i): hd video from 1440 x 1080i camcorders; 16:9 interlaced hd video at 29:97 frames per second hdv 1080i anamorphic. 
</s><s>when thinking hd 1080i30 preset-.the jvc camcorder captures to a progressive sensor, assumed at 30 frames per second, and can record to it's built in hard drive as 1920 x 1080i with 30 frames per second each frame with 2 fields.</s><s> so, what prevents us from calling this preset hd 1080i30 (30p) square pixel? 
</s><s>when thinking hd 1080i30 (60i))-the camcorder involved captures to an interlaced sensor at 60 fields per second, and can record to it media as 1440 x 1080 with 30 frames per second, using a hd anamorphic.</s><s> so, what prevents us from calling this preset hd 1080i30 (60i) anamorphic? 
</s><s>when i start comparing preset choices, the only reason for using these "hard disk, flash memory camcorder" new choices appears to be, like for standard and widescreen, to have the fields reversed.</s><s> do you agree?</s><s> any comments on the nomenclature for these new preset choices? 
3.</s><s> adobe folder, folders and files if you go to the default location of the adobe folder (my documents\premiere elements\8.0), there are some differences there: for premiere elements 7 and earlier versions there were: adobe premiere elements previews folder encoded files folder media cache folder that piled up with conformed audio files (.cfa and .pek) project prel file styles folder and sometimes 2 .log files now in premiere elements 8, the media cache folder is gone and we have the arrangement: adobe premiere elements previews folder ca object track results encoded files layouts styles folder (you no longer see the endless conforming of dvd menus (not even used) at the beginning of the project.</s><s> but, i am still trying to figure out what they did with the conformed audio files (.cfa and .pek).</s><s> more on that next time, along with premiere elements 8 exports as well as photoshop elements 8/premiere elements 8 intergration.

<s>premiere elements 8 first look: part 2.         miscellaneous   1.</s><s> track arrangement.</s><s> (for standard 3 track setup) for those wishing for the good old days of premiere elements 2 where the line up, top to bottom, was: video track 3 video track 2 video track 1 audio track 1 audio track 2 audio track 3 (no narration track or soundtrack) the premiere elements 8 arrangement is the same as for premiere elements 7: video track 3 audio track 3 video track 2 audio track 2 video track 1 audio track 1 narration track soundtrack   2.</s><s> 5.1 channel sound vs stereo (2 channel) in premiere elements 7, if you had avchd or mpeg2 with 5.1 channel sound, your video could go to video track 4/audio track 4 with a tiny "5.1" to the left of the audio track.</s><s> that situation generated a lot of sceneline users complaints in this regard.</s><s> in the case of avchd with 5.1 channel, using the correct project preset could correct the situation.</s><s> in the case of mpeg2 with 5.1 channel, you worked in the timeline with your video and audio on those upper tracks.</s><s> now, right or wrong project preset (new project dialog), you can drag video with 5.1 channel sound to any track on the timeline.</s><s> however, the program continues to support the export of dolby digital stereo (2 channel sound), not 5.1 channel sound.   3.</s><s> opening premiere elements 8 scary moment the opening sequences goes: welcome screen (one of the friendliest welcome screen that i have come across) new project then a window opens with a menu bar across its top and everything else in the window gray.</s><s> i expected the gray in the window to be replaced with options/graphics.</s><s> no way.</s><s> so, next you click on file menu to reveal the drop down with: new open project open recent project   4.</s><s> project media tab as has been reported by steve grisetti, you need to click on organizer to see the project media tab, instead of edit mode as in premiere elements 7.</s><s> somehow the designers managed to leave access to the properties palette (via timeline icon or window menu/properties) the same as for premiere elements 7.   5.</s><s> cutting tools.</s><s> the split clip (scissor looking icon) to bottom right of monitor is still in the same place.</s><s> and, you still have access to the hidden razor tool by hitting c on the computer main keyboard to turn your mouse cursor into a razor (and hitting v to get yourself back to the safety of the timeline selection tool) trimming clips in the preview window with in and out points and generating subclips remain the same as in premiere elements 7.   6.</s><s> pop ups dragging media to timeline.</s><s> in premiere elements 7, there was only one of this kind, namely the videomerge one.</s><s> now there are two, the videomerge one and one called smart fix that asks "fix quality in clips" yes or no. both of these pop ups has a check off for "do not show again." i am not yet sure if it keeps that promise.   photoshop elements 8/premiere elements 8 integration with regard to slideshows   1.</s><s> in photoshop elements 8, under the create options, you will see included: a. slideshow that essentially stays the same as for photoshop elements 7, except that the output option (non .wmv) is now called "edit with premiere elements" instead of "send to premiere elements".</s><s> this option results in the availability of the premiere elements 8 command "break apart adobe photoshop elements slideshow".</s><s> b. dvd with menu this is an often misunderstood option which is the same as in photoshop elements 7. it accepts only videos as well as already created slideshows in the form of .wmv (save as a file, movie (.wmv) or slideshow project (slideshow saved to organizer without output; typically named with .psess file extension).</s><s> c. instant movie this is a new option, and it had be wondering for the longest time.</s><s> my interpretation of this is that the instant movie button is merely a launcher to premiere elements 8 where you select from the premiere elements 8 organizer media there (which is same as in photoshop elements 8) and then click on the premiere elements 8 instant movie feature to initiate the actual process.</s><s> as best i can tell at this point, it looks like it is intended for the person who is working in the photoshop elements 8 organizer and suddenly decides wouldn't it be a good idea to create an instant movie in premiere elements 8.</s><s> those exports choices looks like the next place to look into deeper.   atr

for play back on a psp, movies must include both audio and video.</s><s> movies exported with video only or audio only will not play back on the psp. - archival of projects with type 1 dv-avi files is not supported. - if standard definition menu templates are used when burning to bluray, menu images s will appear of low quality - when attempting to burn a bluray disc to a previously burned disc, you will see an error message indicating that the disc is incompatible, instead of an error message indicating the disc is full. - movies exported in h.264 format may have a few white frames added to the end - movies exported in mpeg2 format may be a few frames shorter than the original movie this seems to answer my question about photoshop elements 8/premiere element 8 integration regarding slideshows, but may be of more widespread interest to others for the other "known bugs" cited by adobe.   atr

<s>hunt 
</s><s>i cannot confirm the details that you presented.</s><s> i am not sure if there is some confusion on the part of the user between an early seen tab that says new project and the new project dialog itself.</s><s> because, once you have the new project "dialog" itself as you want it and click ok to it, it is a one way street to the opening of the premiere elements 8 workspace. 
</s><s>let me go over the step by step details to see if we can determine what is happening or not happening in the case of the user.</s><s> i am working from the tryout, so the routine should be the same, maybe plus or minus some tryout associated dialogs. 
1. click on the premiere elements 8 icon on the desktop.

<s>important add on regarding 5.1 channel sound support premiere elements 8 
</s><s>in an earlier addition to this thread, i wrote the following: 
2.</s><s> 5.1 channel sound vs stereo (2 channel) in premiere elements 7, if you had avchd or mpeg2 with 5.1 channel sound, your video could go to video track 4/audio track 4 with a tiny "5.1" to the left of the audio track.</s><s> that situation generated a lot of sceneline users complaints in this regard.</s><s> in the case of avchd with 5.1 channel, using the correct project preset could correct the situation.</s><s> in the case of mpeg2 with 5.1 channel, you worked in the timeline with your video and audio on those upper tracks.</s><s> now, right or wrong project preset (new project dialog), you can drag video with 5.1 channel sound to any track on the timeline.</s><s> however, the program continues to support the export of dolby digital stereo (2 channel sound), not 5.1 channel sound. 
</s><s>that last statement which i have placed in bold type needs to elaborated on. 
</s><s>further inspection of the program indicates that there are some 5.1 channel export routes available in this new version in a new export with the path share/personal computer/audio and share/personal computer/windows media.</s><s> my comprehensive overview of premiere elements 8 exports should be ready for posting here later today and will define where 5.1 channel sound is available for export and where it continues not to be available. 
</s><s>but, i thought this an important enough point to post this add on now for those reading the above before i get a chance to post my exports report.

<s>premiere elements 8 first look: exports part 3.</s><s> 

</s><s>edit mode: file menu/export 
</s><s>saving a titler created title as a .prtl file for future use in another project .prel is the same as in premiere elements 7.</s><s> you highlight the title file in the project media view, click on and use the file menu/export/title route.</s><s> in addition, you will have the original title embedded in the project .prel in which was created. 
</s><s>but now exporting/saving title is the only option under file menu/export; gone are the options for movie, frame, audio, and export to tape.</s><s> these appear to have been consolidated in the share section.</s><s> (details to follow.</s><s>) 
</s><s>share: categories: disc (burn dv and blu-ray discs) online (upload to video sharing) personal computer (export files for viewing on computer) mobile phones and players (export files for viewing on mobile phones and other devices) tape (record to dv or hdv tape) ------------------______________________________ disc same as premiere elements 7, in that 1.</s><s> share/disc/disc offers burn to dvd disc or burn to folder (4.7 gb or 8.5gb setting).</s><s> the audio of the export remains dolby digital stereo (2 channel), even if your timeline video imported with dolby digital 5.1 channel sound (also called ac-3).</s><s> 2. share/disc/blu-ray offers burn to a blu-ray disc with no option for burn to folder.</s><s> for an innovative workaround for that aspect, see robert johnston work on phantom burner http://muvipix.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=3896 ------------------------------_______________________________ online categories: photoshop.com (upload video to photoshop.com) youtube (upload video to youtube) podbean (podcast hosting) photoshop.com this appears to have non changeable preset components.</s><s> youtube this also appears to have non changeable preset components.</s><s> but it now has two preset choices: flash video for youtube flash video for youtube widescreen podbean this also appears to have non changeable preset components.</s><s> but it does offer four different presets of various quality levels. 
_________________________________ 
personal computer 

</s><s>categories: adobe flash video (use for posting on web pages) mpeg (use for playback on this pc or burning to dvd) avi (use for editing adobe premiere elements) windows media player (use for email and playback on windows pc) quicktime (use for email and playback on mac) image (use for exporting still image) audio (use for exporting audio) 
</s><s>adobe flash video the interesting thing here is that in premiere elements 7 i could import .swf files, but not .flv and .f4v files.</s><s> now in premiere elements 8, i can import .f4v as well as .swf files into the timeline, but not .flv. 
</s><s>also of note, in premiere elements 7 share/personal computer/adobe flash video, if you wanted to maintain a transparency in the video, you used the video on2vp6 with "encode alpha channel" checked (or at least you tried to) with flv choice selected.</s><s> the end result was often an error message saying "invalid argument".</s><s> most of the time, you had to go with the export with the "encode alpha channel" unchecked to avoid the error message.</s><s> if you tried to do this with f4v checked, there was no option available for "encode alpha channel".</s><s> now in premiere elements 8, the "encode alpha channel" option is gone altogether (flv or f4v). 
a usually successful alternative to exporting video and maintaining the transparency was via file menu/export/movie/microsoft avi with compression "none" and "color depth at "millions + of colors".</s><s> this route is no longer available in premiere elements 8 now that all avi export is now consolidated in share/personal computer/avi (what used to be share/personal computer/dv avi in version 7).</s><s> that microsoft avi in the new location in premiere elements 8 does not have a color depth option.</s><s> so, defining the procedure for maintaining transparency in a premiere elements 8 export needs to be done (work in progress). 
</s><s>mpeg everything remains the same in this category.</s><s> depending on the presets selected, the video codec is either mainconcept h.264 video or mainconcept mpeg video.</s><s> for those using h.264 hd 1080i30 or mpeg2 1080i30 or their pal counterparts, the file extension of the export is typically .m2t.</s><s> in "mpeg" category, there can be found options for dolby digital (ac-2) stereo audio, but none for dolby digital (ac-3) 5.1 channel audio or any other 5.1 channel audio with any other type of compression. 
</s><s>avi (consolidated category to include more than just dv avi as in premiere elements 7 with its file menu/export/movie and avi choices plus share/personal computer dv avi) this is a new consolidated category as mentioned previously and contains subcategories for: dv ntsc standard, dv ntsc widescreen, dv pal standard, dv pal widescreen, microsoft avi, and uncompressed microsoft avi. 
</s><s>further study is needed in what appears to be a loss of way to export video and maintain the video's transparency areas.</s><s> video and audio codec for this preset will be supplied on request.</s><s> there is no dolby digital (ac-3) 5.1 channel audio in this avi preset. 
</s><s>windows media this category contains video codec for hd1080i30, hd 1080i25, hd 720p25, hd 720p30, and four other categories that i will not go into.</s><s> the audio offerings for this category merit looking into.</s><s> accompanying those hd video codecs are audio codecs: windows media audio 10 professional windows media audio 9.2 windows media audio 9.2 lossless windows media audio voice 9 acep.net in premiere elements 7 only "2 channel choices" could be found depending on your audio codec choice.</s><s> now in premiere elements 8, you can find: windows media audio 10 professional-choices with varied bitrate, khz, and 2, 5.1, or 7.1 channel, etc. windows media audio 9.2 lossless-choices with varied bitrate, khz, and 2 or 5.1 channel, etc. 
</s><s>but here is the interesting point for me.</s><s> forgive me, audio engineers, for my limited working knowledge of audio.</s><s> when dolby digital, the audio compressor type, exists with 5.1 channel, that is typically referred to as ac-3.</s><s> so, since the windows media export is using the audio compressor type windows media audio 10 professional as the audio compressor (codec) with the audio format which includes 5.1 channel, it follows that premiere elements 8 is not offering dolby digital 5.1 channel (ac-3) in these options, but rather windows media audio 10 professional 5.1 channel.</s><s> in the comparison of the two, i am not sure at this point which ends up on top.</s><s> i did a quick search to see if i could find opinions.</s><s> here is one, maybe not the greatest, but it will give you an idea. http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070913112058aaljvxl 
audio 
this also is an interesting new consolidated category in this location of the program.</s><s> it offers presets for acc, aiff, mp3, and windows waveform.</s><s> under the advance button for each preset are numerous options for audio format, codec, and output channels.</s><s> and, yes, output channels = 5.1 channel can be found here, but we are not talking about ac-3.</s><s> for example, for the preset acc (advanced audio codec), one option is for audio format = aac, codec = aac, and output channels = 5.1 channels. 
.</s><s>at this point, i think that i can safely conclude that premiere elements 8 is now offering some audio formats including 5.1 channel audio with some of its exports, but definitely not dolby digital 5.1 channel (ac-3). 
i will conclude this section tomorrow with quicktime and image categories.

<s>jugemon76 
</s><s>i have been doing my evaluation of premiere elements 8 from the tryout version downloaded from adobe.</s><s> my computer operation system is windows xp professional sp3 (32 bit). 
</s><s>except for dvd templates and items like that, it has been my experience (versions 2, 6, and 7) that what you get in the tryout is what you will also get in the purchased version in the retail store or by making the purchase online. 
</s><s>as i stated earlier, the appearance in the opening sequence of that window with just the menu bar and everything else gray was a scary moment.</s><s> i waited and waited, thinking that it would dissolve into something else.</s><s> it did not.</s><s> that is when necessity forced me to try file menu where the new/project allowed for continued progress in opening the program (new project dialog, followed by workspace).
