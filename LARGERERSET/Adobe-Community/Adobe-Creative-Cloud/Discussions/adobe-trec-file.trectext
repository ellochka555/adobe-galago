<s>@fastnoc Ê i think that your so called "drama babies" are regular users who are experiencing not one but a myriad of issues with cc and adobe products in general since the move was made years ago to not only package multiple products but also release them on a highly-accelerated schedule.Ê i feel the most sorry for the development teams at adobe, as well as the customer support teams who have to keep up with the ridiculous pace that management pushes products out at.Ê i've never had so many headaches that caused such a loss in productivity since the creative cloud (our office uses almost all of the tools in the suite), and i can't imagine that i'm alone.</s><s> i've been running into this login issue for weeks and it breaks dynamic link whenever i'm exporting or importing a project.Ê i've tried the solution above, and now i need to sit and wait to see if it fixes it (for me, the issue only arises after adobe updates any component in the cc suite).Ê several updates have come out since the issue was first noticed, and frankly it's a bit unnerving to think about licensing issues or sign-in issues with the software.Ê this obviously isn't the case, but it's just an ongoing degradation of their reputation as a solid platform for multimedia production.Ê people are upset because they can remember a time when stupid little issues like this didn't exist, and the software just worked.

<s>or it could be patially related to typical pains when a company makes an enormous transition like this.</s><s> ironcially, just as i said in my post, my issue resolved the next day.</s><s> listen, i undertstand the concern and certainly the frustration.</s><s> i spend nothing short of 14 hours per day with adobe apps open. primarily after effects, photoshop and illustrator.</s><s> i know the hassle and i know the frustration of constantly having to sign back in, which i did for a bit too.</s><s> but it's just a little melodramatic when people make idle threats they aren't going to follow through with anyway, about using a product that does what this does, and is such an enormous productivity tool that people say silly things. that's what i'm referring to.</s><s> if you're going to choose an entire platform different than adobe becuase theyr'e having issues on a brand new method of service and delivery you're an idiot anyway.</s><s> wouldn't you agree that the statements of ' i don't have time to test something' are a litle ridiculous?</s><s> name any product, or purchase in any part of your life that has never failed at anything?</s><s> and then saying thigns like it's suddenly an unstable environment, when the problem they're complaining about (and the complaint of course it legitimate) has absolutely nothing to do with the stability of the product? Ê it's the overblown, silly statements that make people look foolish, do nothing to help the issue, and offer nothing that crack me up.</s><s> when i read someone saying things like that i pretty much ignore anything else they say because reason isn't something they are using at that point anyway. Ê see what you said?</s><s> that has nothing to do with anyone i'm talking about.</s><s> you made a valid point, didn't make silly comments like what i'm referring to. you said something i don't agree with, but you dind't go overboard and get all dramatic about it.</s><s> i don't agree that it's an ongoing degredation of their rep. there is nobody even remotely close a valid competitor out there for this in the first place (depending on what software yoiu're referring to, but since we're in the cc forum i assume that's what you mean).</s><s> the fact is, their reputation is so strong, no other software company can even compete.</s><s> but even so i still see progress and innovation.</s><s> intel had a cushion with no competitor at one point, then amd came in, and if you notice, within a couple years of amd getting very popular, intel started releasing their upgraded technology in less than a third of the time.</s><s> but i don't think i see that laziness from adobe.</s><s> i don't honestly know that the reason is they moved to a subscription based environment but i know that almost all big software companies are at leasdt considering it. heck microsoft was talking about changing their licensing and doing it the same way.</s><s> and it's not for greed i'd guess, it's to comabt theft.</s><s> at least that's my guess, i have no idea, but i don't believethat it's done and they would change their entire business model for a reason lefss important. Ê while we're on that topic i'd like to point out i bet this new process makes an enormous dent in the piracy, at least short term, so for me i applaud it. because when so many people steal the software, it means people like me, and i assume you, pay much higher prices for our legit licenses.</s><s> so anything that can be done to thwart that has my full approval.</s><s> but it also just happens to have some nice benefits, in that the pricing is pretty ridiculously low imo for the entire suite of apps for 50 bucks per month. let' be honest, anyone using them for business which is primarily what this softwre is geared to, understands that while it might seem high, it's tiny compared to the montly cost of doing business, to keep an up to date, suite full of apps that would cost thousands were it not for the subscription.</s><s> i'll admit, i bought the full suite on the montly just because it made sense.</s><s> and it actually paid off.</s><s> recently i had a client that desperately needed ihs forms migrated to interactive. they were word docs, excel and plain pdfs, but because i happen to have a license for acrobat, i was able to import those into pdf files and convert them to interactive forms.</s><s> then recommend he use the online service to manage them, and frankly it paid for 6 months of licensing for 10 hours work. were it not for the subscription based licensing i'd not have even been able to offer the service because i wouldn't have paid for acrobat. Ê complaining about a piece of software you buy that doesn't work in an area, regardless of where it is, makes perfect sense.</s><s> but the statements i'm referring to equate to someone buying a house, finding out the key doesn't work, or the doorknob is broke, throwing their hands up and saying 'i'm finding anohter house'. it's silly, and everyone knows there's no merit to it.</s><s> but i get frustrated seeing it over and over, frewquently by people that hven't even paid for the software.</s><s> sometimes i post thing i shouldn't but hey, don't we all? Ê i like to browse these forums becuse i'd say i've learned as much of my knowledge by reading tricks, tips and resolutions posted in forums as i did through my classes and education.</s><s> that's possibly an overstatement but not by much.</s><s> i do get just as frustrated at the people constantly trying to belitte the company as they do with their issues.

http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud/faq.html# 
-- do i need ongoing internet access to use my creative cloud desktop applications? 
no. your creative cloud desktop applications (such as photoshop and illustrator) are installed directly on your computer, so you won't need an ongoing internet connection to use them on a daily basis. 
</s><s>you will need to be online when you install and license your software.</s><s> if you have an annual membership, you'll be asked to connect to the web to validate your software licenses every 30 days.</s><s> however, you'll be able to use products for 99 days even if you're offline. -- 
(note, we are planning to expand this to 180 days.</s><s>) 
</s><s>so, you have to be online when you install, but after that, you only need to be online once every 3 months (99 days).

<s>in fact, to add to my previous post, most people's objections i have seen were because of their mistaken assumption that the creative cloud involved having to be constantly connected to the internet.</s><s> and many people believe the apps are actually hosted in the cloud!</s><s> none of that is true.</s><s> we've been very happy so far with creative cloud because with cc we've seen much faster release updates with new and better features and bug fixes than in the past and this has allowed us to create better results for our clients faster.</s><s> we've increased our profitability, the fixes and updates make the tools more enjoyable to use, our clients are happier, and adobe can just concentrate on making great products and improving them regularly rather than making some big splashy marketing push every two years just to make it seem worth upgrading.... with no ongoing feedback they get with the frequent cc releases.</s><s> and of course this means they get to see more regular income rather than big swings up and down depending on if its a release month/year or not and all the uncertainty involved in that type of release schedule.</s><s> sounds like a win-win-win situation to me. 
</s><s>as for the pricing, its cheaper than the master collection was (unless you don't update for about 4 years) plus provides access to more apps and features than the mc ever did.</s><s> but if you're still using 4 year old software in the web industry in particular, i really feel sorry for you and your clients.</s><s> it's like the companies that force their employees to use ie6 in 2013. 
</s><s>basically, the web and basically all things digital arew advancing far too fast for adobe to stick to the old slow method of updating software every 2 years.</s><s> by that time, whatever they had been working on over the 2 years could already be obsolete when it is released. 
</s><s>one of my favorite things about modern software and agile development is how fast updates and bug fixes come.</s><s> i open the app store on my iphone and there are always a bunch of apps waiting to be updated often with cool new features and bug fixes.</s><s> adobe themselves realized they needed to either get with the times or be left behind.</s><s> and incidentally, the same applies to you and your business as well. 
</s><s>and this might sound harsh but if you aren't making enough money to be able to afford $49 a month for all the tools you need to do pretty much any kind of creative work a client may ask for, it might be time for you to change to another line of work.</s><s> heck, the guy who does yard work in my neighborhood spends more than that a month on his tools. :-)

<s>first let me say that my earlier instructions for removing aam were only partially correct.</s><s> those instructions remove just the creative cloud part of aam and should really only be used if you are having trouble running aam with your creative cloud subscription.

<s>my issue with this error code started after trying to update a successful instillation of creative cloud.</s><s> during install, my screen went white and my computer froze, and i had to do a hard shut down.</s><s> after restarting, i got a prompt saying adobe creative cloud was having issues, but that the desktop manager was missing or damaged and needed to be reinstalled.</s><s> the desktop application for creative cloud was now missing from my top bar (mac os 10.7.5) and also from the folder "adobe creative cloud" in my applications folder.</s><s> only the uninstaller remained.</s><s> i tried clicking on the link in the prompt and downloading the creative cloud installer, but about halfway through after asking for password permission for adobe to make changes to my computer, i got the error code message "there was a problem with the installation (error code: a12e1).</s><s> for troubleshooting please go to the adobe support page." 
i did follow some of the advice on these forums, including restarting my computer and retrying the installation, only ot have the same result. 
i also tried renaming the oobe folder in the library as suggested in this thread, however that also did not work. 
i also checked the firewall issue that the user above mentioned, but found i have no firewall turned on on my machine, so this was not my issue. 
i resulted to calling support.</s><s> my support specialist walked through these same attempts before finding a solution that resolved the issue.</s><s> he used this: http://www.adobe.com/support/contact/cscleanertool.html to completely remove the creative cloud application (desktop application only - he did not remove or "clean up" my installed apps such as photoshop / indesign, etc). 
</s><s>after "cleaning up" the desktop application, he was able to run the creative cloud installer from the downloads area you get from logging into creative cloud on your browser, and successfully install it on my computer.</s><s> i would suggest doing this if you had this issue.</s><s> hope this is helpful and saves you the half an hour phone call!

<s>if adobe offered a respectable price for cc apps on a per application price and a "suite" combos. 
</s><s>if they are selling 17 apps for $50 a month, you should be able to get "suite" packages (web/print, video) for about $25/mo.</s><s> i would actually pay perpetually at that price point for the latest software, even through a subscription model.</s><s> it's all the software i want/need, but for them to throw 9 more applications in and force twice the price, it's just the epitome of idiocy. 
i can understand single apps being marginally more expensive, but it would be something like this: 
1 app, $15/mo each.</s><s> suite (web/print) or (video): $25/mo cloud (all apps) $50/mo 
</s><s>that would have been acceptable to me.</s><s> i'm not as against the subscription model (it has its flaws, and qa seems to be an afterthought), but their screwed up ala carte system is the reason why i'm refusing.

</s></quote>same for me here: long time adobe user (since photoshop v3), and nine months ago i decided to jump of the adobe bandwagon.</s><s> funny thing is, i also only use the flash plugin and that is the only software on my machine that crashes on a daily basis, often multiple times a day. 
</s><s>it is quite amazing how many loyal adobe users have decided to leave for new pastures.</s><s> i would have never left, if not for the stupendously irrate and insane decisions by adobe corporate management in the last five years or so.

</s></quote>for me, photoline has been an eye-opener to me.</s><s> none of the 3d or video bloat, and a strong focus on professional image editing features with a layer stack system that out-performs photoshop in many ways.</s><s> it's workflow is just better, in my opinion.</s><s> together with anime studio and manga studio i get superior painting and animation capabilities.</s><s> for 3d work blender and 3dcoat out-pace photoshop by light years. 
</s><s>honestly, dreamweaver and flash have been lacking and lagging compared to the competition for years now, and can easily be replaced by open source, free and commercial alternatives.</s><s> lightworks, avid, vegas: all great premiere alternatives.

</s><s>so do i hate adobe?</s><s> not really sure if hate is the right word.</s><s> however, i do feel disapointed in them and indeed also a distinct lack of trust and goodwill towards them as a company and as a brand.</s><s> if others feel the same, then this could be just as serious if not more so than just a matter of dollars, pounds, euro, yen, rupees, dinars, rands and rubles! 
</s><s>long term, a loss of goodwill can do a lot of damage to a brand even if the business behind it is still doing well financially in the short term.</s><s> people who use adobe products may well feel less loyalty and as a result will jump ship as soon as a viable alternativepresents itself.</s><s> i did with cd x6.</s><s> others may do the same with xara, gimp, ikskape and so on. 
</s><s>adobe's lack of a true justification or explaination of it's brave new world is also rapidly fuelling the anger and disquiet towards them.</s><s> not good. 
</s></quote>
</s><s>don't hate the brand name, or the hard-working developers and grunts of the company - the current negative mood is mostly caused by the corporate heads of adobe and the shareholders.</s><s> their first allegiance is to the god of money, not to adobe's customers.</s><s> this has caused adobe to become a soulless glutonnous behemoth on a road to self-destruction. 
</s><s>there is no good or evil in this: it is the natural outcome of a wisdomless greed for more and more money.</s><s> so the best approach to starve the "beast" is to take away its source of power: money.</s><s> vote with your wallet, and invest in alternatives. 
i foresee the good in the long run : all in all, this move by adobe corporate management forces the market to open up again to alternatives - which can only be a good thing!
