is going back to 2.7 out of the question?

i have moved your post to the ps express forum, where you will likely get quick assistance.

<s>hi.</s><s> 
</s><s>i wonder why photoshop express editor is not saving my edits here lately?</s><s>?</s><s> i still have at least 1.4 gb of free space remaining so that's not it.</s><s> i can get into the edit mode and go through the steps but then, when i click 'done' - it goes into the normal 'saving photo - please wait ...' but no further progression of the process.</s><s> in fact at this point, it's been saving for over 10 minutes. 
</s><s>yes, i have clicked the x and when it returns to my library, the changes are clearly not saved.</s><s> not that i thought it would be but i was hopeful. 
</s><s>any help out there for me?
