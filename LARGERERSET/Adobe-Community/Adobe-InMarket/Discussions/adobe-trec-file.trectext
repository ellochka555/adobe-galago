<subject>Does a purchased app get a unique registration id?</subject>
<post author="sparkplugXL" timestamp="Jun 28, 2011 11:57 PM">
<s>i have built an air app which i would like to publish, but this app depends on my web server to provide a service. 
i want the web server to be able to validate, or at least associate, the requests coming from each installed air app with a particular purchase, so that it is possible to meter usage (i.e.</s><s> max x gb transfer per week).</s><s> is this possible? 
i am hoping that the flow goes something like : 1) customer buys app on store and get a download (and adobe inject a unique registration id into the .air app?</s><s>).</s><s> 2) i am informed about a purchase via inmarket and provided with a registration id 3) when the app is used, it is able to report this registration id to the web server which can associate it with an internal list. 
</s><s>it also (from the docs) seems that i might be able to host the .air file on my webserver.</s><s> if the .air file were in fact a script which took care of stage 2 (as above) and dynamically compiled an individual .air file containing a unique key (and added that key to a database) it might work well, but in that case, i'd need to be sure requests were coming from the appropriate adobe server.</s><s> are there guarantees about the name or ip address range used by adobe for fetching remotely stored .air files? 
</s><s>if this isn't the case, how might i go about solving this basic problem without forcing the user (who will have just bought an app) into a registration process of my own devising on my website?

<s>turbidity: 
can you check the value of the applicationkey parameter in the checklicense() call and make sure that its a proper guid and does not contain any non-hex characters.</s><s> for example it should look something like this (in structure, not the values): e08c5839-86e4-4886-bd1e-10b9dafd9a96 and should only have characters from 0-9, a-f if it does not look like the above, please use the tool on the portal to generate one for you.

<s>that helps alot, i'll now have to re-think my business model as obviously inmarket is not the place i can be if i want to develop cutting edge air applications.</s><s> i truly appreciate the timeframe though, it gives me some solid info i can plan around. 
</s><s>i'm not sure i agree with the direction entirely, i think the monetization opportunities go down 10-fold by not allowing use of the native api's in 2.0. 
</s><s>with the native process api's the variety of application's we could build in air expanded exponentially, suddenly we can take advantage of thousands of pre-existing native processes to do all kinds of things that air can't do natively.</s><s> the possibilities are endless. 
</s><s>so, while you are focusing on reaching into new markets, you're limiting air apps to be simplistic in nature, and quite limited in functionality.</s><s> not to mention, it's a poor message to developers: here's this api we released, but it will be 18mths+ before we will actually support it in our own storefront. 
</s><s>i'm not really sure what one has to do with the other as well.</s><s> mobile/tabled and tv's will obviously not support native process anyways, so i don't see how adding support for native apps in desktop storefronts, should really affect the partnerships / development of these other storefronts. 
</s><s>it seems you guys are overthinking things.</s><s> start with getting the simple/basic stuff working properly, then you can conquer the world
