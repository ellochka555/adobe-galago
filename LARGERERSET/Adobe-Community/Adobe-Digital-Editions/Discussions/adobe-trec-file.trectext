<s>here is the trick: the "acsm" file is just the key to get access to your new ebook... so is like this --- key + door = ebook your key: acsm (file) your door: is the adobe digital edition http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/ your ebook: double click in your acsm (file) "after you install the adobe digital edition of course" and that's it...just remember to make the new adobe program work you have to sign in with adobe the installation wizard it will ask you for that good luck atte cirdatigo

<s>michael, if you are able to get to the site in the browser, but are still getting the 2038 error in de, the next most likely problem is that an application level firewall on your computer such as (but not limited to) zonealarm (windows) or little snitch (mac) is preventing de from making an outgoing http connection.</s><s> please check your computer configuration for any such programs and if they exist, enable outgoing connections for de.</s><s> another less likely possibility is that you are using a proxy connection to the internet, and have it set up correctly for your preferred browser but not for the system as a whole.</s><s> for instance if you are using firefox, also check to make sure can get to the site using ie (win) or safari (mac).</s><s> if this still doesn't work, i would suggest that you open up a support case, so that bentley and crew can get more information form you (and so that this can be tracked appropriately). -- jim lester adobe systems

</s><s>this is how i corrected the problem:

<s>just to clarify, there are two levels of authorization -- one for the ade software and one for the nook.</s><s> you have to use your adobe account to authorize both (and they have to be authorized with the same user name).</s><s> it sounded like your original problem (kcoline) was with the nook authorization, and it was the same problem the rest of us were having. 
</s><s>to get your files back, i suggest carefully reading over the "activation and authorization" section of the ade help.</s><s> it appears that ade will automatically find your files but note the "note" in quoted text below... http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/help/ 
</s><s>"after activation, any books, magazines, or other documents you previously bought with adobe acrobat¨ or reader¨ software are migrated to adobe digital editions.</s><s> this is usually a relatively quick process.</s><s> adobe digital editions opens each item and reverifies its license to the user.</s><s> if you don't have drm-protected items, you don't need to be online during the migration.</s><s> if you have a large number of items (for example, more than 100), then this process may take a while, but you will see a progress bar indicating the state of the migration as it proceeds.</s><s> note: items that you previously borrowed from a public library with adobe acrobat¨ or reader¨ software are not migrated to adobe digital editions.</s><s> you need to return the library item and then borrow the item again with digital editions." if it's not finding your files, it may be because they're located in a folder different from the one that ade is trying to use to find them. 
</s><s>you may also want to check the "transferring items between computers" section, as this describes where the files should be located, and how to reimport them into your library.

<s>i had tried everything posted on the message boards here and on b&n with no sucess.</s><s> finally, i called the local b&n store and they advised me that this problem occurred when they recently updated the simple touch software.</s><s> he suggested erasing and deregistering the device. 
</s><s>go to settings, then erase and deregister device 
this will wipe the nook clean.</s><s> (if you bought books from b&n, you can access them again by signing into your nook account, download to your computer and move them to your nook) 
re-register your device using the same b&n account info you first set it up with. 
</s><s>plug it into your computer, and move your library books over from ade.

<s>just fyi, according to barnes & noble's own "knowledgbase" they are aware of this problem.</s><s> at the bottom of a page discussing this problem, in a small note, is the following (word for word): 
</s><s>"note: you may be required to re-authorize the nook after any software update has occurred (i.e. updating nook color from version 1.4.1 to version 1.4.2).</s><s> any previously side loaded libary books will provide the "user not authorized" message when attempting to open after a software update." 
</s><s>in other words, barnes and noble is forcing users to go through this process of: deleting the folders and files for ade on the nook, deleting all their previously loaded library books from both the nook and ade, re-authorizing their nook, re-downloading their borrowed library books into ade, and then re-uploading those titles to their nook.</s><s> what fantastic customer service.</s><s> sarcasm noted, i hope.

<s>i just discovered this thread after sharing similar frustrations with ade and ipad.</s><s> the .ascm file that's created in your de directory on your computer when you buy a drm-protected book is just the key that unlocks the pdf of the book file, the one that you read within de.

<s>temporary solution: for everyone, if you can purchase the same pdf ebook title from any one source - vendor, distibutor, [your choice here] - that does not download only into the adobe(tm) digital editions software; then go for it. 
</s><s>preceding thought: from the top view, adobe is tackling international legal situations - which for this period in time, between 1989 (first burgeoning year of public internet access) and now 15 nov 2012 - is still an extreme newborn situation, those very few individuals who sincerely care for all cultures generally, relative to the total population of the entire earth are managing to guide this legal (appearance of a) nightmare. 
</s><s>the single most signficant peave i have is assuming one way is always the best way, this includes proprietary formats that do not use a single global multimedia interconnectivity standard in the core - which for reference the world wide web consortium ("w3c" colloquially) was created to help prevent mitigate the use of any one proprietary format and build a globally-connecting increasingly more simple to learn and use system of technical web languages. 
</s><s>however, from seeing (of those i experienced and not all inclusive) how apple, adobe, autodesk, amazon, and all small and medium sized business are interacting, all this cognitive dissoance is very similar globally how we as individuals are thinking locally; trying to "solve problems to simplify life". 
</s><s>if there is feature you would like to see, request through their feedback channels - constructively, not destructively; and with patience.</s><s> these modern tools are not easy for any one person alone to make. 
</s><s>sorry for the rant folks, early morning - past midnight -, a mind that works like a very very deep sponge, and a severely horizontal trans-disciplinary mindset.
