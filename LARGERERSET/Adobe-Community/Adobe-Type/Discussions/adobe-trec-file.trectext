<subject>Can I print/publish/sell my book if I buy an Adobe license for Helvetica?</subject>
<post author="Silk15" timestamp="Mar 21, 2014 6:46 AM">
<s>hello, Ê i'm wanting to self-publish a print book using the helvetica' neue std ultra light font which i can purchase the license for its use from the adobe store.</s><s> i'm just learning about licenses and commercial use, trying to get my head around it all.</s><s> so, if i buy the license for this font through adobe, does that mean i can publish/print my book and sell these books? Ê from what i can gather, all adobe fonts whether those that come with the bundle or those that a license is bought for through the store, are allowed to be used for commercial use.</s><s> correct me if i'm wrong.</s><s> it seems that this is all good for web and video stuff but i just wanted to see if it was okay for the printing and selling of novels?</s><s> i'm being pedantic but just want to be really explicit about these details so i don't have to worry about this legal stuff later. Ê also, if this is the case, then does that mean i can use any font that already comes with adobe in a book and sell the book?</s><s> e.g.</s><s> segoe print, arial unicode ms, freestyle script, etc. all of them, really.</s><s> specifically, i'm using indesign to create my books and want to use the fonts it comes with to save money if that's possible.

<s>for all fonts licensed from adobe either bundled with adobe applications or licensed separately via adobe's website or authorized resellers, there is no restriction whatsoever on using the font in books that you either print directory, print via pdf with fonts embedded, or distribute electronically as pdf.</s><s> there are some restrictions in terms of embedding fonts in epub files, but the adobe applications producing same take care of those restrictions (subset embedding and obfuscation) for you.</s><s> and you can sell these printed or electronic books to your heart's content with no extra restrictions, fees, royalties, etc. good luck in your venture! 
</s><s>in terms of the non-adobe fonts you specifically mention Ð segoe print, arial unicode ms, freestyle script Ð these are fonts that are installed with windows and/or microsoft office, not adobe applications.</s><s> at adobe we cannot comment on the legality of use of these fonts as you describe.</s><s> that having been said, the font files are physically marked to permit "preview and print embedding" for output.</s><s> and many users do commonly use them for publishing.</s><s> for a legal opinion on this, you would need to obtain the eula (end user license agreement) for the fonts from microsoft.

<s>look at <http://www.adobe.com/products/type/creative-cloud-fonts.html> to see lists of fonts installed by adobe creative cloud software. 
</s><s>arial unicode and some other fonts appear in separate lists due to significant differences in their character sets.</s><s> the main list contains fonts that are primarily western latin character sets.</s><s> asian fonts of symbolic fonts (based on how they declare themselves) are in separate lists.</s><s> arial unicde attempts to support many unicode character sets and is thus not in the main list.

<s>oh, cool.</s><s> thanks for that - very helpful. Ê okay, so was wondering if you could take a look at this: Ê "embedding font software and representations of typeface and typographic designs and ornaments.</s><s> you may embed the font software only into an electronic document that is not a commercial product, (ii) is distributed in a secure format that does not permit the extraction of the embedded font software, and (iii) in the case where a recipient of an electronic document is able to use the font software for editing, only if the recipient of such document is within your licensed unit.</s><s> you may embed static graphic images into an electronic document, including a commercial product, (for example, a "gif") with a representation of a typeface and typographic design or ornament created with the font software as long as such images are not used as a replacement for font software, i.e. as long as the representations do not correspond to individual glyphs of the font software and may not be individually addressed by the document to render such designs and ornaments." Ê it's the only part in the eula where it refers to commercial use so i'm hoping i'm looking in the right place.</s><s> the language used doesn't help me all that much since i get confused not knowing if it means the actual software and/or the font itself printed on a page. Ê from the above, does it look like i can safely print and sell books if i agreed to the terms in this license and bought it?</s><s> or do i need more info before making a call? Ê thanks heaps.

<s>for your information, christopher slye is a long time member of adobe's type development organization and he does know what he is talking about! 
</s><s>itc, currently owned by monotype, licensed its styles to a number of different foundries, adobe being one of them.</s><s> when you license any itc font from adobe, a royalty is paid by adobe to monotype.</s><s> your use of the font is subject to the eula (end user license agreement) from adobe.</s><s> however, if you licensed the font from bitstream, monotype, itc, or other vendors, you are subject to a eula which may be (and probably is) very different from that of adobe.

<s>if you're on a mac, i find the info section in font book to be very helpful.</s><s> the eula is still needed, but some basic info can be seen here.</s><s> go to preview menu > show font info. although i use fontagent pro, i will sometimes put a font into my user > library > fonts folder just to see the additional info about it in font book.</s><s> i then remove the font so i don't have issues with it being installed in two places. 
</s><s>here's a screenshot of what i see with my version of itc avant garde gothic std, just as an example: 


</s><s>the eula is your most important piece of information.</s><s> without the eula that came with your particular fonts, it's really hard to know for sure what you can and cannot do with your fonts and be in legal compliance.</s><s> there are obviously many places you could have gotten them, such as part of fontfolio, part of a software package, or purchased individually from a variety of foundries.</s><s> to keep us on our toes, each foundry has their own unique language and terms. 
</s><s>over the past 16 years, i have purchased fonts from over 150 different foundries, and i actually read the eulas!</s><s> i have to for my job, since i purchase and manage the font licenses for over 600 artists in 20 locations across 5 countries.</s><s> i don't have a copyright law degree (boy, that would come in handy!</s><s>!</s><s>), so i find wading through these agreements to be tedious and difficult at times, and i do it everyday, so i can imagine how hard it is for someone who reads one occassionally.</s><s> the language around embedding is especially tricky, but i'm finding most desktop licenses allow embedding in a document, but they will vary in regard to additional restrictions that might need to be in place.</s><s> for instance, many eulas allow pdf embedding as long as the file is secure and set to view and print only.</s><s> there are many variations on that alone. 
</s><s>it's possible, but would not be common, for a desktop license to cover embedding the fonts into an application.</s><s> berthold fonts, for instance, require a special license for ipad use even if the fonts are rasterized!</s><s> (i just walked one of our clients through this specific type of purchase yesterday).</s><s> with so much variation, it can be downright overwhelming at times to keep up on what you can and cannot do with each of your fonts. 
</s><s>an important question for kossos007 would be - does the foundry consider what you're creating to be an application or a document.</s><s> it sounds "to me" like you're creating an application.</s><s> when i click the link provided above about adobe air, it says "application" over and over again in the text, but the foundry is often who determines this based on the info you give them about your project.</s><s> with so many ways to embed fonts, i think it scares the foundries a bit as they are also learning along the way about all these new technologies.</s><s> their goal is to make sure their product is secure and cannot be extracted, and then pirated. 
</s><s>these types of license questions are never easy, and i'm sorry for making it seem too cut and dry in my response.</s><s> i definitely made some assumptions about the question, and did not mean to overly simplify it.</s><s> it's not easy to get at this type of info.</s><s> i have searched for awhile to find a resource where i could look at a list of foundries and see a summary of their basic usage rights, such as various forms of embedding.</s><s> i could not find anything, so i'm currently making my own database from the eulas that have come with my font license purchases.</s><s> there are 170 of them so far, so it's a huge project, but i think it will be a very valuable resource for me, and hopefully others when i get it done.

</s><s>also, i've only been pursuing this so hard because the project i'm designing is a large one for a large client and they like straight answers.</s><s> i need to beat this horse till it's dead because i have to be able to explain to the client that we can't use their brand font and here's why.</s><s> i've had a webfont replacement ready since before i even started this journey.</s><s> so it looks like we'll be going with plan b.

<s>mario, 
</s><s>there is absolutely nothing underhanded about what ben is telling you. 
</s><s>there are two ways you can use the typekit fonts for print publishing workflows. 
(1) the first way is to compose in indesign with the typekit fonts as you would with any fonts that you have otherwise licensed and have installed on your desktop system.</s><s> for the purposes of printing, export pdf (preferably pdf/x-4 settings) and send the resultant pdf file to your print service provider.</s><s> all the typekit fonts are properly embedded in the pdf file and your print service provider should have no issues with printing the text formatted with said fonts. 
(2) the second method assumes that your print service provider (or some intermediary) is going to be doing further edits to your work before producing the pdf file that you would have created per (1) above.</s><s> typically you would "package" such documents into a directory structure that copies linked content and fonts.</s><s> the only difference with the typekit fonts is that such fonts are not included in the package.</s><s> but since whoever is going to do those further edits and/or pdf export also needs the cc version of indesign, they will also have access to the same typekit fonts that you do via the creative cloud software.</s><s> there is no need to package the fonts from them.</s><s> if they have older cs versions of indesign, they will not be able to open your cc version indesign document anyway.

1- the wavy line (madda) above the "alef", when used with "lam" (l) the madda goes below the "alef" (the madda is always above the "alef".</s><s> see attached image, the red is the correct placement. 

2- same problem for hamza, when used above "alef" when the letter joined with "lam" it goes below the "alef".</s><s> see attached 


3- the third problem is just when ligature is on.</s><s> the letter "yeh" when it connect with "teh", "feh", "beh" it becomes wrong.</s><s> see attached example of feh (f) + yeh (y) 


4- is a problem with the dot of the "bah" (b).</s><s> when the "bah" comes after a "lam (l) the dot falls very low see attached file. 



5- another problem is with diacritics, whenever is used on a ligature character, they overlaps.</s><s> however this can be fixed with controlling the diacritics horizontally. 
6- is a wish.</s><s> can we have an alternate glyph for the "mim" m when it's at the end of a word?</s><s> the reason i'm asking is because i work in education and the font is excellent for use in educational books because of its legibality, and cleanliness.</s><s> however the font got rejected from schools because the "mim" (m) (when it is a the end of the word) it's not very obvious for kids.</s><s> the shape is more stylistic than traditional and it get confused by kids for a "ra" (r). see attached sample. 


</s><s>hope that helps?</s><s> let me know if i can help further.

although lots of designers use trajan at smaller sizes, it wasn't designed to be used that way.</s><s> if you check out the browser samples for trajan pro 3, you will see the there are rendering issues in windows below about 30px: https://typekit.com/fonts/trajan-pro-3#browser-samples 
you might try something like minion instead.</s><s> see the example (with code) in that same blog post. 
</s><s>or, if minion pro is not to your liking, there similar serifs in the library that are recommended for paragraph use: https://typekit.com/fonts?classification=serif&contrast=regular&recomm ended-for=paragraphs&weight=regular&width=regular these fonts that have been hand-picked by typekit's staff for their technical and aesthetic excellence, and they render excellently across all browsers and devices, including windows.

<s>unless you get the font file itself from whoever created or last worked on the document and used that font (assuming that the font is either an opentype or a windows format truetype font and that you can legally use the font), you may need to separately license helvetica neue from any one of the font foundries with a helvetica neue family.</s><s> the name might not match exactly (actually, probably won't match exactly) and you may need to make adjustments in your document to use name of the font that you do license. 
</s><s>fwiw, your experience is not uncommon.</s><s> there are hundreds of different variants of helvetica, times, arial, etc. that share the same names, but are slightly different.</s><s> in this particular case, having a slightly different name is probably for the best if you can't get the exact same font, because it will force you to look for any problems that the replacement font may cause (slightly different metrics, styles, etc.</s><s>).</s><s> 
</s><s>as far as i know, apple does not license its version of helveticaneue for use on other platforms and even if the font is in opentype or windows truetype format and could be copied to a windows system, you are probably in violation of the licensing conditions for that font under macos x. the closest you may come to the exact helveticatneue on the macintosh may be available from monotype or linotype on-line at their web sites.

<s>although we at adobe certainly do recommend use of opentype font technology going forward and especially for new publishing projects for any number of very good reasons, adobe does continue to fully support type 1 fonts (fwiw, truetype and opentype fonts are every bit as much postscript fonts as type 1 or type 3 fonts are) in all our applications as well as in our adobe postscript and adobe pdf print engine products and has committed to do so for the indefinite future. 
</s><s>in fact, adobe still does license and ship type 1 fonts in fairly high quantities.</s><s> every printer sold with adobe postscript 3 by adobe's oem partners such as xerox, ricoh, canon, oc, efi, etc. is accompanied with host software that includes the windows and macintosh host versions of all the type 1 fonts that are also printer resident. 
</s><s>actually, the problem that the op of this thread was experiencing is that apparently, the adobe type basics was built without the .pfm files that normally were shipped with all adobe type packages for windows.</s><s> when atm was required for installation of those fonts, since atm had the capability of building .pfm files on-the-fly, this omission wasn't noticed at the time by most users (even i wasn't aware of it until today).</s><s> otherwise, there was nothing wrong with those fonts and there was nothing about them that was "showing their age." 
</s><s>unfortunately, the adobe type basics opentype edition is not a superset of the fonts in the original adobe type basics product.</s><s> many of the font families of the original product were replaced by totally different font families.</s><s> updating to the opentype-based product would not have solved the op's problem without possibly needing to license a whole bunch of additional font families individually, possibly costing more than the $99 for the adobe type basics opentype edition itself.</s><s> for existing content (including templates and artwork), it is not simple to move from type 1 to opentype without going through existing content and globally changing all font references.</s><s> the opentype versions of adobe's font do not have the same names as the type 1 versions - this was not an oversight, but done for good reason since there are differences between the products in encoding and metrics that could in some cases cause layout issues.

<s>por cierto, para activar y desactivar fuentes, as como para ordenarlas, puedes usar la ltima version de suitcase, que creo es la 11 o algo as, o bien un programa mucho mejor que se llama font agent pro.</s><s> el font book que viene con la pantera (os x.3.3) te sirve si no tienes demasiadas fuentes, pero si tienes centenares o miles de ellas es indispensable comprar font agent pro o algo similar.

<s>ramon te agradezco tu respuesta, por el momento te puedo decir que el problema no creo que sea la impresora, ya que manejo un rip de la bestcolor que manda a imprimir a un plotter epson 7000, en el cual salieron mal las tipografias, ademas de que mande a imprimir en una maquina llamada prossetter, la cual imprime lminas para impresion en esta maquina salieron igual mal las letras, por lo que no me inclinaria tanto por ese lado, ahora bien la gente de preprensa me comenta que el problema pueda ser que las letras que nos mandan los clientes no vengan completas, ya ves que en postcript se manejan como dos versiones la de previsualizacion y la de impresion y dicen que por ahi esta el problema lo cual corregia anteriormente el atm.</s><s> me comentaste del font agent pro, este programa soluciona o hace funciones similares al atm?

<s>>font agent pro, este programa soluciona o hace funciones similares al atm?</s><s> por lo que toca a las funciones de activar o desactivar las diferentes "fuentes" o tipografas, s.</s><s> en cuanto a la previsualizacion, ya quedamos en que no es necesaria en os x.</s><s> > en postcript se manejan como dos versiones la de previsualizacion y la de impresion las tipografas ps tipo 1 efectivamente constan de dos ficheros, el de la impresin (outline printer font) y el de pantalla (bitmap font).</s><s> si tienes instalado el primero (outline printer font) el sistema os x se encarga de hacer la previsualizacin y la impresin a partir de ah; la otra parte (screen bitmap font) slo sirve para que el sistema "vea" o localize la tipografa.</s><s> si solamente tienes esta segunda parte (screen bitmap font) etonces s vas a obtener resultados fatales en la impresin.</s><s> por cierto, aun en el sistema 9 y anteriores era absolutamente indispensable tener los dos ficheros juntos ("(outline printer font" y "screen bitmap font") para que atm pudiera cumplir su funcin.</s><s> no queda de otra.</s><s> esto es lo que el os x hace automticamente.</s><s> tambin es posible que tengas la nueva modalidad de tipografas, open type fonts (.otf).</s><s> si ste es tu caso, entonces dile adis a quarkxpress.</s><s> quarkxpress no entiende nada de este nuevo formato.</s><s> te aconsejo abandonar a quark de cualquier manera.</s><s> adobe indesign es infinitamente superior, y que conste que yo no trabajo para adobe ni tengo nign otro nexo comercial con ellos salvo el de cliente y consumidor.
