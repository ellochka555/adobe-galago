<subject>Parsing CFF blocks but getting different width from bounding box</subject>
<post author="Mopaxian" timestamp="Sep 27, 2010 8:11 AM">
<s>hi, 
</s><s>i'm writing an opentype parser, and right now while parsing cff blocks using adobe's kozuka mincho pro r font, version 4.001, i am getting strange results: the width values that i find for glyphs based on the charstring appear to be the right values, but when i do a quick svg verification, making a rectangle with the glyph's width and then drawing the glyph inside it, the width of the bounding box for the character and the indicated glyph width do not match. 
</s><s>for instance, the glyph for plain lowercase latin 'j', index 75, has the follow charstring according to "tx": 
[tx -6 -g 75 kozminpror.otf] 

## glyph[tag] {cid,ifd,languagegroup,path} glyph[75] {75,12,0, 266 width ... endchar} 

</s><s>when i fetch the data associated with this letter, my parser gives me the following data: 

{"letter":"j", "width": 266, "height": 970, "baseline" : 880, "bounds" : [-107,-268,189,702], "path" : "m139 702c-29 0-50-25-50 -64c0-39 21-63 50-63c29 0 50 24 50 63c0 35-18 64-50 64m46-194l-10 6c-45-26-78-38-142-47l0-24c70 0 74-1 74-68l0-339c0-115-6-269- 87-269c-21 0-37 12-51 39c-13 25-23 41-47 41c-18 0-29-12-29-30c0-41 57-85 125-85c149 0 167 163 167 310"} 

</s><s>in this result, "path" is simply a compacted svg path string based on the path instructions in the type2 charstring, and the "bounds" array is derived from simply running through the path and recording min/max bound values for x/y.</s><s> ("height" is based on the bounds, "baseline" is the vertoriginy from the vorg table associated with the character's glyph index). 
</s><s>for this glyph, the indicated width is actually smaller than the width of the vector drawing that results from interpreting the outline data. 
</s><s>if i open photoshop, and write the letter "j" using the kozuka mincho pro font, with weight "r", at a pointsize 1000 (to match the quad size for this font) then the width as indicated by the text cursor is 266 pixels, but the bounding box for the character when picking "free transform" has a width of 374 pixels.</s><s> where are these 108 pixels recorded in the font? 
</s><s>i'm currently using {fontdict->nominalwidth + charstring diff. with nominal} for width (or if there is no width value in the charstring, the fontdict's default width value) and base the glyph's bounding box on the vector-trace of the outline data - am i forgetting something in order to get the correct width/bounds?

<s>no, this question is very different. 
</s><s>i'm getting all the charstring information correctly, my interpretation matches what tx claims the interpretation should be, but somehow the width value derived from the charstring is not enough.</s><s> there's an extra 108 pixels somewhere that determines the visual width, and i don't know where they're located.</s><s> if i use max(charstring width, boundingbox width) then i still don't get to the width that adobe's type manager gives when doing a free transform of the letter in photoshop. 
charstring width: 266 units bounding box width: 296 units (already wider than the glyph width indicates) full width according to type manager: 374 units 
note that this real width exists even in the absence of other characters, so it's not derived from a specific kerning pair.

<s>yes, a character code may appear in multiple cmap subtables.</s><s> see the opentype spec: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/cmap.htm which cmap subtable you would use to access the character would depend on your particular needs.</s><s> what kind of codepoint are you trying to look up the glyph with?</s><s> you say "cmap0" and "cmap4" but you don't specify whether the 0 and 4 refer to platform, encoding, or format.</s><s> i'm going to guess that you are referring to format 0 and format 4.</s><s> first, i would say that one would normally pick a cmap based first on platform/encoding, and only secondarily on format.</s><s> cmap format 0 is an old apple format, limited to 256 encoded glyphs, seen in conjunction with platform=specific encoding(s), notably macroman.</s><s> format 4 is one of several ways of representing unicode codepoints, with the limitation that it can only deal with codepoints in the basic multilingual plane or bmp.</s><s> cheers, t

<s>to work with volt and cff fonts: - build the ps font in fontlab.</s><s> make sure you can build an otf font without the glyph order changing;the otf-building process will force the glyphs with adobe standard names into a standard order.</s><s> the easiest way to avoid glyph order changes may be to save the otf font, and then re-import it. - use fontlab to convert the font to truetype, and save it as a tt font - use volt to build all the featurs for this font - use the otftableeditor tool to copy the gsub and gpos tables from the ttf font to the otf font.</s><s> note that these tables reference the glyph by glyph index.</s><s> this is why it is important that the glyph order in the ttf font be exactly the same as in the otf font.</s><s> this is all prety clunky, but i don't know a better way.</s><s> i would be very interested to know how to hand-code gsub/gpos features.

<s>thanks read.</s><s> i tried volt, it is a bit complicated and i would need to work on two different machines, after i buy the pc.</s><s> i know hand-coding seems much more complicated and you don't see the results as you work, but once you get everything setup it is as fast as copy/paste/type.</s><s> there is a program that converts the font tt or cff to xml and back, it is called ttx you can find it at http://www.letterror.com/code/ttx/ i will need to spend some time learning the syntax and all, but i believe i can do it.
