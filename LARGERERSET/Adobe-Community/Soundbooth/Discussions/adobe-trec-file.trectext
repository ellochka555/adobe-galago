<s>hi yves, 
</s><s>i see this is a couple weeks ago but will add a response in case it's helpful. 
</s><s>first, i would recommend audition over soundbooth.</s><s> adobe have discontinued southbooth in favour of audition. 
</s><s>with audio, you can get rid of background noise like clicks or other types of sound.</s><s> getting rid of a sound is easier if it's different from the sound you want to keep.</s><s> for example, if there is a car beeping behind some voice, you may be able to get rid of the beep.</s><s> or perhaps is a constant fan noise behind a speaker.</s><s> if you have a recording of say an interview at a coffee shop and there are conversations in the background, that will be very hard to clean up.</s><s> i have tried with this exact audio type.</s><s> the problem is if you try remove background sounds it distorts the foreground sound too.</s><s> so, always best to minimise the background noise when doing a recording. 
</s><s>to soundbooth - there are cleanup capabilities under processes.</s><s> you can do things from the task options.</s><s> audion has a few options to separate singing/voice audio from music.</s><s> is not a simple task to get a perfect result though.

<s>when soundbooth was first developed, it had a few extra things than what were not available in audition.</s><s> however, audition remained the more high end sound editing tool.</s><s> soundbooth was locked to a multiple channel editing approach.</s><s> in audition, single editing is easy - you simply click the l or r at the right end of the sound channel to lock it and then you can edit the other channel only.   soundbooth has been discontinued and audition now has taken its place from cs6 to the creative cloud.   the above is some background info. to your current situation, you can use a workaround like: * export your audio file to separate channels by file > export > channels to mono files.</s><s> you will get 2 files with _l and _r suffix.   you can then edit them separately.</s><s> you can go from mono to stereo by the following step.   or   * choose - edit > insert > channels  into new multitrack file.</s><s> that will separate the left and right channels and add them to a new multitrack file.     you can then click the edit link at the top right of the channel to edit it.   you can then save that file as a new audio file.   dean

<s>thanks, chip.</s><s> those errors when attempting to connect to the ip address seem to indicate that you're able to make the physical network connection since it's the webserver that's saying "invalid url." that indicates the issue probably lies with the dns resolution.</s><s> (you're probably aware of this, but for others who are following this thread, dns resolution is the process where your computer converts the easy to remember website name, such as "www.adobe.com" to the string of numbers it actually uses behind-the-scenes.</s><s>) the dns resolution is usually performed by your computer contacting your isp's name server, which returns the numerical address based on its own database, or contacts adobe.com's servers to find out the current address.</s><s> there may be a method to test if this is absolutely the case by updating windows's "hosts" file, which allows manual configuration of name and ip address.</s><s> let me investigate a little further before i recommend that step as it would only be a temporary solution and is a little bit involved.</s><s> durin

<s>found this free easy to use mp3 converter called all2lame, here: http://members.home.nl/w.speek/all2lame.htm you will also need to download lame mp3 encoder, and copy the lame.exe & the lame_enc.dll files into the all2lame directory to get it to work: http://www.rarewares.org/mp3-lame-bundle.php the program offers a lot of command line type options, so you need to read the documentation to understand all your choices, but here's a 'quickstart' line you can put into the 'switches' line that will make highest quality stereo mp3's using variable bit rate technique: --vbr-new -v 0 -q 0 --resample 44.1 if you prefer mono to save space, use this line: --vbr-new -v 0 -q 0 -m m --resample 44.1

<s>i just want to mention my two cents on this general subject in hopes that it'll get factored in to some small degree somewhere along the development line.</s><s> since it seems very unlikely any audio software will ever dethrone protools as the undisputed choice for audio pros, i suspect a large percentage of audition and/or soundbooth users are not dedicated audio pros, but video pros who also need a way to work with "that squeaky stuff that goes along with the pictures".</s><s> for that reason, ease-of-use is just as important as a feature-rich product, which is why, as much as i hate to admit it since i'm a long-time die-hard fan of all adobe products, i actually still use sound forge for my audio work more often than audition or soundbooth ... largely because i got to know it well before adobe offered any audio tools at all and i bet i'm not the only one that scenario applies to.</s><s> just something to consider ... thanks for reading my ramblings.</s><s> cheers!</s><s>

<s>soundbooth is to the point of useless, adobe reduces features, i still use audition 2.0 because either soundbooth can't do it or you can't find it in the menu structure.</s><s> adobe is doing the same thing as microsoft.</s><s> they have a product that works but it almost seems like they try to break it for continued users. 
</s><s>soundbooth cs4 can't import a cd...</s><s> wtf is that all about?</s><s> i searched help and it is nowhere.</s><s> so back to audition 2.0 again !</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s> 
</s><s>i bought the master suite to get all the best but no...</s><s> i got soundbooth instead

<s>i have to agree with the troll.</s><s> if we are spending a lot of money on the "master collection" we should be getting the very best of tools.</s><s> not a watered down version of audition being soundbooth.</s><s> that like giving us photoshop elements instead of the full version because "it's to difficult" for the lamen.</s><s> if someone is purchasing the master collection he/she is obviously not a lamen and wants the very best of tools.

<s>after a few donald duck tantrums over using soundbooth, i relented and took the lynda.com soundbooth course.</s><s> this served to show me that soundbooth is a capable and powerful program.</s><s> i still prefer audition.</s><s> the soundbooth user interface is, at best, counter-intuitive. 
</s><s>let's take the everyday task of balancing the sound on left & right stereo channels.</s><s> there is an unanswered user post in this forum dealing with this specific soundbooth issue.</s><s> in audition, one clicks the top (left channel) of the channel display to select the channel, highlight the waveform for amplification or attenuation, and save.</s><s> in soundbooth, this simple task doesn't seem to be an option.</s><s> does one have to move the stereo clip into the multi-channel editor, copy the channel, and then remix?</s><s> i don't know, i haven't tried it, because i move the sound file over from my mac adobe to pc audition to fix the sound. 
</s><s>not an elegant solution, adobe. 
</s><s>i'd like a mac version of audition and it should have been included in the cs5 master collection. 
</s><s>anyone listening?
