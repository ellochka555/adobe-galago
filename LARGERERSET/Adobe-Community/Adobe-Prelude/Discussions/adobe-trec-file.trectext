<subject>Prelude takes a long time to open a (new) project file</subject>
<post author="mrtorrent" timestamp="Mar 21, 2014 8:53 AM">
<s>hi, 
</s><s>i'm trying out prelude, and i've created a new project and ingested (via link) about 20 hours of canon xf footage in about 1000 files from an internal hard drive.</s><s> all the media loaded correctly and all the audio peak files were generated. 
</s><s>when i close and reopen prelude and try to open that project, the "loading project" window pops up, the progress bar proceeds to completion over a few seconds, and the window goes away.</s><s> the issue is that prelude is then unresponsive for the next ten or fifteen minutes!</s><s> i can see the entire interface, but nothing responds.</s><s> i can see the clips listed, but their thumbnails are not loaded.</s><s> windows system monitor tells me prelude is actively using cpu and accessing the disk.</s><s> after 10-15 minutes, the thumbnails appear and i'm able to use prelude, but this seems like a long time to load a not-so-big project on a pretty new system.</s><s> is this normal? 
</s><s>my system has one of the new i7-4770k processors, 16 gb of ram, a samsung 840 ssd for the system drive, and an internal seagate 3tb 7200 rpm drive as the media drive for this project, so i would expect loading to be pretty snappy.</s><s> while prelude is unresponsive, system monitor shows it using 15-20% cpu, 11 gb of ram, and only 5-10 mb/s disk access.</s><s> i've tried recreating the project file from scratch several times, with the same result every time. 
</s><s>is this wait time normal?</s><s> is there any way i can speed it up? 
</s><s>if it's still loading, it seems like it should provide some feedback about that, too.

<s>prelude, in my eyes, allows a user to be more efficient by simplifying the user interface and lower the system specs for broader hardware use in the field for logging and rough cutting.</s><s> what prelude doesn't really do is present powerful features for someone in the field or that allow someone already in the edit bay to kill a lot of work easily. 
</s><s>i've already submitted some of these as feature requests but i hope to gain some support by posting here. https://www.adobe.com/go/wish/

</s><s>for example, if we shoot at 60fps, create subclips, bring into premiere and re-interpret at 24fps for slow motion then the in and out points of the subclips have been shifted.</s><s> they become useless. 
2) the ability to sync second system audio 
look at redcine-x and how it implements sync.</s><s> it matches second system audio by comparing timecode.</s><s> if timecode is off then you can choose an audio file to associate to the video file and then sync by finding the slate in video, pressing the slate icon, and then finding the clap in the audio waveform and hitting the slate button.</s><s> this shifts the audio so the clap matches the slate.</s><s> the audio/video file association is also saved in metadata. 
3) the ability to add a lut and burn-in metadata to truly create dailies/rushes 
look at speedgrade for functionality.</s><s> while speedgrade *could* do this, adding this feature along with audio sync to prelude is truly the way to go; it matches the featureset for offload/logging quite well and would make it an invaluable tool in the field.

1) batch ingest with subclipping.</s><s> at first this wasn't jumping at me, but then ...</s><s> i realized ... that much of what i do really needs a few seconds out of a say 30-second clip, and i will never use the rest of that clip.</s><s> if i rough-marked clips in a "preview" mode, then could just ingest those selected sections ... that would be a huge time & space saver.</s><s> i'd use this every dang project. 
2) story-board view for creating rough cuts ...</s><s> i'm such a visual thinker, this would be marvelous ... 
3) match prpro's project panel ... yea, that would be a great thing too.</s><s> workflow needs to flow ... 
4) apply lut's both versions ... yes.</s><s> it would be a huge help for those pushing 'dailies' out all the time, and even for the "hybrid" product people like much of my work is ...

</s><s>my dream workflow would be: id subclips from raw riles ingest those subclips tag, rate, label those subclips have access to entire library of all clips ever ingested quickly search/assemble clips rought cut and toss into premiere for the heavy editing. 
</s><s>it's the lightroom -> photoshop analog that nearly every dslr videographer is familiar with, and it'd absolutely rock! 
</s><s>i'd initially thought that the latest version of prelude would accomplish what i needed...but as soon as i started to bring in everything, the project size expanded and it started to get slow. 
</s><s>premiere and prelude both have great subclipping abilities, but you really can't find/use those subclips (or that time/work) outside of the current project.</s><s> bridge has great organizational capabilities, but only at the full clip/file level. 
</s><s>if i only shot perfect clips from end to end, only wanted to use those clips in single projects, or only had a small amount of footage in my library, i'd be fine as is. 
</s><s>but i don't....i shoot clips that always have extraneous garbage, i want to be able to use the best footage in a variety of projects, and i have way too much footage to keep it all organized in a single project without bogging things down.........and i don't think i'm alone :-) 
-catalogue of assets -smart collections -ingest only mode -batch ingest with subclipping (hopefully with soft edges) 
...</s><s>would all be awesome.</s><s> the added rough cut editing capabilities are great "nice to haves"...but since that can all be done in premiere, i'd have to label those as secondary to the organization and file prep necessities.

<s>i have to say that it is very confusing that there is this difference between metadata added during ingest and that added during logging.</s><s> they are both called metadata and it is taken me quite some time (and after having logged 12 days of footage) to realise there is a difference between the two.</s><s> i think if nothing else you should make this far clearer to users from the outset.</s><s> this post is the only reference i have been able to find which says there is a difference. - i really wish i had known this earlier! 
</s><s>it just seems so strange that i can add metadata during ingest and then after ingest it is shown to me in prelude in the metadata panel but that specific metadata is very much restricted - i can't add further fields to that set of metadata and i can add data to any fields i missed during the ingest. 
</s><s>its very hard to see why there is this difference between to the two and why they are kind of treated the same in the ui, which makes it confusing.</s><s> even more so because you can create a "new schema" which is effectly a set of custom metadata and this is visible everywhere - why isn't the ingest custom meta data just handled like this? 
</s><s>also when sending files to premiere, you say "all metadata added to your media in prelude is visible in premiere pro" which is true but the fact you can only see custom metadata in the clips metadata panel is at times useless (where as new schema metadata is visible in the project file list).</s><s> for instances.</s><s> i have 2000 video files, which when ingested where given custom meta data, seemed like the right thing to do - now in premiere there is no way for me to find a subset of those clips with a specific metadata value - unless i look through each one individually using theur clips metadata panel.</s><s> crazy!</s><s> 
</s><s>i think what is so frustrating is that prelude looks so great when demo'ed - when every video demo has 5 short videos clips, and a couple of sub clips and one rough cut.</s><s> but in the real world when a project has 100's or 1000's of videos files things don't seem to hold up so well.</s><s> no one from adobe seems to have shown how to handle this prelude / premiere workflow for proper larger projects - and unfortunately its far from obvious how adobe expect us to do this. 
</s><s>i'd be interested to hear the rational beind the custom ingest meta data and what the point of it is and why it is completely separate (kind of) from the "other" meta data?

<s>hi rob - 
</s><s>sorry - just realized i never really addressed your post... 
1.</s><s> confusion between metadata at ingest and during logging. 
</s><s>quite true.</s><s> metadata != metadata.</s><s> prelude allows you to create to general categories of metadata on your assets: static and temporal.</s><s> static metadata applies to the entire clip.</s><s> things like frame rate, title, keywords, etc...bascially things that do not change over time.</s><s> temporal metadata is time-based information - primarily 'markers' for prelude. 
</s><s>in our ingest panel you can create a basic form for custom metadata fields.</s><s> this is static metadata, but a special flavor.</s><s> we call this custom dynamic metadata schemas.</s><s> why do you give it such a fancy name?</s><s> mainly as an attempt to distinguish it from a standard metadata schema.</s><s> a "standard metadata schema" is a set of key-value like pairs which reside in a file on disk.</s><s> prelude and premiere ship with a number of these.</s><s> you can find these in the metadata panel in each application.</s><s> items like "dublin core" and "dynamic media" are examples of standard metadata schemas.</s><s> the fields and the types of values the fields can hold are defined inside a text file on your hard drive.</s><s> these schemas cannot change in format (the values can change, but not the items).</s><s> you can also create your own standard metadata schemas using either prelude or premiere pro.</s><s> you do this from the "metadata display" dialog which is launched from the metadata panel's flyout menu option "metadata display".</s><s> in that dialog you select the "new schema..." and away you go.</s><s> what you're creating here is a description file (schema) representing the elements you wish to track and store in xmp.</s><s> (hold on - we're almost there...</s><s>) 
</s><s>this standard metadata schema you just created requires the presence of the disk file in order to be understood and parsed in our apps.</s><s> in other words, you need to send that disk file to other computers you wish to use the same schema.</s><s> this can work, but of course you need to ensure you share the file and keep it in sync.</s><s> not a very dynamic workflow - but it is functional. 
</s><s>now then, with the custom dynamic metadata schema feature in prelude's ingest dialog, what you are creating is something that actually live inside the xmp metadata and is self describing.</s><s> in other words, you don't need to share any standard metadata schema file between computers.</s><s> all the details about the metadata are already in the xmp.</s><s> we think this is a much cleaner and smarter metadata workflow.</s><s> but here lies the rub...</s><s> premiere pro does not yet recognize and allow for searching of this dynamic metadata.</s><s> that is coming soon, but is indeed a hole in our workflow (sorry about that!</s><s>).</s><s> 
</s><s>and you also discovered another limitation in the dynamic schema feature set - it is only editable in the ingest dialog when you are ingesting assets.</s><s> in one way this makes sense (at least it did to us originally) because the original intent of the feature was to allow you to stamp all ingested media with a certain key set of metadata.</s><s> it wasn't scoped to allow for later manipulation.</s><s> however, we've since learned from our customers that this is indeed a desired feature... so we're looking into the best way to allow for editing of this data as well. 
</s><s>we continue to work on our entire metadata story and workflow across the apps.</s><s> there is still work to do.</s><s> the good news is that the right discussions and efforts are happening within the adobe hallways and offices to get us there.</s><s> as the pieces come together the workflow of having 1000's of assets you can effectively organize and search through regardless of which app you're working in will feel seamless. 
</s><s>please keep the feedback coming.</s><s> it really helps us focus on the most critical issues you face in the real world production workflow.

<s>i am an early adopter of prelude, and my biggest concern from the beginning is the discussion on this thread.</s><s> i jumped right in with adding tons of metadata - some from the existing templates and a bunch of custom metadata - and then i was completely disapponted when i sent it over to pr.</s><s> i said it once before that prelude can do a lot of talking, but premiere can't listen.</s><s> and therefore, the functionality of prelude is completely hobbled.</s><s> so many kudos to the prelude team for all of their work over the past few years, and i'm sure they are hoping that premiere can come along a little bit with search capabilities.

</s><s>then, that comes into prelude with the clips and becomes searchable for organization, rough cuts, and then sending clips over to premiere. 
</s><s>then finally in premiere, you can do boolean keyword searches, so if you need to find a clip of someone talking about "llamas" while laughing and wearing a red shirt...that clip (marker) comes up immediately.</s><s> the possibilites are endless here.</s><s> there is such a great promise to change how video/audio clips can be tagged, organized and accessed more quickly than any other editing platform - especially now with live logger - but the implementation is at a dead end for the moment.</s><s> (premiere, c'mon!</s><s>)

<s>hey michael, Ê thanks for detailed reply - i got a bit sidelined as i'm in the middle of a long shoot, but your explanation really helped and i think its great to now have this on record so others will hopefully find the information.</s><s> look forward to seeing the improvements that come out in prelude and premiere with regards to all this metadata workflow.

Ê i have been keeping a list of a few other prelude features/issues that would be great to see in the future: metadata support for subclips.</s><s> currently we can only add a name and description to a subclip but often i have a long single video clip with multiple sub clips and each could do with additional meta - the same schema i use again a whole clip.</s><s> allow subclips to be nested under there master clips in the project list.</s><s> an option to turn this on or off would be helpful.</s><s> or some other project panel ui that better handles clips & subclips.</s><s> allow us to show metadata columns in the project panel (like we can in premiere's project panel).</s><s> this would be really helpful.</s><s> after adding all this great metadata to your clips the ability to manage those clips based on the meta values is quite limited - really only search.</s><s> being allow to sort clips by metadata columns or quickly just view that data would be great.</s><s> auto complete for meta data fields - using values entered previously.</s><s> also would be great if there was a way to clear the auto complete memory in the preferences.</s><s> additional metadata field type - list - where you can definite specific values and they are presented as a drop down list when you enter the metadata.</s><s> its already present for some of the predefinited metadata values (like shot) and would be great if we could create these types ourselves.</s><s> horizontal scroll in any window/panel - sure this has to be getting fixed soon as its the same across several cc apps and its mind bendingly confusing.</s><s> horizontal scrolling doesn't match the os x "natural" movement but the vertical scrolling does!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s> as i said not just a prelude issue, common across all cc apps but drives me up the wall and maybe the prelude team can be the ones to get this bug sorted.

<subject>New features I'd like to see in Prelude</subject>
<post author="needles27" timestamp="May 20, 2012 9:39 AM">
<s>prelude is a very cool program and i can see this becoming a vital part of the workflow.</s><s> i have noticed a few things that aren't perfect yet and would like to change.</s><s> i will file feature requests, but i am wondering if anyone else agrees with these, has any workarounds, or has other items to add to the list. 
1. thumbnail view in the project window with hoverscrub.</s><s> pr took a giant leap forward with hoverscrub so you don't have to load each clip into the source monitor to preview, and pl could use this as well.</s><s> (the case could be made that pl needs this even more, since this will be a step in the workflow where you could be searching through clips even more than you would in the bins in pr) 
2. more efficient way to create bins and move clips in the project window.</s><s> right now, when you create a new bin, it shows up at the bottom of the list of clips.</s><s> i have a project open with 500 clips in it - if there is a clip at the top that i want to throw into the new bin, i have to drag it down and wait for the list to scroll all the way to the bottom - slowly!</s><s> such a big time waster.</s><s> it would be more useful if i could highlight a clip - or multiple clips - hit "new bin" and the clips would automaticaly be placed in the new bin.</s><s> or, having the option to have multiple tabs in the project window (like pr) could also alleviate the issue. 
3.</s><s> the ability to send clips to a specific bin in pr.</s><s> right now, when you send clips over to pr, they show up in the main project window.</s><s> if i have a bin structure set up there, it would be nice to target certain bins so the clips down't get lost in the higher level bin hierarchy.</s><s> for example, if i'm working in a bin that is nested in a b-roll bin, nested in an interview subject and want to go back to pl to find more clips, i would like the ability to have the b-roll bin open, go to pl, send a clip, and have it show up there in the proper bin.</s><s> now, i have to navigate back to the top level and drag it to the proper place.</s><s> not a huge deal with one clip, but working with lots of clips can get disorganzied pretty quickly.</s><s> one last note - some might say that all the pl work should be done up front and organized there before going tp pr, but i am finding pr-pl to work well together, using pl as my sorting, metadata and organization tool concurrent with pr.</s><s> essentially, pl is acting like a turbocharged version of pr's brower, poject panel and metadata panel in a separate app. 
</s><s>any thoughts?

<s>1. most definitely needs hover scrub in prelude, 
2. completely agree, the workflow should all be smooth and intuitive, not searching, hunting, dragging and waiting for lists to scroll down. 
3. again, completely agree, perhaps there is a way so that when you send to premiere there's a dialogue that comes up and would say "importing to premiere in _______" and a drop down list of a list of bins that are already in your premiere project, and ability to create a new bin with in the dialogue and would ask you where you want the clip(s) to go in. 
</s><s>my feature requests are being made. 
</s><s>other thought's so far that i've found. 
1.</s><s> need the ability to spot clips from bridge to prelude.</s><s> the "open with prelude" command doesn't ingest the clip (bug report sent) 2.</s><s> have prelude's searching of time based markers and comments in premiere (this is probably a premiere request, but it's relevant here) 3.</s><s> the markers created in prelude, or in premiere become a drop down list of markers in the project panel and have the ability to use each marker as a subclip, rather than having to create an actual subclip.</s><s> it'd be nice to not have to create hundreds of subclips.</s><s> example, i have one interview clip that is 30min long, there are 10 questions asked 3 times each, i now need to create 30 subclips to have "in and out" points to drop into my timeline.</s><s> with a drop down list of markers, or the ability to spot clips from the marker window, i could keep only one clip but have access to all 30 individual clips within the clip.</s><s> i completely understand premiere is not fcp7 but here is the example of the functionality i am thinking of.</s><s> each marker in the pull down can be loaded into the viewer(source in premiere) as its own referenced clip. 


</s><s>just my thoughts, i am very interested in hearing others approach to these workflow processes.

<s>thanks wes, 
</s><s>it's not quite what i'm in need of but is a great solution as a workaround, so thanks for pointing that out, and for what it does is really easy and convenient. 
i think this solution is good for one take situations, but would be cumbersome to keep organizing media as the rough cuts get sent over to premiere on larger projects.</s><s> i think the biggest issue is not having the option to choose where clips get sent to in premiere, it's a little cumbersome to go back and forth between the applications for this purpose, and have to keep organizing footage individually. 
</s><s>but in general having the ability to log clips with time based metadata is a great advantage.</s><s> i'll be working though workflow practices the more i keep using prelude. 
</s><s>is there a thumbnail view at all in prelude's project panel, seams like i'm missing a simple check box, but i'm only seeing lists.

<s>rbemendo, 
</s><s>thanks for adding to the list.</s><s> i totally agree with your ideas - and i will have to defer to you about the bridge requests since it is not something i use.</s><s> i really like the idea of having better access to the time-based markers.</s><s> i also edit long form interviews, and my old workflow (coming over from fcp) was to just drop it into a timeline and pull out subclips from there.</s><s> but having a quick access to multiple answers as a drop-down list would be killer!</s><s> seems like the more you can quickly do your clip searching, marking, tagging, etc in prelude and then having good access to that data in pr seamlessly would make for an insane workflow. 
</s><s>also, i think you might have addressed this in the pr forum, but as far as your concern for corrupting your original files while writing metadata to it: i have been toying with the ingest window and setting a secondary target while importing the footage.</s><s> this way, you have a backup that will remain untouched as you work with your metadata files.</s><s> (at least i am assuming it is untouched...can someone corect me if the files in the secondary location get the metadata from pl?</s><s>)

<s>glad you agree needles27, hopefully we can get some more people using and commenting on this workflow so we can get bumped up for feature requests. 
i just tested the ingest to a secondary target and writing the metadata and i can confirm that the data is only being written to that secondary location, i tested this by ingesting and transferring a clip to a secondary drive, added metadata, save and brought to pr.</s><s> then ingested the same original clip without copying it to a secondary target and there was no metadata in pl, pr, or bridge, so pl is only writing to the transferred file if that is the option you choose, otherwise it will write to the original file.</s><s> i think to keep things safe i'm going to just copy all my material to a secondary hardrive as back up and then use the files on my working raid as the metadata synced files, rather than only ingesting what i need.</s><s> i know ideal you'd only bring in material that you will use in the project, but when you have clients over your shoulder having all your media accessible is a must in most instances. 
</s><s>i'm working with dual sync sound and finding some interesting limitations with logging dual sync sound. 
1.</s><s> i'm not liking that there is no audio support in pl, nor a solution to sync/merge, and then transcode a merged clip, so that there is not an xml link to the dual sync audio, but a separate media file containing the original video and the dual sync audio. 
2.</s><s> when merging a clip in pr and adding markers to the merged clip master file, the markers do not update in the source of the merged clip, nor do they update in pl.</s><s> the only way to update markers on a merged clip with consistency is to update the source of the merged clip, and the updated metadata will retain in pr as well as the merged clip.</s><s> this has been mentioned before without much detail, hopefully this clarifies at least some of that. http://forums.adobe.com/message/4375489#4375489. 
3.</s><s> the ability to have the metadata panel part of the project panel would eliminate a lot of need to bin structure hundreds of clips.</s><s> example: batch keyword or add custom metadata in bridge, and then search and align that metadata in the project panel rather than having to create bins for everything to be organized.

<s>thanks michaelgoshey, prelude has great potential. 
</s><s>when ingesting, and choosing the transcode option, do we only have access to the presets provided by prelude?</s><s> i'm not seeing an option to go to prores from with in the quicktime presets or any other custom defined preset. 
</s><s>since the ability to have multiple transcode locations can accomplish alot of dailies requests from inside prelude, i think prelude could become a dailies hub, much like redcinex is for r3d. 
</s><s>to be a dailies application though you would need all customizable transcoding settings so we can custom design our own workflow for our needs.</s><s> as well as supporting audio, syncing and then transcoding to multiple locations with user defined and saved presets.</s><s> it would also be great to have the ability to apply luts from within prelude, not necessarily create luts, but be able to apply them from something like a import dialogue, or even better a browser window that allows you to double click on a lut in a folder designated for 100s of luts to help develop a look on set.</s><s> this option would be available in the logging and ingest work areas.</s><s> this way you can create true dailies for producers with a lut burned into an h.264 with sync sound as well as having no lut applied to a sync sound in one file transcoded to prores or dnxhd or whatever you need for editorial.

<s>as i mentioned a few weeks ago, and have mentioned with an adobe rep (iona walters in the uk) i would love to be able to see the ability to split stereo to mono tracks in prelude, or in premier, be able to split a stereo track to mono and update the sequence to represent this. 
i am currently a support technician in a university and work with media and performance students, who may never have edited before.</s><s> i see prelude as having amazing potential for getting the basic work done without any distractions like transitions etc and teaching the basic concepts behind in/out points etc. our cameras record two channel sound to a single stereo file though, and given the students won't really be concentrating on sound (a shame, audio post is what i do!</s><s>) it would be really handy to split the stereo files so they don't have to undo a rough cut in premier when they move over to it.</s><s> it seems a little backwards to have to create a rough cut, then totally undo it, just to split the audio.</s><s> not a problem of course when handing off to a proper audio editor, but in this circumstance, it would be really handy.</s><s> i wouldn't have thought it would be too difficult to implement, either?

<s>hi clctv - 
</s><s>thanks for the feature requests. 
</s><s>we have been discussing ways to provide what you described in #1 above.</s><s> an ingest queue would certainly prove useful. 
</s><s>renaming clips on ingest is also another popular request we are hearing from our users.</s><s> this is also a feature we have put in our backlog and are discussing internally. 
</s><s>in our discussions, we have identified the following three parts to renaming clips: 
renaming of simple files (.mov, .avi, etc) where there isn't a complex folder structure wrapping the essence.</s><s> this is a fairly straightforward workflow and easier to provide a solution for.</s><s> renaming media files contained within complex folder structures.</s><s> this is more difficult to deliver as it requires deep knowledge of the supporting metadata and xml files generated by the camera.</s><s> these supporting files also need to be updated to reflect the name changes or you can end up with broken files where the media can no longer be played.</s><s> the final part of the renaming of media you have selected to transcode as part of the ingest process in prelude.</s><s> in this case prelude could handle the renaming in a similar manner as #1 above for most format types. 
</s><s>for your final request, you mention you'd like to keep the timecode for all the clips used in the concatenation.</s><s> we too have been thinking of ways to make this a reality and would like to get your input on one of those ideas.</s><s> when you use multiple clips to concatenate into one, would you find it valuable to have prelude generate markers that span the duration of each of the original source clips?</s><s> this marker could contain things like original timecode, original clip name, metadata from the clip (which pieces are most desired here?</s><s>), etc. what other pieces of info would you hope to see there? 
</s><s>using the marker approach for preserving timecode seems to be the most compatible regarding playback (non-linear timecode in a single file can be confusing to some players - and people).</s><s> it is also one of the more feasible approaches we came up with that would limit potential bugs and other risks to the media.

<s>thank you michael for your response!</s><s> i'm glad to hear you guys are looking into these requests. 
</s><s>for your question, i'm not too familiar with using markers within prelude nor have i really used meta data, but from what i understand what you are saying that seems like a good option! 
</s><s>i'm just trying to find ways that i can incoorporate techniques i used with tape with the new digital file formats.</s><s> with tape, i could use batch capure based off of time code, working in the "station news" buisness basically the reporter will log video by just reviewing a 10-15 minutes worth of interviews, logging timcode for every "sound-bite." they they would write there script, inputing the timcode of the "sound bites" they wanted in different parts of the script.</s><s> i would then take the script with timecode and within premiere i would enter the timecode in the capture window and "log clip" then once i got all my clips logged i would batch capture.</s><s> then i would only have the video we were going to use stored on my computer.</s><s> with tape i could also capture multiple shots under one file name. 
</s><s>with digital clips it seems as though i have to load the entire clip onto my computer (taking up storage space) then extract files from there.</s><s> i would also end up with 5x as many clips because each star/stop of a shot comes in as a separate clip.</s><s> some formats the time doesn't even show up.</s><s> that's why i like were prelude is going.</s><s> i can easily view the clips before and ingest the parts i need.</s><s> i really like the concatenate feature.</s><s> for what i mentioned earlier on timecode, it would be nice if within the ingest window you can input timecode for the in & out of each clip or at the least be able to see the timecode as you srub.</s><s> this way i can easily use the method of timecode editing again.

<s>i've been using prelude a lot since the release of the cs6, and i love it.</s><s> the app is also incredibly promising for a v1. 
</s><s>my top 3 features would be : 
1- audio support in prelude. 
</s><s>including ingesting with or without transcode, splitting stereo or multi channel into mono files (and / or something like the modify clip / audio channels menu from pr), full logging, marking and metada support (as with video) and audio / video syncing and merging.</s><s> for me being unable to work with audio is actually the single biggest missing feature. 
2- keywords (subject) tagging built into prelude. 
</s><s>having to rely on bridge, a photo oriented application, for this task is at best clunky.</s><s> and bridge does not play really well with video (on my workstations at least).</s><s> being able to build hierarchical keyword collections and use them to tag and filter files right into prelude would greatly smooth and speed up things for the workflows that rely on them. 
3- being able to create multiclip in prelude. 
i think this might be a lot harder and maybe not even possible but the ability to create multiclip into prelude so that the editor would have them ready inside the pr project would be another step into making prelude the "one stop shop for assistant". 
i already made feature requests for 1 and 2, i'll make one for 3 as soon as possible. 
i hope that the development team for prelude also have some weight into premiere development, as you guys seem to have a lot of good clues at how media management should be done, and this is still by far (imho) premiere most serious weakness.

<s>thank you michael,

<s>hi adrian - 
</s><s>ok Ð i understand now.</s><s> thanks for the extra info there. 
</s><s>we have spent time getting thumbnails to load faster in our ingest dialog in prelude 2.01 and now again in 2.1.</s><s> can you verify for me which version you are using and also which media format you are using (xdcam, p2, red, etc) - and what media type (optical disk, memory card, etc.</s><s>).</s><s> this will help us try to recreate your results in our lab. 
</s><s>we are looking at the option to show you which clips have already been ingested into the current project.</s><s> ideally we'd like to let you know which clips have already been ingested into any project Ð but this requires a database in our backend system that we don't have available yet (and is a bigger effort).</s><s> the first pass here will at least help with letting you solve the ingesting into the same project workflow issue you are describing.</s><s> i can't say when this will be available but it is quite high on our priority list. 
</s><s>the idea of a batch ingest operation is also something we are still looking at.</s><s> as a possible alternative, we are also looking at moving the ingest dialog into the main app as another panel instead of a dialog.</s><s> this would also resolve the issues you are describing as it would allow you to select a group of clips in the panel and ingest them in the background while then selected a different set of clips (with different options/transcode rules as desired) and fire that off into the background processing thread as well.</s><s> i'd be interested to hear your thoughts about that model as well as the option of adding a batch ingest window into the current ingest dialog.</s><s> which would you prefer and find more useful?

<s>hi sheree - 
</s><s>the workflow you are describing should work as you expect.</s><s> i don't see anything that stands out as an obvious problem there. 
</s><s>one question though - you mention that you drag the rough cut from the premiere pro project panel into the timeline.</s><s> at that point the rough cut is actually a sequence (as soon as premiere loads the rough cut it becomes a regular sequence in the pr world).</s><s> when you drag it into a timeline it is then a nested sequence.</s><s> i am surprised to hear that when you delete that nested sequence from the timeline it also deletes the project panel reference to it.</s><s> i would suggest posting this scenario on the premiere pro forum as well and see if there is any known issue with that workflow.</s><s> i've tried it here and am unable to reproduce the problem. 
</s><s>if you create sequences in pr, do they also behave the same way the rough cut sequences behave? 
</s><s>the xmp id will have no impact on the rough cut workflow you are describing.</s><s> the xmp id is just a quick tag adobe video products put into assets - it is a unique identifier that isn't used except for some relinking workflows. 
</s><s>don't give up.</s><s> you didn't waste your time building rough cuts.</s><s> the workflow you want is what has been developed and implemented.</s><s> let's see what the pr team can add into the mix here.

<s>hey michael, 
</s><s>thanks for getting back to me so soon sorry, i have to give you links to imgur for pictures of my desktop.</s><s> i tried everything people suggested, but i still cannot get the insert link or insert photo on the forum to work, ugh! 
</s><s>the problem i was having yesterday is that the rough cut sequence file remains in the premiere pro project panel after deleting it from the timeline, but does not contain anything once it is deleted from the timeline, the thumbnail becomes blank/black and the rough cut footage cannot be brought back into the same or a different timeline without going back to prelude and resending the rough cut and associated footage to premiere.</s><s> i was getting "no content in sequence in/out range". 
http://i.imgur.com/74ubhvi.jpg 
however, this morning i start up my computer, reopen prelude and start premiere project from scratch.</s><s> then i sent the same rough cut as yesterday to premiere.</s><s> this time when i drag the rough cut to the timeline premiere makes a new duplicate sequence.</s><s> that did not happen yesterday.</s><s> i have no idea why as all settings are identical. 
http://imgur.com/l0kirvb *note i put the additional sequence on the timeline cause i wanted to see if it was identical. 
</s><s>so, my next step was to delete the rough cut from the timeline and bring it back into the timeline.</s><s> i get the same message "no content in sequence in/out range". 
</s><s>then i repeated everything again, only this time if i double click the rough cut to bring it into the timeline instead of dragging it.</s><s> it does not make a duplicate sequence. 
http://i.imgur.com/ylfvq2h.jpg 
then i delete the rough cut in the timeline and try to bring it back in to the timeline and get the "no content in sequence in/out range" message.</s><s> so in order to have access to that rough cut again i have to go back to prelude and have it send the roughcut and associated footage back into premiere. 
http://i.imgur.com/iq9ozdy.jpg 
all the footage used in the rough cut sent over to premiere from prelude is still accessible in the project panel after deleting the rough cut from the timeline.</s><s> it is the rough cut itself that is no longer available once it is ingested into the timeline and then deleted. 
</s><s>my real concern in working with my rough cuts from prelude is the stability of the rough cut.</s><s> once i start working within the roughcut footage and i decide to add, edit or delete clips am i going to have issues.</s><s> if i have to start going back to prelude to resend rough cuts then this will be a huge issue and it would just be better for me to start with my original footage as opposed to the rough cuts. 
i hope this gives you a better understanding of the problem.</s><s> if you need any more info or if you need to do remote access to my system please let me know.</s><s> thanks again!

<s>hi, 
</s><s>thank you for your post.

<s>hi jenny. 
</s><s>ok my post wasn't maybe that clear, i was talking about the unique identifier that is supposedly written in the basic > identifier metadata field when you import files in prelude, media encoder or premiere pro with this option enabled : 





</s><s>for clips imported through specific view mode, it works just fine and they get a long random string of characters generated and written on the identifier field.</s><s> for files imported through the basic file directory view, it does not seems to work and the basic > identifier field ends up empty.</s><s> amongst other things, having this xmp id avoid cache file conflict for files that do have the same file name.</s><s> and as we work on multiple project at the same time on a networked storage, we do end up sometimes with different files having the same name used concurrently.</s><s> no problem when they have the xmp id, but when they do not cache related stuff tends to be acting weird (like rebuilding and piling up new .pek peak files over and over every time the project is opened, we can end up with thousands of them). 
</s><s>the fast and easy way to avoid this is renaming everything we're going to import through file directory view but i'd prefer being able to benefit from the automated xmp id generation.

<s>hi michael. 
</s><s>thank for your interest.</s><s> i guess i went even more unclear than i was in my first post. 
</s><s>my initial issue was that some .pek files were continuously getting new versions of them written (with a "-1" appended to their file name) every time the projects containing their related video files were opened.</s><s> it looks like premiere keep "forgeting" were the .pek fils are and generate new one each time.</s><s> i have checked "save media cache files next to originals when possible" so those .pek files are with their associated files, not in the common cache folder.</s><s> i noticed that it happened on files sharing the same file names and that renaming the troublemakers solved the issue.</s><s> those were almost all transcoded .mov qt prores files originating from gopros. 
</s><s>while looking into this issue i noticed that files originating from panasonic af-101 did not have the issue while having similar names too (00000.mov, 00001.mov and so on).</s><s> i saw in prelude that they had their basic > identifier xmp field filled up while the files coming from gopro and canon dslr did not, so i jumped to conclusions about xmp id not being correctly writtent onto those and this being the cause of the issue.</s><s> i was wrong, the xmp id is correctly written on every files. 
i then turned myself to the .ims and .mcdb files to see if i could spot something odd that could explain the issue, but as i don't know much about the way they work, i was only able to find what is shown in my two screengrabs : .ims files related to transcoded .mov qt prores (99% of the video files we work with at the moment) seems empty compared to .ims related to the very same file ingested or transcoded in another way. 
</s><s>i'm hopefully not trying to use the premiere cache files to do anything metada related (and i don't miss anything with xmp, i even wish that it could become a standard for metadata interchange), but i really do like and want to understand how things work under the hood.
