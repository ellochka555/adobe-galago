<s>i think the official process to go back to the previous non-beta acr would be to uninstall ps-cc and any other adobe app that uses acr, then reinstall those and reupdate them to the current acr version using the updates process from within the apps. 
</s><s>you could try installing acr 8.3 from one of the direct links on this page, but i don't know if it'll let you downgrade versions that way: http://blogs.adobe.com/crawlspace/2011/03/keeping-photoshop-up-to-date .html#notconnected 
if you can find the camera raw.plugin file on your computer associated wtih ps-cc then there might also be a way to extract and rename the large resource file from the dmg at the above link and copy it over the top of your current camera raw plug-in file.</s><s> i have done this on a pc but don't know what the specific file names and paths are on a mac to be more specific.

<subject>Does ACR include all information from X-Trans sensors?</subject>
<post author="ark@acm.org" timestamp="Mar 6, 2014 8:51 AM">
<s>there has been a lot of discussion about how best to convert information from x-trans sensors.</s><s> early conversion algorithms have been criticized in various fora and the algorithms have been improved.</s><s> therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the algorithms will be improved again in the future. 
</s><s>if i store a raw file and then convert it to another form, say, tiff, using a future conversion algorithm, i will obviously be able to take advantage of that algorithm.</s><s> what if i store it in dng form today and then convert it to tiff in the future?</s><s> will i be able to use the future conversion algorithm, or will key information have been lost in converting to dng? 
</s><s>here's what i think the situation is: 
if i use dng converter 8.4 and say that i want conversion that is compatible with acr 7.1, then the x-trans information is preserved.</s><s> moreover, converting to dng does lossless compression, so the dng file that results is likely to be smaller than the original raw file. 
</s><s>if i use dng converter 8.4 and say that i want conversion that is compatible with acr 6.3 or earlier, then dng converter will do the conversion to rgb pixels.</s><s> this will result in a dng file that will probably be larger than the original raw file, and will make it impossible to use future raw conversion algorithms.</s><s> however, it will also yield a dng file that can be opened by versions of photoshop before cs6 and versions of lightroom before lr5. 
i would really appreciate it if someone from adobe can tell me whether my understanding is correct, and correct it if it is not.

<subject>Does ACR include all information from X-Trans sensors?</subject>
<post author="ssprengel" timestamp="Mar 6, 2014 9:13 AM">
<s>your understanding is generally correct. 
</s><s>at some point in the acr 7.x series, maybe 7.2 or 7.3, adobe updated their x-trans demosaicking/interpolation algorithms in the camera raw engine used in acr plug-in, dngc, and lr, to produce a higher quality result. 
</s><s>the newer dng converters do not need to interpolate the data for newer acr plug-in versions. 
</s><s>the newer dng converters do interpolate the data for older acr plug-ins and older lrs using the better algorithms so those older products have the better interpolation results to work with. 
</s><s>older dng converters do a bad job of interpolating the data for even older acr plug-ins and lr versions and this poor quality cannot be improved even if a new acr plug-in or lr version is used because the damage done by the poor interpolation algorithms is already baked in. 
</s><s>another thing you might see is if you convert the data using a newer dng converter and dng 7.1 compatibility options, but mistakenly process this dng with an older acr plug-in or older lr version, then you'll see holes in the data, because the older cr engine is expecting interpolated data and the newer dnc conversion options aren't interpolating, anymore.

i believe that adobe is now making a stronger statement, namely that starting with acr 8.4, the demosaicing/linearization is done *after* conversion to dng by default (i.e. unless you request compatibility with acr 7.1 or earlier), and that the dng file records the original pixel information from the x-trans sensor.

<s>hello alper tonga, Ê let me begin with a recommendation: please read papers diagonally, where sabine ssstrunk is author or co-author.</s><s> this guarantees excellent quality.</s><s> for instance this one: http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/182538/files/egpaper_final.pdf Ê if we refer to a certain document, i might be able to explain this and that.</s><s> please ask here. Ê the issue cannot be summarized in a few sentences, but trying this isn't wasted time: Ê an input device, camera or scanner, contains three types of color sensors, one for r, one for g and one for b. each sensitivity function (versus wavelength) looks like a narrow gaussian bell.</s><s> these shapes may overlap or not.</s><s> probably this sounds very reasonable Ð and it is, for instance, if we had to reproduce once and for ever offset prints.</s><s> this 'densitometric device' could be calibrated by test images for this application. Ê for real world photos this doesn't work.</s><s> the scene shows colors which can be uniquely described by cie xyz.</s><s> the camera should be able to reproduce these colors in xyz.</s><s> the only accurate solution to this problem was discovered by luther, the luther condition: original: http://docs-hoffmann.de/luther1927.pdf translation into english: http://www.google.de/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja& ved=0cduqfjab&url=http%3a%2f%2fiscc.org%2fpdf%2fluthercolorstimmetrics .pdf&ei=y5yvu7ryiqq8ygo73ykica&usg=afqjcnhgvmof2mywfbsy-zxcovnf33eola& bvm=bv.62286460,d.bgq the luther condition: the three sensitivity functions have to be the cie color matching functions (cmfs), or linear combinations of those.</s><s> x-bar, y-bar and z-bar are all positive, thus they can be used for sensors, but it turned out, that this choice leads to severe inaccuracies (the sensor covers the whole horseshoe diagram area, the x-bar and y-bar curves are widely overlapping and the transformation into common rgb-spaces suffers from noise).</s><s> linear combinations have mostly negative lobes.</s><s> as a compromise, these are clipped and the remaining behaviour isn't exactly colorimetric, but altogether not bad.</s><s> in any case it's nearer to the luther ideaÊ than the densitometric solution.</s><s> therefore it's possible to solve this mentioned equation x = c r for c and extract the three columns as approximations for the primaries in xyz, or, how i would say now, calculate the three pseudoprimaries. Ê just this is explained in the article by sabine ssstrunk. Ê Ê best regards --gernot hoffmann

<s>i would like to confirm your opinion Ð you're right. 
</s><s>if the spectral sensitivities are linear combinations of the cmfs, then the conversion matrix is the exact solution, as you said.</s><s> but this matrix contains 9 unknowns, which are not correlated.</s><s> therefore one needs at least 9 patches.

</s><s>i would like to ask a specific question about the camera calibration tab, found in lr and acr and also found in dng profile editor.

<s>you've installed the adobe camera raw 8.4 plug-in for photoshop.
