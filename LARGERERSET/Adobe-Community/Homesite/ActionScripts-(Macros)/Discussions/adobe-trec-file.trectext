<s>this may be too obvious for most people but i'm stumped.</s><s> why can't i add a third party cgi script to my website? 
</s><s>it's a simple enough site search script, csscript.</s><s> on my website, local side, i created a directory in dreamweaver mx called cgi-bin.</s><s> next, in windows i copied all files and subdirectories into the cgi-bin directory.</s><s> when i look for the files in dreamweaver, they're missing.</s><s> they're not part of the website, and no one is going to make dreamweaver recognize that they're part of the site, no way. 
</s><s>so, there's no visible way, no way that i can see, to add the script files to my website.</s><s> nor does there appear to be any help anywhere on the internet.</s><s> if the problem is too simple to see, aren't the next 100 people going to make exactly the same mistake?

<s>i may have a partial answer myself.</s><s> i recently tried disabling a number of startup items because something eats up time and memory and i wanted my machine to run faster.</s><s> if i disabled an adobe program that checks for consistency between the windows directories and adobe dreamweaver's idea of a directory, that may cause the issue.

<s>more news: i have just touched up all copies of a .jpg image with a couple of blue pixels, courtesy of mspaint.</s><s> when i preview the image in dreamweaver the image is unchanged.</s><s> this trick isn't easy for a computer to do.</s><s> somehow the image has to be cached someplace.
