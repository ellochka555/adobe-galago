<s>in my quest to find a replacement for my beloved homesite, i came across an app several months ago that others may find helpful.</s><s> i have tried dozens of programs and none have remained installed on my pc for longer than a week.</s><s> it is freeware.</s><s> it is highly customizable and supports custom highlighters, menus, macros, wizards, extensiolns, etc. it can compile code in just about every environment.</s><s> the application is called ps pad.</s><s> have any of the hs gurus tried ps pad (http://www.pspad.com/en/)? 
(copy+paste from site) pspad is a freeware programmer's editor for microsoft windows operating systems, useful for people who: work with various programming environments like highlighted syntax in their source code need a small tool with simple controls and the capabilities of a mighty code editor are looking for a tool that handles plain text want to save time - pspad offers rich text formating functions need tool what offer user extension capabilities want to save money and still have the functionality of professional products because pspad is free for commercial and government purposes too (end copy+paste) 
</s><s>the creator lives in the cvech republic, and speaks very little english.</s><s> as a result, the application and help files are poorly translated to english but as far as i can tell, the application is pretty solid for someone who wants homesite's flexibility & the ability to write code under your own terms.</s><s> unfortunately, i can't work with dreamweaver.</s><s> i have tried to code with it many times over the years and always end up with broken code when i rely on it.</s><s> i find the application overly bloated, unnessarily complex, and incredibly frustrating as it simply won't stop changing my code. 
i hope more english speakers get involved with the project as i believe it has a lot to offer to coders worldwide, but it's exposure is currently limited for a variety of reasons.</s><s> i admit that i have found the application a bit difficult to use because the terminology (poor translation) can be confusing.</s><s> it really needs a person like jeff wilkinson to expose its true power.</s><s> i know i would have never figured out custom parsers or vtml without jeff wilkinson's contribution to the hs community. 
</s><s>if anything, i hope someone finds the app useful.</s><s> i am actively using it but i do find myself relying on hs as well because old habits are hard to break and i don't fully understand how to work with ps pad yet.

<s>it does support firefox (not by default b/c it requires another install for the support), as well as other browsers externally.</s><s> there is a major language barrier with the developer.</s><s> the application is more flexible than it appears.</s><s> i'm still trying to figure it out and am by no means, an advanced user, but as each day passes, i am more impressed and a bit more comfortable with it.</s><s> honestly, i am also beginning to think it's better than homesite.</s><s> as a major plus, it has an active, growing community of contributors and a developer who cares about the product.</s><s> i just wish there were more english speakers involved.</s><s> i have had a lot of difficulty understanding the translated documentation & help files. 
</s><s>reading the forum, it's compiled with a delphi wrapper.</s><s> i'm not familiar with delphi, so i can't really comment on that part. 
</s><s>you may want to check out the extension scripts on multi-line search.</s><s> it might be possible.</s><s> if it's not available from their site (http://www.pspad.com/en/pspad-extensions.php) or via their forum, then there are also other sites that offer extensions for ps pad, as well.</s><s> actually, this sounds similar: http://www.phdesign.com.au/general/phreplace-goes-open-source/#more-19 3.</s><s> here's the original class architecture, http://www.phdesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/phreplace-archit ecture.pdf.</s><s> you can download it from their direcotry (first link) or the source code from https://www.assembla.com/spaces/phreplace/documents.</s><s> there are a couple other extensions that might work as well.</s><s> thinking about it, hs multi-line/multi-file search using expressions is an awesome feature that i haven't seen elsewhere.</s><s> perhaps, that's what you were referring to..</s><s> i guess i'm just trying to think positive and convince myself that this is a solid replacement that could potentially replace all of homesite's features with the right supporters behind it. 
</s><s>it's not a perfect solution for every hs user and it does have cons, like any app.</s><s> however, unlike hs, it is actively supported & updated by the developer.</s><s> it has an active community developing extensions.</s><s> it is very similar, if not better than, homesite in many ways but it will take time to setup for your personal needs.</s><s> for me, it has almost everything i love about homesite.</s><s> it may actually have everything ... the more i use it, the more it makes sense.</s><s> once i got a grip on their unique terminology, like "highligthers" and their use of "highlighters" & multi-highlighters for custom tag libraries, external help files, default syntax, etc., as well as the menu layout (probably makes more sense to europeans in the dev's native language), everything started to make sense.</s><s> i have since tweaked the menu to my liking but getting to this point wasn't straightforward, at all.</s><s> it takes some patience to figure out. 
</s><s>although still beta, there's a nice html 5 syntax extension with template, as well.</s><s> it also supports topstyle lite 3.0.</s><s> unfortunately, it's not compatiable with topstyle 3.5 but homesite isn't compatiable with new versions of topstyle either. 
</s><s>other than topstyle (doesn't even come close to hs in fuctionality & features) and simple notepad-like apps, what exists for windows?</s><s> if anyone knows of another program that's similar to hs, please do post it.</s><s> i've been searching for a replacement for a few years now.</s><s> i've tried everything from expensive bloated apps to shareware to open-source desktop apps to online editors.</s><s> ps pad is the best & only application i've found, so far, to replace hs.

<s>jeff, your comments are on the mark, at least for the problems i was experiencing with the quickbar not working in vista, in an installation in which i am the sole user/adminstrator.</s><s> "account user control" seems to be the key, at least in my case.</s><s> after seeing your post, i deconstructed what i had done originally: after installing vista, i installed homesite 5.5 while the vista user account control was still turned *on.* when i looked at the quickbar.dat file, as you suggested, i discovered it was empty.</s><s> adding back in the toolbar.tbr names to the quickbar.dat file made no difference.</s><s> so i did this: 1.</s><s> i uninstalled homesite.</s><s> 2.</s><s> i turned user account control *off* (go to control panel > user accounts > user accounts > turn user account control on or off).</s><s> 3. reinstalled homesite.</s><s> now everything is working correctly and the quickbar and other toolbars display and are functional, including right-clicking on the toolbar area to select/check which toolbar options should display.</s><s> because i am the sole vista user/admistrator, there are not ongoing security concerns.</s><s> but to test it, i turned account user control back *on* and rebooted to reset system security, and everything in homesite appears to still be working fine.</s><s> thanks for the help.
