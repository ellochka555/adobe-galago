<s>when the time past and adobe bought the macromedia (18 april 2005) there was a couple of major questions about macromedia's products futures in adobe's hands.</s><s> what did just happen since that time was actually very satisfying as all of them became more stronger day by day.</s><s> adobe introduced many other new features which are very useful for every of us who do use those software's for different reasons.</s><s> adobe incontext editing was one of the greatest feature which came with the dreamweaver and let web developers create "editable regions" in their home pages to edit those areas via regular major web browsers.</s><s> there is no charge for the moment for adobe incontext editing service.</s><s> but; there is a big question for people who do currently use adobe incontext editing in their web pages.</s><s> the question is " will adobe charge people for incontext editing?" answer is very important for many of those users who did integrated incontext in their sites as they use it free for the moment.</s><s> here is an official answer from adobe ---- how much does incontext editing cost?</s><s> while in free preview, incontext editing is available at no charge.</s><s> the final pricing for the service has not been determined; however, it will be offered as a monthly or annual subscription with a price of us$10 to us$20 per month.</s><s> use of the service will likely be limited to five domains, and users will be able to add domains for an additional fee.</s><s> the service may be bundled with other value-added services for web professionals.</s><s> it is up to web professionals how they charge their clients for the service. --- yeah us$10 or us20$, which will become us$120 or us$240 a year for limited domains (maybe 3 domains) and additional fee for more.</s><s> so do you think this charging is fair?</s><s> do you think you can make ur clients pay that money?</s><s> do you think dreamweaver should have build in paid features?</s><s> do you think you are going to buy it?</s><s> do you think cushycms (which makes the same job for free) can not handle the same thing for you?</s><s> do you think you are going to buy dw for us$699 and pay more for incontext or should be incontext for always free as adobe will not host nothing for us expect of ftp connection information and a couple of line connection reports?</s><s> please let us about your honest opinion...</s><s> the same inquiry is posted on http://adobeincontext.blogspot.com/ too.</s><s> thank you all who do share their own opinions on this topic...

<s>this is really driving me mad.</s><s> i would develop simple sites for my clients and they nearly always ask for a content management facility.</s><s> so i have been implementing different systems over the years depending on their requirements.</s><s> when incontext came out i thought that this was just fantastic.</s><s> it was an easy to setup and easy to use system.</s><s> changes are made from within the actual browser and not some form that looks a million miles from what the page looks like.</s><s> and of course it bypasses the upload of scripts to the hosting server that never work first time round and take days to get working correctly.</s><s> the only reason i bought dreamweaver cs4 was because of incontext.</s><s> the online videos and literature from adobe convinced me to buy this new version.</s><s> otherwise cs3 would have done just fine for the foreseeable future.</s><s> i have been working on existing sites and have priced for new work based on the incontext addition to dreamweaver.</s><s> by chance at the weekend i found out that this service will eventually have a monthly charge that has yet to be determined.</s><s> so i now have to remove the incontext work that i have already done and re-price the work that i am going for, which will probably mean that i will loose it.</s><s> all the work that i have done so far with incontext are on websites that i do not host.</s><s> it is once off work.</s><s> so if there is an ongoing fee that i must pay and i cannot re-coup it, then this means that i cannot use incontext.</s><s> to be honest with you most of the sites that i would be using it for would contain a small amount of content that would only need to be updated every couple of months, like a newsletter section.</s><s> so the advertised new feature of dreamweaver cs4 ends up to be an extra that will cost hundreds of dollars every year into infinity.</s><s> this has to be the biggest mistake adobe have ever made.</s><s> this is only going to turn people away from adobe products and lead them to find other companies that will provide the same product/service but give it as an included service with their software.</s><s> let's face it dreamweaver is not cheap and adobe doing this is just going to drive a wedge between adobe and its ever shrinking loyal clientele.

<s>^^^ i think that about sums it up. ^^^^

<s>here are my thoughts regarding whether incontext editing will be a worthy investment for me and my client.</s><s> i currently have only one client who could benefit from incontext.</s><s> the annual maintenance charge to my client potentially eliminated by incontext is about $300. 
</s><s>assuming a $20/month fee ($240 per year) for incontext passed on to my client, my client would normally save $60 per year.</s><s> but if i take into account the one-time labor cost of $150 for converting the site to incontext, my client actually would end up losing $90 the first year!</s><s> i couldn't recommend the service to my client at $20/month. in fact, if the fee turns out to be $20/month, i not only would have to reject adobe's service, but also probably charge my client to dismantle the incontext-enabled pages.</s><s> the client loses twice! 
</s><s>assuming a $10/month fee ($120 per year), the client potentially saves $30 the first year, and $180 during subsequent years.</s><s> i consider this a minimally-acceptable savings. 
i realize that if i had more clients i could spread the adobe fee around but, in my current situation, i would not be able to pay a subscription fee higher than $10/month.</s><s> a fee of $5/month would be more reasonable. 
i imagine that most of our clients are small businesses who, in these economically-challenging times, are looking for every opportunity to save money.</s><s> i am not skilled in php, databases, or other content management tools, so i can't realistically market my services to new clients unless i can offer some rudimentary content management such as that provided by incontext editing.</s><s> (but i don't wish to eat the cost of a high incontext subscription while i look for more clients.</s><s>) others have mentioned joomla, etc., as economical alternatives.</s><s> adobe should consider these factors when it decides on its fee structure.

<s>hello cristinel, 
</s><s>thanks a lot for your feed-back.</s><s> regarding costs, i think our customers are willing to pay more for a cms site than for a regular site, but if they choose to do the updates themselves, it is precisely to get rid of a recurring charge and avoid any kind of dependency towards a webmaster.</s><s> that's why i think that having a webmaster charge them recurringly is precisely what everybody wants to avoid. 
</s><s>besides, invoicing small amounts recurringly is certainly not what adobe wants to get into.</s><s> international recurring billing of small amounts is a hassle, and adobe is not a telecom company.it is also an exposure to bad debts for both webmasters and adobe. 
</s><s>to summarise, recurring billing is: 1. precisely what our customers want to avoid with cms 2. exposing webmasters to bad debts 3. not a good financial move for adobe 
so please, don't go into this. 
i truly think that incontext should be a option included in dreamweaver, but giving stuff away for free is not what adobe normally does, we all know that. 
i would agree to pay a one-time fee per domain, but anything above 50$ per domain would be totally unreasonable.</s><s> sara

<s>wow !</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s> huge attention to discussion i am very glad to see a great number of people did follow this discussion in very short time since we have posted it; also very nice to see adobe also paid attention to our personal comments here about pricing the "adobe incontext editing" and the way they did commercialize it on their videos and presentations on adobe's home page.</s><s> i read it all very carefully and see some very good explanations regarding the subject .</s><s> thank you all for your time but to be honest i didn't know people will pay so much attention to my post.   i have very little left to say after viewing the discussion and have come to the conclusion that this will probably be a never ending issue.  pricing an adobe product is not an everyday activity, so i think what "cristinel" did was very kind as the company he work for is currently rules the visual marketing for the planet we live on... .  i or any one of us who use adobe products should have no right to price the product as we have nothing to do with adobe except for personal or work purposes.</s><s> adobe price and develop it all very well since they started.</s><s> i wanna go with my very own personal clarification after the discussion is not my own any more...</s><s> i paid the asking price as i believe it deserves every penny i have invested into adobe dreamweaver; but in all honesty i will no longer take part of and will distance myself if i am made to pay a monthly fee for an additional dw feature and will not integrate it into my work place environment.</s><s> in addition, i am sadden by the fact that consumers are lead to believe 'incontext' is included as a new feature of dw cs4.</s><s> from now i can not take myself to be carefully with adobe words and products...   in a position in which adobe employees are unsure of, i will not further stress myself with an unknown future.</s><s> a small concern in relation to the "service fee." stated in your summary of concerns(regarding cristinel's post from adobe) it points out that "although advertised as a dreamweaver cs4 feature, it is not clear enough that the editing service will be paid." however under planned service price, it mentions that "what's for sure, it will not be free."   nonetheless, i feel exceptionally lucky and am grateful that adobe did not ask for a monthly fee for the included ftp and server side features.  best of luck to all those who will continue to use adobe incontext.     best regards [s]up

<s>i have three concerns about incontext, cost, stability, product availability. 
</s><s>first, the proposed charge of $120 - $240 annually is only for 5 web sites.</s><s> i have not seen anything regarding how much will be charged for additional sites.</s><s> i have about 40 sites where i think incontext would be worthwhile for clients posting emergency notices.</s><s> i would assume the incremental cost over the basic five sites would be less than the basic charge, but adobe has given no indication other than there will be a per site charge after the basic 5 sites.</s><s> will there be a limit to the number of sites that we can enroll?</s><s> i don't want to start something and then discover i cannot add additional clients because the live product offering has un upper limit to the number of sites or the incremental pricing is too high. 
</s><s>second, is that the production code be stable and avoid problems such as locking people out if a browser is updated.</s><s> today, i had to have a client using firefox clear out his cookies file so he could edit a page after he logged in but i consider those type of problems part of the beta.. 
</s><s>third, it is important to be able to give us a definitive target date for going live.</s><s> we cannot make any plans or decisions regarding whether we will actually use the product if it does not have a release date.</s><s> it forces us to look for alternatives.</s><s> i do understand the concept of beta tests and have been on both sides of the fence numerous times.</s><s> my concern is that an open-ended beta test (the way it appears now) is often times a product the never reaches actual production status. 
</s><s>finally, i believe the concept of a one-time fixed initial licence charge is a great idea.</s><s> personally, i happen to be a fan of adobe products and have used their products for years, but have also found other products where adobe fell short of our needs.</s><s> hopefully, this will not be one of those times.

<s>like a lot of other people, i have been getting increasinglingly frustrated and alarmed at adobe's aggressive upgrading policy and so when i saw that they were offering incontext with cs4 i thought - ah, they are giving us something back for the thousands of pounds we have spent on their products.</s><s> when i discovered they were going to charge for it, it felt shabby.</s><s> i have a reseller account with a company (tso host) that provides my customers with cpanel, which has better web page editing facilities, for free, than incontext.</s><s> why on earth should i or my customers pay?</s><s> also there is a resistance to monthly charges which a one off fee does not attract.</s><s> that is why dw extension companies like webassist do so well - pay once and use it for ever as many times as you like.</s><s> ok, i realise server time is involved here, but that psychological barrier is still there.</s><s> and why pay for someone else's server time when you are already running a server for your clients?</s><s> contribute makes more sense.</s><s> including incontext on the splash screen of dw cs4 without making it clear it will have to be paid for eventually is barrow-boy stuff and not what you expect from a company that, lets face it, makes superb software.</s><s> dw have dropped a clanger here and i hope they have the sense to either withdraw it or make it free.

<s>i must share the disbelief of many people who posted here before me.

</s><s>i'm just glad i stumbled upon this post before i connected any of my clients to this feature.

<s>i agree.</s><s> i'm not letting adobe off the hook or anything.</s><s> this needs to be finalized with upmost priority.</s><s> its just that it sounds like some have clients beating down their doors for a quote on such a service.</s><s> they are complaining that they need answers from adobe asap in order to secure the clients.</s><s> if that's the case then go with what you know.</s><s> aim high and get the contracts.</s><s> don't jeopardize your business because of adobe.</s><s> it just seems to that if you need answers yesterday in order to get business that's in the wings, then you have enough information to make a reasonable estimate.</s><s> if you can wait, then don't offer the service until you get more information.</s><s> if someone needs to give a client a quote now, then do it based on what they know and stop complaining to corey.</s><s> i have no doubt there are some brilliant designer/developers posting here, but we need to be equally smart business people as well.

<s>exactly right!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s> incontext is not the product.</s><s> the product is your service.</s><s> in context is a service you would provide to enhance and help market your service.</s><s> in fact, if offering incontext, or a similar service, helps you land business, then just breaking even or taking a small loss is worth it in the long run.</s><s> if you land $5,000 in contracts in a year because of the service and have to pay $240 out of pocket to offer it that year, then i would say it's well worth it.

<s>corey, i'm a little late finding this forum.</s><s> 1. adobe have sold this cs4 on the back of a helpful webmaster benefit (ice), but have failed to communicate in their literature that the service is provided at an additional cost, or publishing the pricing up front so prospective cs4 buyers can make a decision on the value of buying the product.</s><s> they are laying themselves open to some mis-selling accusations and can expect demands for refunds by recent buyers.</s><s> 2. when asked, they have failed to elaborate on the pricing policy or detail or timing of its implementation 3. the range of pricing being planned as appropriate is said to be between $120 and $240 for up to 5 domains.</s><s> this translates to a revenue to adobe of at least $120 and up to $240 with additonal revenue for extra domains.</s><s> nice earner if you can get it and potentially more than the total charged for buying the cs4 upgrade software.</s><s> 4. however when viewed by a one-man webmaster with a portfolio of 20 clients of which 3 might be willing to pay for ice, the economics look like: 1 domain costs min $120 max $ 240 per annum 2 domains cost min $ 60 max $ 120 3 domains cost min $ 40 max $ 80 4 domains cost min $ 30 max $ 60 5 domains cost min $ 24 max $ 48 (a) he has no idea what to charge as he doesn't know how many of his clients will (a) want it (b) pay for it (c) pay the appropriate amount (d) how long it will take to bring them on stream.</s><s> (b) he bears the burden of risk that he might end up paying the full subscription but not get the clients to pay (c) he may have a time lag in bringing on 5 clients to maximise the value of his subscription.</s><s> 6. wouldn't it be nice if adobe would share the risk, the stress and the rewards with its client webmasters by having exactly the same interests as them, and address many of the concerns raised in recent days on this forum by setting a single price per domain added - say $30 per domain per annum (a) the webmaster will add the service as and when he needs it.</s><s> (b) the revenue to adobe and cost to the webmaster is the same.</s><s> this ensures transparency and consistency across all clients.</s><s> (transparency seems to be sorely lacking from this product/service so far) (c) the marginal cost and marginal revenue are the same for all clients of adobe and for clients of the webmasters.</s><s> those clients will get a fair deal, rather than the early ones being stung and the later ones getting a cheaper service.</s><s> (d) in the end the final client (the webmaster's client) will determine the success of this product.</s><s> if they like it they'll ask their webmasters for it and recommend it to others.</s><s> if they discover they're all getting differing prices for the same service they will not be endorsing it.</s><s> let's look after the end customer here which will be good for adobe and the webmasters too.</s><s> good, simple, fair services will result in maket share, not the ill-conceived and complex pricing model proposed in your message.</s><s> in summary folks, isn't a "pay-as-you-go" service fairer and more transparent all round?</s><s> the cs4 buyers and webmaster users in this and other forums will ultimately determine whether you make the right decision, or whether the many alternative offerings mentioned in this form are the most sensible option.</s><s> clandonman t

<s>i agree witrh what everyone is saying.</s><s> i know i'm being more lienient on adobe than most others.</s><s> i hope no one is thinking i'm letting them off the hook or down playing their lack of tranparency.</s><s> my point is, if you have a client ready to hire you because you can offer incontext, don't lose that client because of the pricing.</s><s> as for a pricing model, they should follow the same as their adobe connect service.</s><s> from what i understand, it's based on the amount of people who can join a meeting.</s><s> it's free for meetings of 3.</s><s> if you have more people, it cost money.</s><s> replace the people attending for domains.</s><s> you can have the first 3 free, then you pay annual or monthly subscription fees to allow more domains.

<s>the pricing model must include that the web designers can make a buck, too.</s><s> why would i offer a self-editing service when i can now charge them for doing it?</s><s> the self editors will run into problems and turn around and ask me to fix it.</s><s> they will not be willing to pay my time and instead blame me for recommending a "faulty product".</s><s> i would like to be able to charge my customer a reasonable monthly fee for bearing the risk to have to troubleshoot their self-editing endavors.</s><s> this being said, the customers who are interested in doing it themselves, are the ones with the small budget.</s><s> so $10/month for them is a lot.</s><s> if adobe does not support the needs of web designers, they will not recommend and implement it.

<s>i went ahead and opened a free account at cushycms.</s><s> i like it so far.</s><s> unfortunately, i don't have cs4, so i can't really compair it to incontext.</s><s> as far as taking on a risk by enabling the client to edit the page, i only give access to the content of the page with cushcms.</s><s> so, basically, all they can do is change out pictures and reword text.</s><s> granted, i am still opening myself up to some risk, but i don't think it is uncalculated risk.</s><s> besides, i think the rewards outweigh the risk.</s><s> first off, it is a service that will help me market my own services.</s><s> secondly, it will help me be more efficient.</s><s> sure i will have to check what they do, but i won't get 20 emails asking me to change a word and then changing it back.</s><s> it will free me up to work on other projects.</s><s> i will be careful not to miscommunicate to my clients and have them think they are on their own.</s><s> i'm still very hands on with them, just this helps with some of the more medial stuff.</s><s> also, not to get off topic on the pricing, here is my basic workflow.</s><s> we all have our own way of doing things, but this might help deter you from thinking something like this is too risky.</s><s> 1) i use version cue so i can always go back and restore a previous version if things get too messed up.</s><s> 2) i created a subdomain.</s><s> for instance, if my client is widgets with www.widgets.com; i create widgets.itlogic.org.</s><s> this servers as their testing server.</s><s> 3) i enabled cushycms to edit the pages on that testing server, not the live server.</s><s> 4) once they are done, they email me.</s><s> i check what they did and if i approve it, i get their edited pages from the testing server and save them to me computer.</s><s> i then put the new pages on their live site.</s><s> that way i actually publish the pages live, not them.</s><s> 5) as i mentioned, if things get too out of wack, i restore the previous version of the page from version cue and re-upload that to the testing server.</s><s> then the page is back to square one and we can try again.
