<s>the program works and does its job - thanks a lot.</s><s> it has one problem - the definition is very poor when trying to select an adobe video.</s><s> the trial version only downloads a small part of a video, but enough to see how it works.</s><s> as far as i can make out using a magnifying glass to read the screen text, it will do the whole thing if purchased for $45 approx (usually about $95) i am not sure that i will buy it at that price unless there is a possibility of changing the text size in the interface.</s><s> you also have little if any control over where you save the videos.</s><s> i solved this by working out where the files were stored.</s><s> in c:/programfilesx86/c:/downloads/ and including this folder in the videos library, so that i can test the output without having to dig too deep in the system.</s><s> will come back and report any developments later.</s><s> as to the whatallotofrubbish username, i tried about 30 normal usernames when i first registered a product in december 2002 with no success.</s><s> when i finally typed in whatalotofrubbish, it worked.</s><s> why change something if it works ok.

<s>one small problem - i cannot save a download from adobe tv. if i find the url i can put it in the source box and view it, but it only works when connected to the web, unlike the other videos by other companies, many of which are heavily spotted with adverts or are just taster videos that you have to subscribe to.</s><s> most of the videos are for early versions of dreamweaver, though i did find about 6 that were for cs6.</s><s> have you figured out how to download from tv.adobe.com ?</s><s> this is what i get when i try:- 

</s><s>if you try to log on while in the miro screen, then the program reports that adobe has no certificates and refuses to connect.</s><s> i assume that this is to prevent other users from accessing their videos?

<s>hi howard, 
</s><s>my approach in miro is this: first i search at youtube for my wishes, so for example: http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dreamweaver+tutorial&oq=dr eamweaver+t&gs_l=youtube.1.0.0l10.1133.7961.0.10401.13.9.0.4.4.0.111.7 11.7j2.9.0...0.0...1ac.1.cxjwnybsruk 
</s><s>also here it is valid: if this search produces too many hits, you can refine and modify your search to suit your needs. 
</s><s>after that i use miro's search function with youtubes keywords, so i get really these videos miro is able to save.</s><s> but you are right, sometimes miro (and others) are not able to load them down..</s><s> there are several possible reasons.</s><s> one of them that they are (esp. in germany) protected by copyright laws. 
</s><s>needless to say, that nevertheless, a wide variety of programs are circulating in the net with which one is able to do this (sometimes).
