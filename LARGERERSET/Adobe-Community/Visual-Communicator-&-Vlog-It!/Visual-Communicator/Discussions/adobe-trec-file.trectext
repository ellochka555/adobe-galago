<s>i have just read that the current edition of adobe visual communicator has been out for 3 years.</s><s> i have piloted it since last spring and have finally reached the point where i have to abandon it and move on.</s><s> i think the idea behind this software is fantastic, but the controls are not intuitive, and the features are not reliable.</s><s> i just spent hours working on a piece that incorporated images (jpg's) and short wmv video clips (320-240), as well as my own webcam.</s><s> during rehearsal, record, and review, the webcam image came across just fine, especially during review.</s><s> but when i went to publish it as an flv for upload to our learning management system (canvas), the webcam video disappeared.</s><s> i am supposed to be able to rotate and crop images but the changes would not take.</s><s> even after i read the documentation and followed the steps religiously, the result was completely null.

<s>thanks, rick, 
</s><s>believe me, i know about captivate and presenter.</s><s> so know.</s><s> i use them every day.</s><s> (as a matter of fact i administrate the adobe connect system at the university of st. francis in joliet).</s><s> i love these products. 
</s><s>but, it's difficult to impossible to get faculty to take the time to learn captivate, and now that it's up to version 6, it's even more complicated than ever before.</s><s> i'm of the opinion that users need only need to know enough about a software to be productive with it, and i've read somewhere that users can even learn only 20% of a given product's features and be highly productive.</s><s> but getting an instructor to take on that "20% challenge" i'll call it is daunting after they've taken a look at the captivate interface.</s><s> presenter, on the other hand, is much easier. 
</s><s>it's that ease that i was hoping for with avc.</s><s> i'll say again: a tool that would enable educators to seamlessly add narration, images, video clips (mp4, wmv, mov, ... it doesn't matter), and other objects with instant ease would be a boon for the academic consumer market.</s><s> a boon.</s><s> so many things can now be presented visually on the web: where's the software to make it easy, instantly? 
</s><s>i've a long history with adobe, and macromedia.</s><s> adobe has created products in the past that have revolutionized accessibility, with its great pdf platform.</s><s> instructors use pdfs all the time now.</s><s> adobe, historically, had positioned itself to be the software maker for educators.</s><s> the key word in that previous sentence is "had". 
</s><s>after adobe bought macromedia and adopted and improved upon its suite of products, the emphasis clearly, to me, shifted over to developers and high-end entrepreneurs;-- not educators.</s><s> for an academic like me who happens to be not only geeky but an instructional designer serving faculty, you can't imagine how frustrating it is to receive a product like dreamweaver, captivate, flash, and others and not be able to champion those to faculty.</s><s> why?</s><s> learning curve and complexity-- that's all. 
</s><s>adobe could easily return to creating products for masters of language, arts, and sciences; not masters of object-oriented programming, actionscript and javascript.</s><s> and it should. 
a product like avc represents an idea that needs to be cultivated, not left unrealized. 
</s><s>thank you so much for listening! 
</s><s>glen gummess 
</s><s>p.s.</s><s> i've started using edge preview.</s><s> again, an opportunity for ease of use which is unfortunately hampered by a requirement to know javascript.</s><s> make it automatically usable.</s><s> incorporate software design principles for the lowest common denominator.</s><s> that should be the goal, or at least one important goal among the many for adobe.

<s>message contains a reply to this thread and a solution to my illegal op problem! 
</s><s>my reply to this thread: 
actually, there are many causes of the illegal operation.</s><s> since this thread was titled "illegal operation on vc", it will collect all illegal operation commentary, such as my own.</s><s> it could have been titled "getting illegal operation with vc3 after avs manager install freezes" but then we'd end up with a 100 different threads for every single iop variant.</s><s> so, with respect and for efficiency, i'll add my iop issue comments here. 
</s><s>in my case, any use of vc3 while it has not yet completed initializing it's avs manager (and perhaps other add-ins) produces an illegal operation but with different register data since different function calls are being made.</s><s> the trigger of the illegal operation was not specifically related to visuals or graphic results, as in your case, but by the simple invocation of any dependent functions of the avs subsystem *before* the avs manager was initiated. 
</s><s>another major coding error is that vc3 allows the use of most functions homed within the main window when, in fact, the splash (initialization) screen has not finished installing or initiating the add-ins that many of them require - that's just atrociously unacceptable programming.</s><s> the avs manager is used by many functions and, empirically speaking, it seems responsible for linking to your machine's audio, graphics, and video subsystems. 
</s><s>so, when it is not yet fully installed and instantiated, then all those functions that depend on it will cause an illegal operation when attempting to invoke it.</s><s> the result is that it ends up jumping to invalid addresses and/or register data - a common cause of illegal operations. 
</s><s>solution to my own illegal operation issue found: 
</s><s>while re-researching this problem, i got a decent 2nd level support person in new delhi who inadvertently led me to find a circuitous method that may have at least temporarily fixed the avs manager init freeze.</s><s> he walked me through the usual disabling of all non-essential boot time features and the complete removal of norton - all of which i had tried before.</s><s> after a valiant and considerate effort for his support level, he quit and escalated the issue to 3rd level with a trouble ticket that may take a week to hear back on. 
</s><s>however, after the call, while putting things back to normal, vc3 started working!</s><s> here's what may have fixed this problem (this time): 
after the call, while i was still booting with minimal services and no protection, i reinstalled my norton 2011.</s><s> still no joy - as expected. 
i then reboot using the "diagnostic startup" button (basic services only) option in msconfig.</s><s> norton loaded again but alerted that i needed an 80 mb update which was unusually large and was not noted when i upgraded from 2010 earlier in the day.</s><s> i ran it.</s><s> no joy.</s><s> and, yes, vc3 still failed the same way with nis 2010, before i upgraded to 2011. 
i then revisited msconfig and used the "enable all services" button to turn everything back on and reboot.</s><s> voila, vc3 ran ok.</s><s> i didn't believe my eyes, at first.</s><s> so, now i feel a tad better since it at least starts up and has only the usual crashes! 
</s><s>so, the fix to my illegal operation crash due to failed avs manager init just *may* have been as follows: ran msconfig, startup tab, hide ms services, disable all services, reboot uninstall nis 2011 (it's ok to save passwords and data).</s><s> reboot.</s><s> after all that, no change to problem.</s><s> vc still crashed.</s><s> re-installed norton to put hings back as before.</s><s> reboot.</s><s> ran msconfig, clicked "dagnostic startup" to ensure "basic services only".</s><s> reboot.</s><s> updated norton, in case of pending updates (i had 80mb waiting).</s><s> reboot.</s><s> still no joy.</s><s> vc still crashed on start up.</s><s> ran msconfig, re-enabled all services.</s><s> reboot.</s><s> vc3 splash screen blew past "creating avs manager" and started working! 
</s><s>theory: the above remedy suggests that, as a result of the countless updates installed for windows 7, norton, silverlight, adobe products (i have the master collection), air, flash, opengl, directx, ad nauseum, certain drivers and/or subsystems had changed name, ownership, security level, or some such other system attribute that made it/them become locked out or inaccessible due to windows and/or norton's intrinsic security features. 
</s><s>by disabling all non-essential services, uninstalling norton, re-installing and updating norton still with minimum services, rebooting, then re-enabling all services and rebooting again, the system objects were once again allowed to be accessed by vc3 so it could complete the avs manager initialization and avoid the iop issue.</s><s> the theory fits my situation but doesn't completely explain why vc3 didn't run when norton was totally removed! 
</s><s>one simple thing i did not try was to simply use mscofig to enable all services and reboot just in case some needed service had been disabled by me, windows, norton, adobe, et al, somewhere along the path of a 100 installs and 1,000 updates. 
</s><s>now that i just have typical vc3 crashes, i can deal with my audio being slightly out of sync whether using direct pc audio or audio passed from my camcorder's mic over the 1394 (firewire) connection.</s><s> but, please, y'all, no responses here.</s><s> that's another thread which i'll add to or create. 
</s><s>closing thoughts: vc3, though it's not cheap and adobe's most unstable product, it is still the only affordable live video producer in town.</s><s> it's just disconcerting to hear adobe speak of how little the product is used in response questions regarding the dearth of online vc support collateral.</s><s> on the other hand, i've also heard whispers that vc4 is at least being discussed, if not in the pipeline.

<subject>Illegal Operation on Visual Communicator</subject>
<post author="randycurtis" timestamp="Oct 30, 2010 2:38 PM">
<s>subject: re: [visual communicator] illegal operation on visual  communicator thank you so much for the best response i have had and  adobe should make you a tier 4 tech i have sort of a fix for sync issues that i also have had since using vc2 and vc3 for several years.  i found that if i wish to do a 30 minute show that i need to record about 14 minutes of it then stop and then continue the second half.  it seems that the frame rate eventually will put you out of sync in files longer then 14 or so minutes.  i also minimize how many bells and whistles i put in production and veer away from dropping in lots of videos or fancy two box or animated special features vc3 offers.   if i keep it to mostly pictures and camera in then i seem to have better chance of getting through a show.</s><s> as mentioned in many threads audio must come through the camcorder you have hooked up and not through video card.</s><s> i will try your patch solution for avs manager crash that i have on more then one computer to see if i can duplicate your success.   edit:  i tried but nothing for me i still have error code ....oh well i have one computer using vc2 that hangs on splash checking for updates and if i try to reboot my system a dial up screen comes up and when i close it the computer jumps into vc2   not exactly the way your supposed to use it but it works for now as i deal with my other computers not working at all.  i have 3 liscense's so i can use up to 6 computers but at this point only have one crippled older version working.</s><s> wish i could use the vc3 features like animated lower thirds but not at  present.</s><s> does anyone know how to create more animated lower thirds or adjust the ones in vc3 i find that  you can't edit the ones in it and you can't use the ultra graphics in vc as serious magic or adobe prioritized their files to be incompatible with the others.</s><s> anyway just some other questions  that i wonder about....one last thing anyone know of another green screen, teleprompter pc software like this or how to get rss feed ticker on my production without having to republish in another editing program?</s><s> it would be nice to be able to use the cg editor in vc to create something like that

<s>there are perhaps several different reasons why various people have this problem.</s><s> i too had it and it was very bewildering.</s><s> i began to suspect that upon start up visual communicator was initializing an asset that was either corrupted, renamed or absent.

</s><s>click properties 
</s><s>left hand panel you will have a option that says: "advanced system settings" - click it 
system properties will open up - make sure that you are under the "advanced" tab 
first option will be "performance settings" - click it 
click the "data execution prevention" tab 
choose the second option " turn on dep for all programs and services except those i select" 
</s><s>click "add" 
</s><s>browse to: c:\program files\ adobe\ visual comunicator 3\ bin\visualcomnicator3.exe -- choose the exe file

<s>i too now have the same issue and error message as chiquadrat with my new hp win7 with radion hd 6770m super-d-duper notebook computer.  this product is definitely worth putting money into just to keep it current with new technology such as video hardware and video now being usb and not firewire, etc.  i really love this product, but it is a shame that there are install issues that probably have no merit.  i previously had this loaded on my new computer and had the errors for a while and then, out of nowhere, it started working.  i just installed cs5.5 master collection and when i went back to check my vc3, it said i had errors now and had to uninstall it and reinstall it, so i went through all of that and now have the video error again.   i'm hoping it just decides to go away again, but that makes using this software on this new computer highly unreliable and that's not good when your teaching.  stability and consistency means everything.  i really hope adobe steps up and improves vc!  although, i'm not surprised to see that there hasn't been any customer support help here, given the really poor customer service experience i've had with my cs5.5 master collection install errors.  come on adobe!   get this application up and running strong with today's technology!

<s>up to know i run live streaming through our steaming server using fms and flash media live encoder as we only needed one camera for live video feeds.</s><s> we are looking at the ability now to use 2 live cameras and also the ability to snap in pre recorded video during live feeds and also provide lower third titles.</s><s> i am looking at: adobe visual communicator 3 wirecast 4 cutfour all of these provide the possible live switching i need.</s><s> i'm at the moment looking at the trial version of visual communicator and i am struggling getting my head around a few things.</s><s> i can hook up 2 -3 sony a1 hd cameras in sd no problem and running it though fms is fine.</s><s> during test streams clicking on the cameras using the mini switcher is straight forward. howevr i am struggling to work out how to do the following: add prerecorded video clips to camera 3?</s><s> ( in the setup tab it says " no camera found - please connect a camera or replace with photo or video clip) how do i replace with a video clip?</s><s> how do i add premade titles, so that during the live feed i can put lower third titles in?</s><s> finally, how do provide an intro looping video to play before the live feed starts?</s><s> any instructions would be appreciated

<s>i have decided to ditch visual communicator as an option. 
</s><s>apart from the poor support, i have tested the trial version and it would not make sense to use the application in its cirrent form. 
</s><s>in a ten minute period using 2 cameras as a test, the application froze and crashed four times.</s><s> not acceptable as reliability is crucial. 
</s><s>the test was done on a windows 7 64 bit machine with 4 physical xeon quad core 3ghz processors and 32 gb ram with a 2gb graphics card, so performance was not the issue. 
the application is just not stable. 
i am getting better support and results from both wirecast 4 and cutfour.

</s><s>if there is no support or if adobe has no one with the knowledge to support products then please either remove the forums or ditch the software.

<subject>VC3 will not allow me to resize, crop, or flip images in Windows 7!  Possible Bug?</subject>
<post author="Greek2U" timestamp="Jun 3, 2011 5:55 PM">
<s>i have tried adjusting images in vc3 with windows xp and have had no problem.</s><s> however, after testing this unsuccessfully in windows 7 with two different brands of computers, i am almost positive this is a bug with the new operating system.</s><s> adjusting png images however works perfectly so the jpg file format seems to be the issue.</s><s> can anyone else that is using windows 7 confirm whether adjusting jpg images (flipping, cropping, resizing, etc.</s><s>) works for them in vc3?</s><s> there is simply no response from my program when i attempted these functions.</s><s> the image just stays in its default state. 
</s><s>adobe tech support was absolutely no help on this when i contacted them (what a joke).</s><s> i have been pulling my hair out over this issue for days now so i am desperate for an answer from anyone who uses this program with windows 7. thank you in advance.

<s>welcome to our community, steve 
while visual communicator *might* be able to do this (and i'll leave that for rob z or another to answer) you might investigate a freeware product called screen monkey. 
</s><s>click here to visit the screen monkey site 
i've been using screen monkey quite successfully at the church i attend and volunteer by operating the media pc.</s><s> granted, i'm only switching between a single camera feed and powerpoint presentation, but if you had multiple video streams i believe screen monkey would allow you to manage that too. 
</s><s>screen monkey won't do anything with recording the separate feeds though.</s><s> you will likely need another software for that.</s><s> i might imagine it would severely tax the computer to try and record as many as four webcam feeds.</s><s> but one possibility is to connect multiple computers with each having its own video feed and recording and feed their outputs into the main computer where you are operating the live show. 
</s><s>cheers and best of luck to you!</s><s> rick
