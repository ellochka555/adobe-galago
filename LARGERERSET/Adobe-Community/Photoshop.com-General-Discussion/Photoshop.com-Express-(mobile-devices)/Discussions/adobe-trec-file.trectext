<s>hi, 
</s><s>since you have upgraded to a new phone you would require to restore your purchases in order to use the premium features previously bought.to do this you have to follow the below steps - 
1-launch photoshop express on your iphone 5s 2-goto settings 3- in the settings menu scroll down to option to "restore purchases" 4-tap on restore purchses and complete the workflow by entering your apple id and password(the same apple id with which you previously bought the premium feature) 
</s><s>this should restore all your purchases on the new phone. 
</s><s>let me know if this solves your problem or you are still facing issues. 
</s><s>thanks, shuchi
