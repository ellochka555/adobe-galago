<s>there's a known incompatibility with chrome beta (chrome 34), which will be fixed in the next release of edge code.</s><s> is that the version you were on before? 
</s><s>in terms of sass/compass -- the current release of edge code only notices externally-modified files if you leave the edge code window and then come back.</s><s> the next version of edge code will do a much better job of recognizing changes instantly & automatically. 
</s><s>in the meantime, with the current release, you should be able to trigger edge code to check by quickly alt-tabbing to a different app and then back.</s><s> but the trick is if you do it too soon after saving your sass edits (before the background sass->css compilation is done) then there won't be any css file change to notice yet.</s><s> but hopefully knowing that's what triggers the check for changes will at least make it feel a little more predictable for now.

<s>you can upvote that feature here: https://trello.com/c/io24byhm/910-drag-and-drop-selected-text-within-e ditor 
in the meantime, there are some other shortcuts that i find very useful for moving around blocks of text: ctrl+d to duplicate line (or duplicate selection, if you have text selected) ctrl+shift+up/down to move the current line or selected block up/down in one-line increments ctrl+shift+d to delete the current line(s) ctrl+l to select the current line, or add the next line to the selection there are also a few extensions that let you select syntactic blocks in curly-brace languages and in html.

<s>thanks peter, i thought that might be the case.</s><s> the 2 reasons i think an internal history diff tool would be appreciated are: some places i've worked don't have version control or don't have it for that specific project.</s><s> many people coming from the design world aren't going to be using a centralized version control.</s><s> they're likely to not have the knowledge or desire to use anything beyond dropbox or a server share to work with.</s><s> with either of those, people are missing a great personal benifit of being able to roll back any set of changes in a visible fashion so they're free to explore changes as quickly as they think of them.</s><s> setting up git, svn, etc. can be a big barrier to entry for most people.</s><s> i think it can help people do good work if the functionality can be the same whether they're using an edge-specific feature or an integration with version control (or almost version control with cloud sync tools).

<s>kojoman, 
</s><s>how old is the hardware you're running?</s><s> is disk access unusually slow, perhaps?</s><s> are you launching brackets while other apps are doing a lot of work in the background? 
</s><s>if there are no other errors listed above that one, it typically means that it simply took a long time (i think > 7 seconds) for certain js files to be loaded from disk.</s><s> (it could also indicate the files are flat-out missing -- so you could try uninstalling & reinstalling edge code to make sure your installation didn't become corrupt).
