<s>selective color matching open the image with color you like.</s><s> make sure your info palette is visible.</s><s> select the eyedropper tool.</s><s> look at the options bar, and set the sample size to 5 x 5.</s><s> this will give you a good average color from a sample size larger than just one individual pixel.</s><s> hold the shift key, and you'll see that the cursor changes.</s><s> this signifies that you're ready to lay down a color sampler.</s><s> find a good spot to sample the color you want, and click there.</s><s> you may lay down up to 4 color samplers in each image.</s><s> look at your info palette and you'll see that it has expanded to now include a pane (or panes) that display(s) the color component make-up of the spot (or spots) where you dropped a color sampler (or samplers).</s><s> in that pane you'll see a tiny little eyedropper icon, right below the "#1".</s><s> click and hold for a drop-down menu.</s><s> change the read-out to cmyk.</s><s> this won't change the color-mode of your image, so don't worry about that.</s><s> it just makes the following steps more intuitive.</s><s> write down the values for c, m, y, and k. open the second image in which you want to match the color to a similar color in the first.</s><s> now, for one of the most important parts of the process: make an accurate selection of the areas you want to adjust.</s><s> save it as an alpha channel (select---"save selection...new channel) just to be on the safe side, and save your changes to the document.</s><s> using the eyedropper again, shift-click to drop a color sampler in the new image, in an area that is similar in brightness as the sampler in image 1.</s><s> change the readout of this new sampler to cmyk.</s><s> with your object still selected, go to "image---"adjustments---"selective color..." choose a color in the drop-down menu that is as close as possible to the color of the area you want to adjust.</s><s> now, while you keep an eye on the color sampler pane in the info palette, adjust the sliders in the selective color dialogue.</s><s> you'll see the numbers change in the info palette.</s><s> the numbers to the left of the slashes (/) are the "before" readouts, the numbers to the right of the slashes are the "after" readouts.</s><s> play around adjusting these selective color sliders until the "after" numbers for the second image color sampler match (or get really close to) the c, m, y and k values you wrote down for the color sampler in the first image.</s><s> sometimes you'll need to work the sliders for more than one of the selective color drop-down menu colors.</s><s> i usually start with the drop-down choice of "neutrals," because it often allows me to do most of the correction there...lots of bang-for-the-buck.</s><s> also, you may need to make selective color adjustments, hit "ok" and then call the selective color dialogue up a secondperhaps even a thirdtime.</s><s> just match the "after" numbers for image 2 to the before numbers that you wrote down for image 1.</s><s> there are other methods for doing this, but this is one of the easiest ways.</s><s> keep in mind that the changes you make are destructive (i.e.: not reversible after you save and close the document).</s><s> because i trust my abilities, i know what i can get away with, and i'm usually satisfied with the results.</s><s> if you have any worries about making permanent changes, just duplicate the layer you want to work on so you can go back to the original color if you need to.</s><s> when you're finished, you remove the color samplers by again selecting the eyedropper tool and (shift+option) [shift+alt] clicking (see the scissors cursor?</s><s>) on the color sampler icon (s) in the image window.

<s>before you do anything, make sure you exit photoshop!</s><s> otherwise you may experience problems.  the second step is to open the photoshop program folder.</s><s> on windows, this is "c:\program files\adobe\photoshop " by default.</s><s> if you installed the application with the creative suite or if you customized the installation path, this may vary, though.</s><s> if you are on a macintosh (lucky you :), i think you somehow need to open the application package to access the files.</s><s> i don't know any details of how to do this, and i am not even sure this method works on a mac, as i don't have access to one.</s><s> i'm afraid you are on your own there.</s><s> feel free to post your results here.</s><s> ok, now look into the "required" subfolder.</s><s> there you will find two files, one named "tw10428.dat", and one named "tw12508.dat".</s><s> depending on you photoshop version, you may have only one of these.</s><s> these files contain the localized text strings (i.e. the translations of the menu items and dialog boxes and all that stuff) for your photoshop.</s><s> the trick is to rename these files, so photoshop won't be able to access them.</s><s> i advise you to append ".bak" (for backup) to the file name, so you can change back later if you want to.</s><s> i would recommend against deleting them.</s><s> if you are on a photoshop version without activation, you are done now.</s><s> start photoshop the way you usually do, and the interface should appear in vintage us english.  if you are using newer version of photoshop which has the the beloved activation feature (the cs and cs2 versions if i remember correctly), you need to perform an additional step.</s><s> if you skip this, photoshop won't start because the activation wizard thinks it's being fooled.</s><s> in the main photoshop application folder, go to the "activation" subfolder.</s><s> there you will find another subfolder named with your language acronym (eg.</s><s> "de_de" in the german version).</s><s> rename this folder to "en_us".</s><s> now you can start photoshop, and the interface language has changed.</s><s> if you want to switch back to your native version, just rename the files and folder as the were before.  if anything went wrong (i told you you are doing this at your own risk!</s><s>), don't despair, a re-install of the application should fix your problems.   message was edited by: captiv8r - spam links destroyed

<s>overview logo design is one of those specialty skills that a designer can use to set himself apart from the rest of his competition.</s><s> thats not to say that you are a bad designer if you dont like doing logos (just between you and me, i hate doing them), but the ability to craft solid, identifiable and versatile logos is not a talent to be taken lightly.</s><s> creating a logo is one of the most difficult tasks that a designer can take.</s><s> its an art form, really; a corporate-sanctioned, sterilized symbol of stature and it can make or break a company all in less than one second.

<s>general thoughts a good logo must do the following things: 1) serve as a recognizable symbol for a service, company, organization or product; 2) convey that entitys image, message or process in less than a second; 3) it must be instantly recognizable; 4) it must be memorable; 5) it has to be versatile and 6) it must look as if youve seen the logo a thousand times, even if its the first time youve actually looked at the logo.</s><s> its very easy to create a bad logo.</s><s> just look around, bad logo design is everywhere.</s><s> its on the sides of plumbing trucks; on billboards; on bus benches; on crappy chinese takeout menus; in print ads; on tv commercials theyre everywhere.</s><s> and even though theyre all around you, how many do you really remember?</s><s> did they make you stand up and notice?</s><s> if you saw them again, would you really remember the logo?</s><s> would you associate it with a quality service?</s><s> would it make you want to call upon that company or organization?</s><s> a logo is an organizations public identity.</s><s> it does so much more than just serve as an image that states a companys name.</s><s> if a logo looks cheap or ill conceived, i guarantee you that it will reflect poorly on that companys public image.</s><s> it doesnt really matter how good the product is or how well a service is performed, if a companys primary means of branding and corporate identity looks like an afterthought, the company itself will be tainted in the public eye.</s><s> think of the good logos youve seen.</s><s> you think of things like the nike swoosh, the golden arches of mcdonalds and the prestigious mercedes emblem.</s><s> three different logos picked at random, yet instantly identifiable in your mind.</s><s> the logo just pops into your minds eye when i mention apple, coca-cola, starter.</s><s> you look at these logos and you think of quality, you think of reputation, you think: how would i look wearing that?</s><s> sure theres a lot of marketing money behind those logos.</s><s> theres a lot of history and tradition that accompanies those corporate symbols.</s><s> but you also need to remember that these logos once started out with no huge amounts of financial backing or tradition to help serve the identity.</s><s> at one point they were new designs fresh off of some artist or designers drafting table or sketchpad.</s><s> and though the years have passed, these logos have remained virtually unchanged and true to their original form.</s><s> why do you think that is?</s><s> there could be many reasons, not all of which are related to good logo design and theory.</s><s> there have been many good logos designed throughout the years that have symbolized really crappy companies (think about the dot.com boom and subsequent bust).</s><s> its true that a good logo wont single handedly make a company successful.</s><s> it also wont be the reason for an organizations downfall.</s><s> but a good logo is important to a companys public face, and in a world where perception is often more powerful than fact, its important to make sure that your outward appearance is as effective as it can possibly be.

<s>preparation before you even do so much as a thumbnail, do your research.</s><s> examine the intent of the logo, the company, its product or purpose in as much detail as possible.</s><s> talk to members of the companys marketing department or ownership if possible.</s><s> listen carefully to what they say about their company (and how they say it).</s><s> get a feel for the excitement they have towards their product or service and adopt it.</s><s> immerse yourself in the intricacies of the business.</s><s> dont just know what they do; understand what they do.</s><s> ask whatever questions you deem important to help you comprehend the public identity they wish to convey through their logo (and subsequent print materials, i.e. corporate identity items like business cards, letterhead and envelopes).</s><s> believe me, it will help in the long run when it comes time to actually sit down and design the logo.</s><s> the other important thing you need to do is research.</s><s> research the name of the company.</s><s> usually it means something, whether it is a persons name or a word pulled out from a dictionaryusually that word or name was chosen for a reason.</s><s> find out why it was chosen, what it means and where it came from.</s><s> research the logos of the competitors.</s><s> see what theyve done.</s><s> see if their logos hit the mark or miss the point.</s><s> teach yourself to learn from their wisdom or their mistakes.</s><s> you can find a lot of inspiration and direction with a little dedication and willingness to put some time in on research.</s><s> it doesnt matter if the company is a brand new startup, or has been around for 100 years.</s><s> either way, theres no way you can know a company better than those who run it, so take the time to learn what you need to learn in order to understand the task at hand.</s><s> once youve done your research and have a good idea of the message the logo needs to convey, youre ready to sit down and start your thumbnails.</s><s> do at least 50 thumbnails; more if necessary and sort out the different variations and design elements you have in your head.</s><s> it will help you in the long run to identify the attributes and designs that you will use when building your logo.</s><s> its a good idea to show a client several different logo options.</s><s> i will usually show no fewer than ten distinctly different designs to a client.</s><s> from that initial presentation, the client may choose a logo out right.</s><s> he may ask for some revisions.</s><s> or he may ask to see a whole new set of logos.</s><s> either way, you should have enough information from that first presentation to hone your approach and better define your strategies for the particular logo.

<s>programs the program one chooses when building a logo is actually far more important that many people realize; even seasoned professionals.</s><s> in order to achieve maximum versatility (in terms of size, ease of editing, and format conversion) its very important to design using a vector-based illustration program.</s><s> the three biggest vector illustration programs are adobe illustrator (the most widely used), corel draw (my personal favorite), and macromedia freehand.</s><s> one can expect to pay between $500-$700 for each program, individually.</s><s> some are available as part of larger software collections and can be found bundled with other programs for around $1000 (adobes design collection being a notable example; get illustrator, photoshop, indesign and acrobat), or as competitive upgrades (if you already own a qualifying product) for as little as $150.</s><s> choosing the right program is of paramount importance when beginning any project.</s><s> a vector program when doing logo design is akin to using an image editor to touch up a photo, or a layout program to design an ad. sure, one can use an image editing program like photoshop to design a logo or create an ad layout, but it really isnt what the software is designed to do, and as a result, you will encounter limitations of some varying degrees.</s><s> so why would one use a vector illustration program instead of an image editor or layout program when designing a logo?</s><s> one word: versatility.</s><s> an illustration program uses a series of mathematical points and lines to create images.</s><s> this gives the logo the ability to be scaled to any size without any loss of image quality.</s><s> additionally, an illustration program offers the ease of simplicity when converting to any other graphics file format.</s><s> for example, a native illustrator file can be exported/saved to tiff, jpeg, psd, eps, gif, svg, bmp or pdf file formats.</s><s> its easy to go from vector to raster, but in many cases its nearly impossible to go from raster to vector.</s><s> there are some programs like adobe streamline or corel trace that do a decent job in converting simple raster images to vector file, but struggle in maintaining realism with more photorealistic images.</s><s> vector files usually also result in smaller file sizes when compared to their raster counterparts, which serves as an added benefit when storing or emailing files.</s><s> since vector images also use mathematical points do define the image, output to printing devices will yield sharper images at all sizes than identical raster images.</s><s> an image editor uses pixels to define an image.</s><s> the plus side to this is that a greater range of photorealism is achievable and a variety of specialty effects can be applied.</s><s> the problem is three-fold.</s><s> the first problem is that photorealism and special effects actually work against good logo design (as will be discussed a little later).</s><s> secondly, since an image-editing program does depend on pixels, not mathematical points, it cannot be scaled without loss of quality.</s><s> one can shrink the logo to a fair degree and still maintain image quality, but the logo cannot be scaled upwards without losing integrity.</s><s> doing so can result in image blurriness or pixilation (both of which are not desirable).</s><s> since one would need to create a logo that would be the most versatile, that logo would need to be initially created with such size and resolution that the mere file size would likely prohibit effective utilization on most computers and applications.</s><s> lastly, raster images arent easily converted to vector-based formats.</s><s> this limits the logo to formats like tiff, jpeg, psd, bmp, gif and pdf formats.</s><s> these formats will work for most print applications (newspapers, magazines, posters, etc), but not so well for things like vinyl signs, embossing/engraving or promotional products, where the vendors work almost exclusively with vector images.</s><s> though it doesnt happen as much, some choose to use a layout program as the primary means of logo creation.</s><s> this just adds difficulty to an already challenging undertaking.</s><s> where tiff, eps, pdf, jpeg and bmp files will pretty much work in any layout application, files designed in quark, pagemaker, indesign or (gasp) any of the microsoft products (word, excel, powerpoint, publisher) are pretty much only good in the program that created it and not generally as versatile.</s><s> one has to jump though hoops in order to get a layout program-based logo into formats that can be utilized by other programs.</s><s> of all the layout programs, indesign is probably the layout program best suited toward logo creation because it has some of the basic illustration tools available in illustrator and has the most file format export options; it can also read native quark and pagemaker files.</s><s> quark and pagemaker do offer an export to eps option, but experience has shown me that to be a somewhat unpredictable experience.</s><s> one really has to know a great deal about all the individual program capabilities in order to get a layout program to export its creation to a format that can be utilized by other programs.</s><s> sometimes the only way is via a screen capture, scanning a printout or printing to a pdf file, which adds just another unnecessary step to an already time consuming process.</s><s> the bottom line is that for any project, one should choose the right tool for the right job.</s><s> for logo design, that tool is a vector illustration program.

<s>basic design its been my experience with logo design that the best logos are typically those that are square(ish) in nature.</s><s> there have been many good horizontal- or vertical-oriented logos, but the best and most versatile logos are square in nature.</s><s> now, dont take this too literally.</s><s> i dont necessarily mean that a logo has to be a square.</s><s> quite the contrary, it can be whatever shape you need it to be, a circle, an oval, a rectangle, a diamond whatever.</s><s> what i mean is that when you measure the logo end to end, it is roughly the same size as it is when measured from top to bottom.</s><s> the reason for this is pretty simple.</s><s> when a logo is designed, you need to design it for any possible application and space.</s><s> for example, if a company does a lot of corporate sponsorships, its logo might be placed at the bottom of a print ad alongside other sponsor logos.</s><s> if the logo was designed as a horizontal format and is placed in a vertical ad, the logo might be reduced to such a small size (if there are a number of sponsors) that it isnt as legible.</s><s> this is because the overall size of the logo is limited by the amount of available width in a particular layout.</s><s> if there isnt sufficient width available, the logo never achieves enough height to be legible.</s><s> the same is also true for vertically oriented logos.</s><s> to be legible, a vertically oriented logo is dependent upon having enough height to make up for the lack of width.</s><s> if an area is too small, a vertical logo can suffer the same fate as a horizontal logo.</s><s> the squarer is in its design, the less space it needs to be legible.</s><s> it can fit in any area, and do so without sacrificing either height or width.</s><s> its a little trick really for example, if you take the same instance of a corporate sponsorship as given earlier, a square logo can actually become more visible, more legible in less space than either a vertical or horizontal logo.

<s>logo design specifics: color one of the biggest mistakes designers make when creating a logo is through the use/choice of color.</s><s> it is very important that when designing a logo that the first version be a lineart version.</s><s> this means black ink on white paper.</s><s> no halftones, no drop shadows, beveling, embossing or tints of color; just solid black on white paper.</s><s> i dont care if it looks cool with the effects or different color.</s><s> the ultimate point is that if a logo works in its basic, most pure form, itll work anywhere.</s><s> the primary reasoning goes back to what i wrote about using a vector illustration program.</s><s> its about versatility.</s><s> engravers, coffee mug printers and sign makers need to work with solid images.</s><s> their craft just wont allow for the use of halftones, so if youve spent hours creating a really pimped out logo with bevels and drop shadows you might find yourself frantically trying to reproduce the logo in a lineart version when the client asks that the logo be engraved on a crystal trophy, bronze plaque or applied to a coffee mug.</s><s> so its best to design a logo from the ground up.</s><s> think of the lineart logo as your foundation.</s><s> once you have that, you can build anything you want upon it and be confident that no matter what comes ahead, that youll be able sleep easy knowing that your whole company image is built upon a solid foundation.</s><s> once you have your solid lineart version of the logo, you can then build upon it by adding in color.</s><s> keep in mind that a logo should have one or maybe two spot colors to it.</s><s> theres no print limitation that says you cant do more.</s><s> what you will find is a financial limitation.</s><s> the more colors you add, the more that logo is going to cost you to reproduce.</s><s> for example, i had a client that insisted that we put twelve different spot colors into his logo.</s><s> he pulled out a pantone book and marked all the colors that he said had to be in his logo.</s><s> i tried to warn him about the cost.</s><s> he wouldnt listen.</s><s> he wanted a good, consistent image and he wanted all the colors.</s><s> i pointed out that we could process out the colors and save money, but that he could experience color shifts.</s><s> he wanted to make sure that all the colors were identical across all media.</s><s> so we printed his business cards, just 500 of them.</s><s> he paid $2,000.</s><s> thats $4 per card.</s><s> hardly cost effective.</s><s> still, he liked his cards and the price didnt seem to matter.</s><s> okay, no big deal for me.</s><s> i hade a happy client and received a greater profit from the markup.</s><s> his true awakening came when he wanted to get his logo embroidered on some golf shirts to shell out in his company store.</s><s> each time he embroidered logo on a shirt it cost him $35.</s><s> the shirts themselves cost $40 each before the embroidery.</s><s> so just to break even, he would have to charge $75 for each shirt.</s><s> who here would pay that much for a t-shirt?</s><s> since a logo is part of a good consistent corporate image, you want to make sure that it always reproduces the same way.</s><s> the use of spot color is a great way to ensure that.</s><s> process color only invites press, registration and color issues as each vendor may lay the ink down differently.</s><s> your logo may come out too light, too dark, be muddy or, as mentioned earlier, not have color that is true to your original design.</s><s> it also has to be cost effective to reproduce.</s><s> so if you want to add color, do it.</s><s> but make sure that you do it responsible and keep the number of colors in check.

<s>logo design specifics: fonts proper font usage is another important consideration when building a logo.</s><s> there is no right or wrong font for any particular logo.</s><s> there is no logo god that will come down from the heavens and smite you if you choose the wrong font.</s><s> but there are some considerations to take into account.</s><s> script fonts are usually bad.</s><s> usually, script fonts are used to convey elegance or sophistication.</s><s> quite often they are detailed and use very fine lines that will disappear when printed at smaller sizes, and even at larger sizes (for signage and display materials) the fonts typically wont have enough thickness to be easily read from a distance.</s><s> so if your logo calls for a script font, choose carefully or modify the font so as to make it easier to read.</s><s> thicken the paths, add a stroke or use the bold font style if available.</s><s> never do a script font in all caps (this applies to everything, not just logos).</s><s> its ugly and very difficult for the human eye to read, especially when you have but a moment to capture the readers attention.</s><s> if it looks jumbled or messy, the reader will just move on to something more appealing.</s><s> serif fonts offer a more versatility than script fonts.</s><s> they can be elegant or reserved, playful or traditional.</s><s> depending on the goal, i like using serif fonts in my logos.</s><s> you still have to be very mindful of reproduction issues.</s><s> shrink the font down, blow it up, and look at it from across the room to check that it is still legible from varying distances.</s><s> sans serif fonts are often a safe bet for logos.</s><s> fonts like helvetica, impact, gill sans and frutiger will generally reproduce well at all sizes.</s><s> the thing about sans serif fonts is that they often arent as visually expressive as serif or script fonts.</s><s> you have to cheat a bit to get them to show their inner character.</s><s> an easy way would be to kern them out and increase the spacing between the letters.</s><s> you can also play with case.</s><s> capitalize everything but leave only a particular letter as lowercase.</s><s> decrease or increase the horizontal scaling to make the font thinner or wider than it was intended to be.</s><s> just make sure that it isnt too bold or too thin so to ensure that the ink doesnt bleed together and create a huge blob instead of text, or so thin that enough ink doesnt stick to the page.</s><s> another consideration is font usage.</s><s> there are fonts that are extremely overused.</s><s> fonts like zapf chancery, brush script, comic sans, university and lucida usually come standard on most computers and/or are installed with common programs like word.</s><s> everybody has access to them and as such they find their way onto a whole range of projectsespecially logos.</s><s> be original.</s><s> be unique.</s><s> make your choice of font one of logic and design, not of convenience.

<s>logo design specifics: elements when you create a logo, you have an almost limitless array of options available.</s><s> the important thing to keep in mind is that a logo is a unique symbol of a company, and as such it must look unique.</s><s> dont fall prey to the pitfalls of repetitive elements.</s><s> repetitive elements are images like swooshes, stars and digital fades.</s><s> it seems that when anybody wants to make something look exciting, futuristic or technical they add one of these three elements.</s><s> be original people.</s><s> really dig deep and stretch the limits of your imagination.</s><s> a logo doesnt necessarily have to be a logical or literal interpretation of what a company does, produces or promotes.</s><s> this all goes back to doing your research and letting your newfound knowledge of the company fuel your creative juices.</s><s> another thing to consider is using a repetitive regional element.</s><s> for example, i live in colorado and we have a mountain called pikes peak.</s><s> many companies and individuals want to tie the mountains into their logo.</s><s> a good 80% of the local logos you see along the front range have a mountain of some sort intertwined within the image.</s><s> do you know how many ways there are to do mountains in a logo?</s><s> three.</s><s> you have the traditional snow capped triangle(s), the realistic detailed renditions (which never reproduce well at smaller sizes) and you have the stylized outline (which resembles a caterpillar with a calcium deficiency).</s><s> this particular element is so overused and so prevalent in local logo design that any logo that uses a mountain ends up looking like a hundred or thousand other logos.</s><s> i sure people in other parts of the world will easily identify with what im saying.</s><s> people in new york are probably sick of seeing logos with the statue of liberty, brooklyn bridge or empire state building in them.</s><s> people in paris probably see their share of logos with the eiffel tower and arc de triumph.</s><s> people in san francisco have probably had their fill of logos with the golden gate bridge or judy garland (sorry all, a cheap joke).</s><s> a companys location is not nearly as significant as the service it performs.</s><s> keep your focus on what matters, not what looks pretty, because i can guarantee that a hundred, less talented, less inspiring designers have probably already thought of and used the same thing long before you.

<subject>Peel Off White for Macs, AlphaWorks for Windows both Freeware</subject>
<post author="(Phos±four_dots)" timestamp="Feb 27, 2007 10:43 AM">
<s>originally posted by welles goodrich - 07:05am feb 27, 2007 pacific in the photoshop for windows forum for years i've been using peel off white on my mac.</s><s> it is an indispensable plugin.</s><s> here's the description...</s><s> "the peel off white filter is useful for silhouetting objects that you will later use in composite images by "lifting" them off of white, or light colored backgrounds.</s><s> if you apply the filter, then paint behind the pixels with white using the "behind" mode, you can create an opaque image with perfectly feathered edges that don't have that "clipping path" or "evenly feathered" look." http://www.bergdesign.com/plugins/ today i discovered a free plugin for windows which provides a similar result.</s><s> perhaps it goes further for you can peel off white or black and while it isn't as simple it works extremely well!</s><s> here's the description...</s><s> "alphaworks transparency effectsa single photoshop-compatible plug-in filter for quickly removing black or white values and making the region transparent.</s><s> there are 6 different options for you to choose from, depending on the type of image you are working on (colour photo, mono photo, lineart)." http://www.cybia.co.uk/alphaworks.htm (addendum by phos....</s><s>): it's worth noting that bergdesign also offers two other free plugins ( "gray to black" & "gray to white" ) whichwhen installed along with peel off whitewill offer macintosh users most of the same functionality as the alphaworks plugin.</s><s> that said, i find that both of these software authors have come up a little short in that they don't offer more complete information about what these plugins do and how they work, along with some tutorials and enough "before & after" examples to help you decide whether the plugins are right for the work you want to do.</s><s> cybia does host a user forum, but curiously there are no sub-sections dedicated to the use of their own software.</s><s> thanks again to welles goodrich for making the original post

<s>in the posts that follow you'll find links to color scheme generators and comparison charts, plus utilities and applications which can be used to explore the relationships between different colors in a variety of ways.</s><s> these can be useful for building color sets that will look good on your website or in print projects.</s><s> some work directly in your browser through either java, javascript or with a flash or shockwave plugin; others are applications or utilities that you download and use as separate programs or in conjunction with other programs.</s><s> depending on which site or application you choose, they will display the colors side-by-side and also show the codes for these colors in different formats, i.e.: rgb, hexadecimal, cmyk, lab, hsb, html named colors, etc. additionally, there are some which will create downloadable text files containing a list of the colors you choose, and others will even generate swatch files that you can save and which can be imported directly into your favorite applications.

<s>i referred to "html "named colors" above.</s><s> this refers to a list of 147 colors defined by the scalable vector graphics (svg) specification which use common language, such as red, blue, green, black, etc. when used as part of html/css/xml coding these real-language names are interpreted by browsers the same way as the rgb/hex code colors they represent.</s><s> so, instead of coding a color as "#00ffff" or using rgb values such as "0,255,255" you may simply type "aqua" and the proper color will be displayed when the code is rendered onscreen.</s><s> below are links to this list of named colors at a few sites: http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colornames.asp http://www.aumha.org/html/colorsb.htm see the following link for boatloads of more information on named colors and a vast tree of links.</s><s> there are many standards and systems for naming colors, and most of them aren't specific to being displayed by a web browser.</s><s> however, by cross-referencing and by doing a little work and calculation you should be able to come close to replicating named oil paint or house paint colors, for example, for use in a browser.</s><s> just keep in mind the differences between reflective and transmissive color, and remember that not all screen colors are printable, and not all print colors can be displayed onscreen. http://www.december.com/html/spec/colorspot.html

03:01pm feb 17, 2003 pacific (#92 of 113) well i just read through all 91 posts and have my own two cents to add.</s><s> this comes from more of a philosophical standpoint, but may be worth of consideration.</s><s> for the sake of brevity, i won't go into all of the sublties of possibilities, but i will qualify my position in what follows with this: i have been in sales and marketing for some of this countries top companies, i have taught professional salesmen how to sell (formal classes), and have a passion for the sales process.</s><s> that's a long winded way to say, i like to think that i know a bit about needs satisfaction selling - although, like a sushi chef, it takes a lifetime to master.</s><s> emma, pricing hourly or flat fee is often dependant on a lot of factors: the company (nike), the market, how much time you actually have.</s><s> when i started a consulting business years ago, everyone in the market charged hourly - from $75/hour to $200 per hour.</s><s> our strategy was to compete with them and make it really difficult for the client to compare apples to apples.</s><s> we chose to go flat fee for everything, and the way we sold it was based on this.</s><s> if you hire a stupid plumber, and it takes him longer to find and fix the problem you pay him more.</s><s> if you hire an idiot programmer who can't solve your problem right away, you pay him more.</s><s> does this make sense to you?</s><s> we structured all projects with defined end points.</s><s> this takes a lot of effort and conversation with the client.</s><s> i believe however, that setting expectations up front protects you the best.</s><s> we spent a lot of time in asking questions to the client.</s><s> don't ever forget: people don't care how much you know, until they know how much you care.</s><s> by asking questions, confirming processes, etc., you and the client engage in a way that demonstrates your prowess, and confers a great deal of confidence for them.</s><s> emma, don't ever sell yourself short.</s><s> what is easy for you is not easy for someone else.</s><s> that's why you pay so much money for a home - you could build one yourself much cheaper if you knew how.</s><s> that is to say, think about the project.</s><s> is it tough or easy?</s><s> will you have to spend a great deal of time going back and forth with the client?</s><s> build that into your price.</s><s> it's worth every penny.</s><s> if you are afraid they will feel gouged - stop it!</s><s> just don't gouge them, and justify your efforts.</s><s> not with hours - they could easily hire someone else for a cheap rate.</s><s> they can also drive a yugo as well, but they don't do they?</s><s> another caveat of pricing by the hour, is that you limit yourself to the amount of money you can make.</s><s> you only have 24 hours in a day and even if you could work all of them, you would still hit a cap.</s><s> sell your expertise.</s><s> a lot of design folks don't really like the selling process since they want to get right to what they do best: designing.</s><s> resist the temptation to shy away from conversation about the "what if's" of the project: i will charge you $500 to create your logo.</s><s> but here's your obligation - you will assign a project champion, the logo will be completed in 3 weeks, and you will have three concept proofs.</s><s> if we go beyond three, we will have to charge you $250 for the next set of three proofs.</s><s> the point of the above paragraph is to suggest that you must get client buy in.</s><s> they have to work with you, and if they go over their agreed upon endpoint, it will cost them money.</s><s> so many times i've seen people take on business for the cash, but in the end it isn't worth it.</s><s> charge enough so that you will provide every client with your absolute best work at every stage of the game.</s><s> ever get a job that looked good but after they started trying to cheat you or had "this little extra" to add on, that the job became not worth it at some level?</s><s> make sure that doesn't happen.</s><s> if you charge too little, you are under selling yourself period.</s><s> but there are compelling reasons to do it - like starting out.</s><s> but if you do charge on the low end, don't do it to be competative.</s><s> do it with the intention of asking the client for more business if they use your work.</s><s> something like: logos in this arena cost between $600 and $750 - for good ones.</s><s> i will charge you $500 for this job if you folks are willing to provide another job within the next couple of months - provided of course, that you like my work.</s><s> all of the above is a bit of free association to inspire you to think more creatively about selling yourself, little more.</s><s> i hope it helps some.</s><s> peace, tony post reply ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------- robert blackwell - 03:19pm feb 17, 2003 pacific (#93 of 113) it would be cool to archive some of the good threads here before they get expunged.</s><s> this is one and it's getting close to the edge.</s><s> maybe i can copy these posts to a text file or put em in my dbase and then have it on my website.</s><s> post reply ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------- lindas graphics -

<s>some advice from creativepro about "setting rates for your small design firm" which takes into consideration some of the everyday expenses many might forget: "when you're a freelancer, setting rates is relatively simple; you fill in a few cost numbers, find a comfortable profit margin (if you can), and divide the cost of business by the number of hours you want or need to work.</s><s> as a result, most freelancers have a single rate card." "setting rates is a bit more complicated when you're running a small design firm or managing a team with a wide variation in compensation and skill level." "when you're estimating rates for your firm, you also have to take into account a wide range of overhead costs, particularly if you're paying workers as bona fide employees rather than contractors.</s><s> this includes (as you may be painfully aware) the additional cost of insurance, fica, workers comp, vacation time, and sick time. http://www.creativepro.com/printerfriendly/story/24506.html

<s>>so would you charge him?</s><s> yes.</s><s> not charging is what the express lane to hell is paved with (good intentions only pave the scenic route). basically not charging is telling this person that you are willing to do small things for free, if you have ten customers who asume that and they all ask you to do a small thing, you have just lost 3 to 4 hours of billable time.</s><s> i charge an hourly rate and have a policy that i don't charge less than an hour.</s><s> this discourages people from bothering me for really trivial stuff ("can you send so and so this file cause i can't be bothered" type stuff) and if the customer is like yours sounds like, he'll be happy to pay it for what he wants (you don't have to tell him it took you less than an hour) since he can't do it him(her)self your work is worth something no matter how simple you think something is, if the customer doesn't know how to do it, it might as well be brain surgery as far as he's concerned.</s><s> for exanmple, i just charged a customer an hour for the following: retrieving a logo from my archives, removing a dash from it, adding the tm (trademark) symbol and e-mailing it to them.</s><s> did it take me an hour?</s><s> no. could the customer have done it himself?</s><s> perhaps, but he would have lost more of _his_ billable time than it cost him to come to me.

<s>em, since you're starting, here is a bit of info i would have appreciated when i starting regarding how much to bill for things: 1) time is money and money is time.</s><s> both are equivalent when freelancing.</s><s> 2) if the customer wants to pay a flat fee, estimate the amount of time it will take you and bill the flat fee acordingly, don't forget to add some extra time for unforeseen changes, problems etc... sometimes you will time on something so you don't have to spend money on it, and others, you're better off paying someone and saving yourself the time.</s><s> there is nothign wrong with charging someone for something someone else did and making a reasonable profit on it.</s><s> 4) how much to charge per hour?</s><s> while there is no magic number, here are thigns to consider: a) time is money and money is time(yes i know i said it before) you have to think in terms of "timoney" b) a simple way to calculate how much to charge is the following: 1- assume you will work 40 hours per week, 50 weeks per years, that's 2000 hours per year.</s><s> 2- take the amount of money you want to make in a year (say $40 000) 3- divide the money by the hours ($40 000/2000 = $20/hour) 4- do not bill $20 per hour, bill four times as much ($80) instead why?</s><s> because when you freelance, your customers must pay more than your timoney spent on their job, they have to pay for your computer, your software, your pantone chart etc...</s><s> they also have to pay for the timoney it took you to convince them to use you (everything from going to meeting, to business cards and promos falls in this category).</s><s> lastly, they have to pay for all the timoney you will spend running your business (you know, dealing with your accountant(or worse, the irs), billing, writing out those contracts, etc...</s><s> this is all called non-billable time and expenses.</s><s> it is reasonable to suppose that non-billable time and expenses are roughly three times as big as billable time and expenses, which is the only thing that brings in money.</s><s> it therefore has to generate enough money to pay you for everything.</s><s> thus you bill four times the hourly rate you wish to earn for yourself.</s><s> this is just a rule of thumb.</s><s> you can find other ways to calculate how much to bill and you may have to play with the numbers and the whole thing breaks down if you expect to make a million per year doing web design ;) but i've found it works out pretty well overall.

<s>[...</s><s>shadow/highlight workflow, continued...</s><s>] when i come upon an image that i can see would benefit from shadow / highlight, i let that notion dominate how i treat the image from the start.</s><s> i shoot raw with a canon 10d. the example we will examine is a tourist snapshot from trafalgar square, which i shot during an easter holiday.</s><s> now, the basic qualities of the shot is not the subject here.</s><s> by all means it has a fair share of photographic problems beyond this subject, but we'll use it for the purpose of this demonstration.</s><s> it was a typical overcast rainy day in london, and i could see that this image deserved a contrast treatment.</s><s> i could scuffle about in camera raw to try to get some contrast out of it, but instead i ignored all contrast enhancements in the raw developer, only making sure that white balance were fairly accurate.</s><s> all other settings were left on auto (possible exclusions to the auto rule is contrast and black point sliders, as these are contrast modifiers).</s><s> the rule of thumb is that all data must be comfortably inside the histogram, and less contrast is better than more contrast.</s><s> bypassing contrast enhancements also means setting the curve to linear, in order to maximise the data we can use later on.</s><s> i opened the photo in photoshop in 16-bit prophotorgb space.</s><s> this is the largest space camera raw allows me to open my photos in.</s><s> now, the first thing i want to do is to use s / h to increase the contrast of my image.</s><s> instead of launching the tool on a global basis, i much prefer to use a mask with the image, as this helps eliminate the halos created by s / h. this is easy to do.</s><s> i just use a luminosity mask, created by ctrl-clicking the composite rgb channel in the channel palette.</s><s> this will create a selection based on the brightness in the image.</s><s> that is, the lighter parts are more selected than the darker parts.</s><s> this pre-operation is in itself a zone mapper of sorts.</s><s> it will mean that whatever you do in s / h, you will have to keep in mind that the lighter parts will be much more effected than the darker parts.</s><s> shadows/highlights dialogue next, i launch s / h and experiment with the settings.</s><s> immediately i discover that the sky is brightened, not darkened.</s><s> this is due to the clipping settings, as my image histogram does not reach all the way to the right.</s><s> this is ok, though; i want to end up with a maximized histogram.</s><s> i start out setting the default shadow amount to 0, instead tweaking the highlight slider, keeping the tonal width at the default 50%.</s><s> as the sky was lightened by the highlight clipping, it takes a drastic amount to get the sky down to the level i want it.</s><s> to avoid halos, the radius is set at 90, which i find to be a reasonable setting for a 6mp image (70-120).</s><s> the combination of contrast introduced cia clipping settings and the highlight suppresion slider leaves me with a much more dramatic, contrasty sky.</s><s> the fountain really pops out against the sky now, compared to before.</s><s> next, i set the shadow amount to a reasonable setting.</s><s> this also takes a drastic measure, as we are using a selection based on lighter parts.</s><s> radius again set to 90.</s><s> finally, i increase the color correction slider to a massive +60.</s><s> as we are in 16-bit prophotorgb space, the dull and lifeless image can easily take the color injection.</s><s> i left midtone contrast to 0.</s><s> i still find that i can control midtone contrast better with a curve adjustment later on if i wish.</s><s> i then apply the correction.</s><s> [continued, below...</s><s>]

<s>  here's the "before" image (straight out of acr) and the "after" image, after s / h exiting my selection, a final tweak involves a final levels or curves adjustment to get perfect contrast and clipping.</s><s> my usual workflow involves a global smart sharpening at this stage, before converting down to my final or archival destination space and bit depth.</s><s> i forgot to mention that i do not apply sharpening in my raw developer (leave it at 0).</s><s> here are some pitfalls to be aware of when using this tool: 1) dont overdo it.</s><s> as an imaging pro, i can always tell when shadow highlight has been overused, or used badly.</s><s> this is especially obvious when it is (over-)used on an 8-bit image.</s><s> if you want to seriously expand your image dr, investigate other options, such as developing several versions of your raw image and merge them later, or merge to hdr.</s><s> 2) avoid halos.</s><s> at all cost.</s><s> simply do not accept visible halos.</s><s> a luminosity mask helps a lot.</s><s> 3) use s / h in 16-bit prophotorgb space for highest quality results.</s><s> i hope you found this tip helpful.</s><s> your comments and tips are welcome in the original thread where this was posted .

<s>vectorize - a quick tutorial   mathias vejerslev - 10:04am apr 14, 2004 pacific there's pixels, and then there's vectors.</s><s> since photoshop 6, photoshop sports increasingly advanced vector tools which often eliminates or at least delays the trip to illustrator for vectors.</s><s> we use vectors when designing logos or creating graphic artwork.</s><s> in print and in applications such as flash.</s><s> i have made a tool (photoshop action) for easy vector conversion of any pixel content (high res line art scan, pencil drawing, photo, or even web graphic), directly in photoshop, with options to: choose blur value to simplify choose threshold level fine tune with a dodging and burning layer (this is the trick with continuous tone images) set path tolerance make a custom shape export result to illustrator the technique included is very powerful indeed, albeit simple in idea.</s><s> from this ugly jpeg comes this nice vector shape another example a third example ever needed to enlarge a small photo to poster size without quality loss?</s><s> ever needed to convert a web size .gif to use as a catalog backdrop?</s><s> ever needed a ultra fast way of cleaning up your artwork or sketches to highest quality output?</s><s> ever needed to convert pixels to vectors?</s><s> you can download and study the technique from here: http://www.96ppi.net/ddt_vectorizer.zip (un-zip action and load from photoshop).</s><s> mathias & pierre.</s><s> previous tutorials: phosphor "haloless sharpening - a quick tutorial" 2/20/04 11:03pm phosphor "controlling contrast - a quick tutorial" 2/20/04 11:03pm

<s>haloless sharpening - a quick tutorial   originally posted by mathias vejerslev - 08:46am jan 23, 2004 pacific i was writing this up for a friend somewhere else, and thought i might as well post it here for those that are not aware.</s><s> advanced layer blending in photoshop can be used for a great many things.</s><s> amongst those are halo less sharpening.</s><s> i think i became aware of alb about two years ago, and i have used it since in many different techniques.</s><s> here's how to reduce halos when sharpening (its a quick example, mind you): the lower of the three is unsharpened.</s><s> i duplicated that layer, and obscenely oversharpened with usm (middle).</s><s> then i right-clicked that layer, and set the blending options like this: which resulted in what you see on top (still a little too sharp, but you can simply reduce the opacity of the layer to taste).</s><s> you do this by alt-dragging the triangle sliders to create a semi-transparent blend of the extreme whites and extreme blacks, in order to emphasize the midtones of the current layer.</s><s> you can quickly determine how far you must go by simply dragging the endpoints to where the annoying halos dissappear, then split the endpoint to this position to blend it.</s><s> you can use this technique with other layer based sharpening techniques such as high pass sharpening and others with great effect, as you can sharpen much more without visible halos.</s><s> this is a variation dubbed midtone sharpening.</s><s> enjoy mathias

<subject>Controlling Contrast - A Quick Tutorial by Mathias Vejerslev</subject>
<post author="(Phos±four_dots)" timestamp="Feb 20, 2004 6:23 AM">
<s>controlling contrast - a quick tutorial   originally posted by mathias vejerslev - 03:27pm jan 29, 2004 pacific managing the contrast in a photograph must be one of the most important tasks in post processing.</s><s> these are just a few quick tips for the workflow of contrast enhancements.</s><s> at minimum, levels or curves or perhaps both, are applied.</s><s> we should get used to use adjustment layers instead of 'hard-copy' adjustments.</s><s> a quick way of determining shadow and highlight burnouts in the levels dialog is to alt-drag the levels end point sliders.</s><s> the preview will clearly show when burnouts or blow-outs appear, even in which color.</s><s> users of curves should be alerted that the curves interface can be enlarged via a small icon in the lower right of the curves interface.</s><s> this allows more precise control when applying curve points.</s><s> you can identify and define your shade on the curve directly in the image (one click in the image to preview, one ctrl-click to apply point to curve), then you can use the arrow keys to tweak the curve point, shift-arrow for 10x movement.</s><s> the arrow keys can be used for many of photoshop dialog screens with much efficiency and accuracy, although not all filters are equally optimized for them.</s><s> one of photoshops few features that i never personally use is the brightness/contrast adjustment.</s><s> many professionals agree that there are smarter way of controlling these factors than a pure linear approach.</s><s> here are two techniques broadly used amongst photo professionals, these are 'the old school of contrast': 1) increasing contrast with usm duplicate layer filter>sharpen>usm settings for web sized image: 1-20, 50, 0 settings for larger photos: 1-20, 70, 0 adjust duplicate layer blending to your liking i call this method 'contrast coating'.</s><s> it can create a subtle contrast enhancement such as you know from very expensive camera lenses.</s><s> 2) decreasing contrast with contrast masking duplicate layer image>adjust>desaturate image>adjust>invert set image blend mode: overlay or soft light filter>blur>gaussian blur: you can either choose a very low blur or a very large blur (0.3 or 30+ radius), if you choose a low blur radius, then you must decrease the layer opacity to a very low level (which is what i did in the example below).</s><s> if you choose a large radius, you must control the halo effect to a minimum.contrast masking can even be used as a 'fill flash' effect to rescue over-contrasty or backlit photos.</s><s> {below is an animated gif] of these two effects, when aggressively applied to a neutral image of a domestic animal: i should note that there are effects to the colors of the image with both methods, but i had to restrict my palette to 256 shades to use an animated gif, and the effect is better experienced first hand.in both of these recipes, you are left with a layer that you can blend and mask any way you like, so you can easily combine the two effects in an image, say to lift shadows, but increase highlight/midtone contrast if you like.</s><s> mathias

<s>would you like to create a text logo, some contact information, or perhaps a copyright notice that you can use over and over, at various sizes?</s><s> here's how...</s><s> first of all, dispel all notions of rasterizing your text for this tip.</s><s> if you do that, you'll only ever be able to properly use the result at the size you created it.</s><s> changing the size of the rasterized text will make it fuzzy, because you'll be transforming pixels.</s><s> you're looking for a way to keep these layers as vector, correct?</s><s> here's one way: let's go with an example of three text layers.</s><s> and let's assume they're named "one", "two" and "three." highlight text layer "one" in the layers palette.</s><s> go to "layer---"type---"create work path".</s><s> this creates a vector path of your type in the paths palette.</s><s> this path and its name is temporary until you create another work path, but if you create a second work path youll overwrite your first path.</s><s> you want to make each path a permanent part of your document.</s><s> go to your paths palette and double-click on work path.</s><s> this will give you the option to name the path so you don't overwrite it.</s><s> click "ok".</s><s> the default name of "path 1" is fine for now.</s><s> back in the layers palette, highlight text layer "two" and repeat the steps above.</s><s> do the same with text layer "three." in your paths palette, you should now see: path 1 path 2 path 3 these are the path versions of the text layers.</s><s> so far, pretty easy, right?</s><s> now to combine the paths.</s><s> choose the direct selection tool (keyboard "a") in your paths palette, (option+click) [alt+click] on "path 3." this will select the entire path and all the anchor points.</s><s> copy the paths for "path 3" (command+c) [ctrl+c].</s><s> click on "path 1" to highlight it.</s><s> paste the path you just copied (command+v) [ctrl+v].</s><s> "path 1" now consists of the path from text layer "one" and the path from text layer "three."

"path 1" now consists of the paths you created from all 3 text layers.</s><s> now, you have the vector paths for all three text layers gathered together in "path 1." you can drag "path 2" and "path 3" to the trash if you want.</s><s> (option+click) [alt+click] on "path 1" and you'll see that all three text layer paths will be selected.</s><s> youll know, because all of the anchor points on all of the paths will be darkened.</s><s> go to "edit---"define custom shape..." and name it how you wish.</s><s> your new custom shape will now be present in your custom shape menu.</s><s> wanna save it out so you don't lose it?</s><s> go to "edit---"preset manager..." choose "custom shapes" (command+7) [ctrl+7] in the drop-down menu.</s><s> your new 3-text-layer-custom-shape will appear at the end of the list.</s><s> click once on its name (or icon, if you're viewing that way).</s><s> click on the "save set..." button.</s><s> choose a name, and save it somewhere you wont lose it.</s><s> the "custom shapes" folder, inside the "presets" folder, inside the main photoshop folder is a good place.

<s>matt, this is too funny (at least for me)--i just printed out this thread to add to my other blu logo file of important wisdom---and i was relating to katie's post about "deciphering the colloquialism" that was also lost on a "naive california girl"---i wasn't even sure what katie meant by "w@anker".</s><s> so as i'm deciding that since it doesn't refer to a photoshop technique, that i just shouldn't worry "my pretty little head about it" (heh heh)--you post your message.</s><s> i don't really vision blu being tied up with jelly and body parts, so, i look forward to the translation as well.</s><s> thanks for asking first katie--- patty
