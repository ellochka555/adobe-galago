<s>this is a user-to-user forum.</s><s> unless you see employee under a screen name, you should assume the poster is an unpaid volunteer.</s><s> everyone's time is valuable, including yours.</s><s> the following tips will help you get answers more quickly: 
do give your post a meaningful subject line, indicating of the nature of the problem.</s><s> give sufficient details (such as operating system, browser, hardware platform, and other relevant information) for others to understand the nature of the problem, but don't go overboard.</s><s> short, focused questions tend to get answered more quickly.</s><s> if your problem concerns a web page that doesn't display as expected, upload the page to a public website and give the url.</s><s> but don't post links to anything you don't want indexed by a search engine.</s><s> create a test folder on the site, and remove the page when the problem has been solved.</s><s> give details of any error messages.</s><s> say briefly what you have done to try to solve the problem yourself.</s><s> if your question involves a database or server-side technology, such as php, coldfusion, or asp, say which one, and include it in the subject line. 
</s><s>don't don't post a series of questions in a single post.</s><s> splitting them into separate threads increases your chances of a quick answer.</s><s> don't repeat the same question in different forums, as this makes it harder for both you and those trying to help you to keep track of progress.</s><s> duplicate posts will be deleted.</s><s> when someone has answered your question, don't start asking more questions in the same thread.</s><s> keeping threads separate with clear subject lines makes it easier for others who might have the same problem to find the information they need.</s><s> don't be impatient.</s><s> if you don't get an answer in 24 hours, post a follow-up question in the same thread, asking if you need to give more details.</s><s> the lack of replies might also indicate that no one else knows the answer.</s><s> don't hijack existing topics by replying with unrelated questions or suggestions.</s><s> start a new discussion thread so your question stands out.

<s>thank you to everyone who participated in our forum reskin private beta.</s><s> we received a lot of very helpful feedback that went a long way in helping us really understand what is most valuable and important to all of our members. 
</s><s>the adobe forums have not had a major design update since we originally launched on the jive platform back in 2009.</s><s> however, with the launch of adobe creative suite 6 and the adobe creative cloud, we expect that the adobe forums will become an even more essential resource for the entire adobe community. 
</s><s>in fact, one of the major design goals was to create a more integrated user experience between the creative cloud, adobe.com, and the forums.</s><s> some of the major changes include: dramatically simplified global navigation more consistent sign-in/sign-out experience common ui elements and interface conventions, including shared fonts (adobe clean served via typekit) and color palettes.</s><s> in fact, both the creative cloud and adobe forums now use a dark-grey right-hand navigation panel where all of the tools/actions are aligned (just like in our desktop apps).</s><s> streamlined interface, pared clean of cluttered icons and redundant options - so you can really focus on the content that you care most about.</s><s> and finally, an optimized layout designed to cultivate the true heart and soul of the forums experience: community q&a. 
</s><s>this last goal, in particular, is the most exciting for all of us on the adobe team – we understand that in a true community of experts, help is not a document.</s><s> it's a conversation.</s><s> that conversation starts here – in this forum with this community.</s><s> and the whole team here at adobe, from design to engineering, honors that simple idea and we hope to share more exciting news with you over the coming months as we explore fresh ways to create connections, conversations, and content. 
</s><s>and yes, we know -- the new theme is still not 100% perfect so please continue to report bugs in the known issues thread.</s><s> the team is listening and we will be responding quickly with new patches and bug fixes on a regular basis.</s><s> in the meanwhile, we look forward to many, many great conversations to come!

<s>john, 
</s><s>for the previous "update," i was involved in the beta.</s><s> maybe my being in the uk for a couple of weeks negated my contributions to this update.</s><s> sorry that i missed it, as i would have had volumes of contributions, and pleased to either make changes, or to not do some things. 
i have lived through many changes to the adobe forums, going back to the nntp days, and this might be the worst, that i have experienced. 
</s><s>as things seem to be changing by the hour, after the ~ 2 hour shutdown, i will reserve my final comments, but each hour seems to make thing worse. 
</s><s>after a decade (actually longer) of work in the adobe forums, this is a bad move, at least imho.

<s>in order to be helpful and not just complain, there's three specific things i don't like about the new skin. 
</s><s>first, there's no 'box' around the original post.</s><s> it just hangs out there with the rest of the background.</s><s> i don't like that.</s><s> every post should have some sort of 'box' within which it appears. 
</s><s>second, the original post used to be in blue, very distinguishable from the replies.</s><s> subsequent posts from that op were also in blue, again to distinguish it.</s><s> others' posts appeared with a white background, and my own appeared with a gray background.</s><s> now, everyone's post has the same plain grey background.</s><s> that makes it more difficult to go back and look over what i've previously written, and more difficult to cull out posts from the op in a thread.</s><s> changes should make things better, not worse.</s><s> this current scheme is worse.

<s>dear madam / sir, i take this opportunity to draw your attention that, i am not able to sign up my personal account on adobe.com.</s><s> the reason is that kosovo is not listed as country nor integrated.</s><s> as you might be aware, kosovo is a new country so far recognized as independent by the majority of members of the united nations, including the united states,canada, united kingdom, netherland, germany,france,italy,belgium and the majority of european union countries.</s><s> kosovo has also become a member of intergovernmental bodies including the world bank and imf.</s><s> leading internet properties such as facebook, dropbox, linkedin, w3c and twitter have now added kosovo to their menus.</s><s> legally, kosovo had its independence confirmed by the international court of justice (icj).</s><s> the icj on 22 of july 2010 concluded on its decision "that the adoption of the declaration of independence of 17 february 2008 did not violate general international law, security council resolution 1244 (1999) or the constitutional framework.</s><s> consequently the adoption of that declaration did not violate any applicable rule of international law." (see para.</s><s> 122 of the court's decision: http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/141/15987.pdf).</s><s> the unambiguous wording of the icj, a principle organ of the united nations, is the primary reference when considering any issue with regard to kosovo's statehood and its place in international relations.</s><s> kosovo has one of the youngest populations in all of europe.</s><s> kosovo, as a young country, is rapidly bridging the digital divide facing its citizens, institutions and businesses.</s><s> today, 76% of kosovo households have a broadband internet connection.</s><s> our youth are leading the rapid spread of the use of all forms of digital media.</s><s> it would serve your website to understand the size of your users in kosovo.</s><s> we are keen internet users.</s><s> adding kosovo to your menus would help us to inform you precisely about our location.</s><s> your supportive response would help us to overcome a technological barrier that affects internet users from kosovo attempting to utilize adobe.com experience.</s><s> on behalf of myself and the kosovo users that are playing with different country flags, i would like to thank you in advance for taking action on our behalf.</s><s> yours sincerely,   jonas andersson

you download and install any particular program once... and then you pay monthly (or, maybe, an annual payment) and you only have to be connected at intervals to verify you are still there (for details go to http://forums.adobe.com/community/creative_cloud or http://forums.adobe.com/community/creative_cloud/creative_cloud_connec tion forums)

<s>for any lingering doubts about internet connection, the official position is this: 
</s><s>"an internet connection is required the first time you install and license your desktop apps, but you can use the apps in offline mode with a valid software license.</s><s> the desktop apps will attempt to validate your software licenses every 30 days. 
</s><s>for annual members, you can use the apps for up to 99 days in offline mode.</s><s> month-to-month members can use the software for up to 30 days in offline mode.</s><s> " 
</s><s>so it seems that you can take out an annual plan and have 99 days trouble free without internet connection.</s><s> also, i understand that if within this 99 day period you happen to have an internet connection then the clock starts again.</s><s> you get another 99 days after the first connection and this goes on and on. 
i am not a fan of creative cloud and i don't have any plans to have this yet because i am quite happy with cs6 (perpetual license) for now and i guess that should serve my needs for the next 18 months.</s><s> after that, we might have something else to replace adobe. 
</s><s>if any of you have any plans about these products then why not contact microsoft or corel and tell them how they can improve their products.</s><s> before you start about linux and macs, please note that both microsoft and corel are windows based products so anything about "nix" or macs won't help here.

<s>true you dont need much internet to verify your cc subscription but that is not our concern. 
i think what phillip and i mean is different than what you think we mean.</s><s> we mean that you will need to download updates/upgrades or if you decide to download a program you have not put on your computer yet and dont forget their cloud storage and collaboration.</s><s> now im no expert so i will relate it to what i know.</s><s> i used to be big into online gaming.</s><s> the particular game im referring to is league of legends.</s><s> they do updates about 1-4 times a month.</s><s> some are very minor and only tweeks and bug fixes that are about 10-50mb as i suspect they have the replace the whole files not just subfiles, no big deal.</s><s> probably every 1-4 months they do a big update or upgrade and that could be 50-500mb.</s><s> ive literally seen the updates this big and every one trying to download at the same time and even with a decent computer and internet take over 6 hours!</s><s> with said game and my same lap top (few years old) i would get about 25 frames/sec at library or apartment and at my wife's family with the best internet available there would get only 15 frames/sec which in game terms in unusable.</s><s> so the internet was about 1/2 the speed of even public library's and my home internet.</s><s> that is very sad.</s><s> last month was the newest release of the iphone operating system.</s><s> i dont have but about 1/2 the students in my class had it.</s><s> with everyone trying to download it at once the servers they were getting if from were slowed and what would have taken 30-60minutes was streched out to for some 4+ hours!</s><s> as it was it was better to wait the next day.</s><s> i suspect if every adobe customer was on crazy cloud there would again be a rush for everyone in the world to download it and dramatically slow the speed down and all the while you cant used said program being updated. 
</s><s>if every few weeks/months adobe cc has updates and the more programs you have the more chance of an update for what you have and more chance of more updates total.</s><s> ok so it could even with decent computer and internet take hours to update/upgrade all your cc software.</s><s> true you could do it say at night when you go to bed or leave work but lets say you have a tight dead line and cant let it update for the next few hours.</s><s> also consider that i honestly dont like the computer downloading for hours at a time when im not around to check on its progress incase the download stops for some reason and has to be restarted or the internet as is possible in my aparments crash for a few minutes every day and also just to be causious.</s><s> any professional will tell you that some times you may not sleep for 3 days because of a dead lines and you cant fiddle with updates preventing you from using your tools while its downloading and then maybe having to restart your computer.</s><s> also with tools you know well the last thing you want is a sudden unexpected change.</s><s> such as in cs 5 or 6 they changed in illustrator how life trace worked and where it was located.</s><s> i did not need it but was just poking around and could not find it.</s><s> i could not find it for about 1 week when an other student saw my frustration and pointed out where they had moved it to.</s><s> if i had a dead line then and needed life trace/paint i would have been sunk.</s><s> so having tools and things suddendly change maybe very few months to new locations or chaning the fundamentals of how they would could be a nightmare.</s><s> the horror of constantly needing to investigate ever update to see if it will mess up your workflow. 
</s><s>im warry of new things, especially for technology as it often is first released with many bugs and issues.</s><s> i would probably refuse the updates until the next set of updates come about to avoid such problems.</s><s> i generally avoid new technology that is only 1 year old for this.</s><s> i wait for them to fix the problems then i might be interested.</s><s> as such this would put me maybe 4-8 months behind the cc upgrades and honestly if i can live 8 months behind i can live 12 months and if 12 why not 18 and it 18 why not 24?</s><s> at which point it would be better to just have the traditional upgrade cycle.</s><s> also the upgrades even from 1 full edition to the next are generally small.</s><s> so the upgrades for 1/4 and edition ever 6 months would probably be useless.</s><s> also dont forget that because they are not putting them on cd they can over rely on the fact that if there issues we can just make a patch instead of really hammering it out for upto 18 months each new thing to get all the bugs out. cc will probably see many ither 1/2 baked updates or see only 1/2 as many new things as traditionaly as cash cow has a subscription income which gives much less incentive to inovate.</s><s> what is an angry customer going to do, leave cc?</s><s> probably not if they have been with it for a few years as aobe now is holding hostage your files. 
</s><s>adobe cut off the escapte route and combined with a subscripton gives them very little reason to press for good inovation any more.

<s>thanks, nigel, for thinking about the situation before throwing such advice as "don't use the forums" or "create your own".</s><s> the lack of supervision is just one of the aspects i habe been asking to be improved.</s><s> as far as i can remember been told by people in the know nearly two years ago, the forums in spanish were created as a service for a small group of spanish speaking users in some central american country.</s><s> when i discovered them almost by chance, i found a site with very bad translations of the original english text in some places, and no translations at all in others, and that was hardly used at all because it was not known or publicized.</s><s> when trying to find what could be done to improve the site, i was offered the chance of collaborating with the person in charge.</s><s> after trying to get in touch with that person for a couple of months (i never did), it turned out that that person wasn't really in charge, that he didn't know or use adobe products, that he was an extremely busy man in his country, and had only offered to collaborate in this as a personal favour to someone with some influence here, but wasn't really interested in the matter.</s><s> i then turned to jc, who had also offered to help in improving the forums in spanish.</s><s> his response was very efficient as usual, and we slowly but steadily introduced important changes in the site, which make it much more easier to use now than when i discovered it.</s><s> apparently, when the site improved, adobe spain began publicising it on its site, and the number of visitors began to increase considerably.</s><s> i understand that in the meantime the french and german forums were created, both in a much better shape that the original spanish one i knew.</s><s> i also understand that in middle 2004, some still undisclosed european branch of adobe took at least the french and spanish forums officially in charge -just by looking at the main page of the german ones, i would guess they were luckier.</s><s> everything was stopped then; no more changes.</s><s> i had just sent jc a proposition for a new, less cluttered, more rational entry page that included a link to instructions for newcomers, that he sent to the new authorities.</s><s> i understand that even him doesn't know if my proposition has been read.</s><s> it is true that in these many months, jc and i have introduced some very minor changes here and there, but his hands are tied and we can do no more than that.</s><s> frome some things jc has told me, i understand that at least some pages in the spanish forums use very old templates, which would explain the lack of some functionalities that are present in all the other forums.</s><s> for example, there is no "subscribe to this discussion by email" button at the bottom of the new message box.</s><s> so what am i asking for?</s><s> first of all, i am not asking for any "right"; i think that pierre's phrase there was unfortunate, as it gave people who don't try to understand the problem, who have nothing constructive to offer, and that in my opinion should take their witty remarks elsewhere, a chance to continue ridiculizing a situation that obviously doesn't affect them and doesn't even interest them.</s><s> perhaps i could sumarize my requests like this.</s><s> if that unnamed adobe branch doesn't have the funds, the will, or the intention of doing something to improve the forums in spanish, why not just leave jc, with the aid of people like me, to at least make the site functional, and have all the pages written in proper spanish?</s><s> in my opinion, doing nothing in fourteen months, preventing anything to be done, and simply ignoring the free help that is been offered is not a wise course of action.</s><s> plus, of course, >adobe have created forums for use but without supervision.</s><s> you only have to look at the mud-slinging that occasionally goes on in the lower depths of the english-speaking forums to realise that this is a recipe for disaster.
