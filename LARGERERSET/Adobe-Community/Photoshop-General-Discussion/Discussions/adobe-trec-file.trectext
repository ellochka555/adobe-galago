<s>adobe writes to restore preferences quickly using a keyboard short cut: 
press and hold alt+control+shift (windows) or option+command+shift (mac os) as you start photoshop.</s><s> you are prompted to delete the current settings.</s><s> the new preferences files are created the next time you start photoshop.</s><s> note: using the keyboard shortcut, preference files for custom shortcuts, workspaces, and color settings will also be reset to default. 
</s><s>however if you use windows and double click on desktop icon to start photoshop you need to do that then quickly press and hold alt+control+shift (windows).</s><s> if your not prompted to delete you missed the reset startup window.</s><s> if your holding down alt+control+shift (windows) and double click a desktop icon the shortcut icon's property window will open not photoshop. 
</s><s>adobe writes troubleshoot installed optional and third-party plug-ins 
to quickly determine whether photoshop is loading a problematic optional or third-party plug-ins, do the following: close photoshop.</s><s> hold down the shift key and launch photoshop.</s><s> a dialog will appear during launch that reads "skip loading optional and third-party plug-ins?" click yes to skip loading optional and third-party plug-ins.</s><s> note: this only disables optional and third-party for the current session.</s><s> if you quit and restart photoshop without holding down the shift key, the optional or third-party plug-ins will be enabled. 
</s><s>so f2 is not needed only the shift is needed to get the prompt. 
</s><s>cs6 does start differently when ctrl is held down on my windows 7 machine.</s><s> i see the normal cs6 splash screen on my desktop as usually for a while then a black window with white border appears below the splash screen that windows closes then the phototoshop desktop window opens on top and the splash window is closed. 
i can not find any documentation on the ctrl key startup process adobe's documentation is not the best.</s><s> also holding the alt key seems to work the same was as the ctrl key. 
</s><s>holding ctrl+alt produces an additional popup window where you change you scratch disks preferences.</s><s> adobe documentation is not the best also happens with cc 
ctrl+shift produces a browse for folder dialog with cs6 but not with cc

<s>first try logging out of the cc desktop app using its preferences / accounts area, then reboot, then log back in to the cc desktop app. 
</s><s>if that doesn't work, try uninstalling and re-installing the creative cloud app, first, and then if that doesn't work, photoshop cc, from: 
https://creative.adobe.com/products 
it's not clear why a cc product would be asking for a serial number unless something is corrupted in the licensing objects on your computer and there is not an obvious way to reset those.</s><s> cc is licensed by logging into the cc desktop app, but i think there is a serial number stored internally so they can track your specific license, so maybe that is no longer stored and so it's asking for a new one. 
</s><s>post your question over in the adobe creative cloud forum.</s><s> there are adobe support people who seem to read and reply to messages over there when related to activation issues although i'm not sure how many of them are on during the weekend, and it seems like there are more of them late sunday evening (us time) when its monday morning in india:

1) open new document.</s><s> 2) draw normally with mouse.</s><s> 3) switch to tablet and draw normally.</s><s> 4) switch to mouse, draw normally on the first input.</s><s> 5) input or draw something else on the second try and it starts lagging.

<s>yeah i'm not sure exaclty how it works under the hood but since the behavior only occurs when acting on a live photoshop cc document and not in other painting or system applications i guessed that photoshop, win8 and the wacom driver were having some sort of dissagreement about how to handle the input.</s><s> feels like some sort of collision related to "mousedown" since dragging behavior is fine.

<s>are you suggesting that the lag someone experiences using a mouse to draw a vector path on a 100k jpeg that mysteriously goes away when they use their wacom tablet instead of the mouse, in photoshop cs6, on a machine with 64gb of ram, of which 32gb is assigned to photoshop (that also has its own 256gb striped raided ssd swap file); is not in fact an issue with the compatibility of the drivers provided by wacom and the built-in support for tablets in photoshop; but rather an issue of the pagefile in windows not being large enough to handle the vastly massive overhead required to draw the vector path on such a tiny image; and adobe's official suggestion is that i add a 256gb pagefile to windows? Ê sounds ridiculous when you look at it.</s><s> my peak commit charge with a 930mb photoshop file open during a reduction in size of said photoshop file from 13200px x 13700px to 1200px x 1200px is 9.34gb (that's 13.94% of my installed ram).</s><s> suggesting that i add a 256gb pagefile to my system to rectify an issue that showed up in photoshop cs6 (because it doesn't happen in cs5.5) is incorrect. Ê for the record according to the people who made windows (where i got my information): Ê the 64-bit versions of windows can support more ram than the 32-bit versions of these products.</s><s> when a lot of memory is added to a computer, a paging file may not be required.</s><s> they still recommend that you use one, so you can go through the memory dumps when an app like firefox loads adobe flash player and pages out of memory due to poor programming though.</s><s> luckily i've not had this same experience with adobe photoshop and because i'm using a server motherboard with ecc ram i've not had bluescreens either.

<s>back on our original topic for a moment, please let's not forget that wacom should also have a look into this issue.</s><s> i strongly encourage you to post also at the wacom forums regarding this bug. 
i can't find the link to the usa forums since i'm in europe and when going to wacom.com and clicking product support > forum, i get instantly redirected to the wacom.eu site, but for what it's worth, here is the thread i opened at the intuos forum: 
http://forum.wacom.eu/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=15969 
this issue could be adobe's fault, yes, but it might also be wacom's (in fact, since they do the driver, they should be the ones to pinpoint the problem at least).</s><s> wacom support staff seems pretty responsive, but so far, afaik, it's just the two of us (ook_22 and me) complaining about this specific issue at wacom's site! 
</s><s>so please make sure to make yourselves heard on wacom's forum too (it takes a minute to create a user, i know it's always a nuisance, but putting up with this mouse lag is worse in the medium and long run... and i don't know about you, but i plan on keeping on using photoshop cc for a very long time). 
i guess complaining to wacom is the best way in order to get a solution for this problem.</s><s> thank you!</s><s>

<s>even with lots of ram, you can save a lot of that ram using a paging file.</s><s> i agree.</s><s> on the speed, having a pagefile is slower (ms vs ns) than doing everything in memory.</s><s> it does take longer to initially start the machine and load everything with the pagefile turned off (windows sort of loses its head when things aren't configured as expected), but the system was much more responsive in my case (with it off) once i had all of my apps loaded... all with the exception of the vector path tool (every once in a while) in photoshop.</s><s> i've also disabled caching, prefetch, writebehind caching and a lot of the background tasks because i'm not concerned with the perception of speed in windows, only with performance during renders (lightwave, modo, premiere).</s><s> i'm also running a significantly paired down install compared to what comes out of the box, so i'm not running the average machine (custom build and custom install).</s><s> the lack of a paging file can reduce performance on the system - but usually that performance loss occurs when loading applications.</s><s> right.</s><s> and this is good advice... do not disable your pagefile people.</s><s> i forgot this was in the context of general advice because someone will read my post and think...</s><s> "hey that sounds like a good idea." then hose their machine.</s><s> even though your response about the pagefile was off of my original point (about it being a driver conflict in regard to the wacom tablet) it did help me, because i had built the machine as a workstation and used it that way for several years, but have used it largely as a server (server motherboard and all) for a couple of weeks after i got my mac and had forgotten i had disabled the pagefile.</s><s> enabling the pagefile definitely helps with serving the larger files and everything else related to the background tasks involved.</s><s> also i've switch the settings on that machine to priority for background tasks as well.</s><s> back on topic (didn't mean to appear to hijack the thread) the glitch with the path tool existed before i turned off my pagefile though, i didn't disable the pagefile until earlier this year when i trying to squeeze more performance out of my machine (before upgrading and buying a mac).</s><s> i do not experience the same issues with the path tool on the mac.</s><s> love photoshop by the way.</s><s> thanks chris!</s><s>

<s>autohotkey's capability seems unlimited.</s><s> it lets you do things way above and beyond what photoshop's default capabilities are. 
</s><s>the script posted above does indeed work as i use it regularly.</s><s> ahk isn't without flaws though, there are glitches on occasion.</s><s> whether that has anything to do with ahk or the always-changing windows environment it's running under is another question. 
</s><s>you can assign unlimited functions to your right button, your middle button, your forward and back buttons... and to any key on the keyboard, and thats just for starters. 
</s><s>so in other words, your middle pen button can be set to pan your image in photoshop, but at the same time it can also rotate the canvas, switch tools, run .jsx scripts - it overcomes the limitations of wacom's driver software (ie. middle button = pan/scroll only) so in other words middle button can do 10 different things whenever you want it to.</s><s> press it once to pan, press it twice to rotate, etc... or hold it down for 1 second to run a .jsx script, hold it down for two seconds to select the eraser tool, hold it down for 3 seconds to switch to fullscreen mode...and so on... it's unlimited.

<s>hi again 
firstly, thank-you very much for taking the time to respond to my question.</s><s> its great to have such a supportive community behind photoshop.

</s><s>unfortunately i lose pen pressure control after using it - until i lift and reapply the pen - as it initiates a standard left-click which isnt operating through the wacom pen drivers. 
</s><s>it is also recognized by photoshop as a second stroke in the sense of opacity buildup, which is undesired.

</s><s>the only way i can think of to actually turn the street lights off with photoshop, is to take a photograph of the city official in charge of that sort of thing, and composite him/her into a compromising situation.</s><s> i feel they would turn those lights off for you to avoid a scandal. 
</s><s>to photoshop away the lights, look for another image with cars in a low light situation, but with their lights off, and either composite the front of the car onto your picture, or use it as a guide to paint out the lights free hand.</s><s> i'd use a combination of both.</s><s> the lights flare beyond the normal outline of the headlamps etc. so you'd have fix the car hoods (i almost said bonnet) as well. 
</s><s>what else do you have in mind?</s><s> i'd hit google images for something like 'war sky' and composite that behind the buildings.</s><s> same thing for a big crater in the road.</s><s> find an image of an arial view of a car, and composite the front half inside your new crater.</s><s> wow, this could be fun. 
</s><s>how about some fire?</s><s> you can do it with custom brushes really easy using red and yellow/orange.</s><s> broken glass.</s><s> take out a lot of that colour and and make it dark and moody.</s><s> think sin city. broken windows, and some refugee pictures from a news page.</s><s> getting a bit tasteless now. sorry...

<s>for many of the car lights, just painting over them would be okay for the very small lights.</s><s> if you really want to get detailed, i would do a search on the type of cars in the image and find photos showing their headlights off, then recreate those in your image. for the street lights, you have a few that are off, so i would use those as a base to copy for the ones that are on.</s><s> for the signals, i would clone the part of the signal that is off over the part that's on.

<s>i have some charts that i need to use in an a memory limited device.</s><s> the charts are large in size to begin with so compression is important.</s><s> i also need transparency. 
</s><s>in an ideal world, these charts would have a single color per elevation.</s><s> then there are annotations in 4 colors. 
</s><s>the process for creating the charts looks like: 
1.</s><s> printed in 14 colors 2.</s><s> scanned 24 bit 3.</s><s> saved as 8-bit index color with dithering. 
</s><s>these transformation have a devestating impact on compression.</s><s> the areas of constant elevation appear to the eye to be solid.</s><s> if you zoom in, the pixels are random colors. 
</s><s>going from uncompressed to png-8, the compression ratio is a dismal 5:3 for 32 bpp png, there is no compression (or there is no compression). 
</s><s>that's kind of odd because, with 1/3 to 1/4 the data, the 8bpp version is 60% the size.

<s>first thing you need to know: kernel panics cannot be caused by applications, ever.</s><s> kernel panics (and bluescreens on windows) can only be caused by defects in the os, bugs in low level drivers, and hardware problems.

<s>totally agree with saikosama.

<s>dear agentpuddles007... are you kiddin' right? 
not only i have paid for the software but they sent me 2 boxes by mistake and i returned the second one after letting them know of the issue... 
so i think i am honest enough to express my thoughts here 
nothing personal btw, i see why a warez user would need to do this but honestly i think it'd be easier and quicker to download another illegal version than asking for help in an official forum...

<s>those of you who are legitimate photoshop users - you know we're not talking to you.Ê if you are a legitimate user, you should well be supporting those of us speaking to the people who have illegally downloaded a cracked version in a language other than their own! Ê it may well be a desirable feature for adobe to support your changing the language.Ê but they simply don't.Ê Ê possibly this is because pirated versions being limited to a single language cuts down the number of people who would want to download them.Ê maybe they sell more legitimate copies due to this than they would to multilingual people who would appreciate the ability to legitimately change language at will.Ê Ê or maybe there are good technical reasons why a different build is needed for polish than english.Ê there are differences in files, beyond the language resources, even between en-us and en-gb versions. Ê clearly adobe has made this decision with their eyes open.Ê go ahead and ask for a different decision, but it's unlikely it's going to get you anywhere.Ê and for god's sake stop being put off by people who aren't tolerant of software pirates!Ê the world needs more such people!

<s>i wanted to follow up on my opening post and chris' subsequent follow ups. 
</s><s>it appears we are no further forward with finding a resolution and our feeling of being second class customers to adobe's apple users what does seem incredible is the fragmented nature of adobe's code base across it's product line with some current applications supporting true hidpi scaling out of the box, others don't, while older versions of non supporting applications previously up-scaled (blurry) but now don't even do that. 
</s><s>what i can't understand is why hidpi support on windows seems to have taken adobe by surprise, did they not realise it was imminent when apple introduced retina displays? 
i would also like to return to chris' comment back on the 28th oct regarding the lack of retina style scaling api's in windows.</s><s> windows 8.1 at least has such an api available with support through ms visual studio 2013: 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br226166 
http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/scaling-sample-cf072f4f 
however something tells me that adobe doesn't use msvs to take advantage of this api. 
</s><s>so my laptop upgrade is on hold indefinately until this is resolved or we at least get the common courtesy from adobe to inform it's windows based creative cloud subscribers when such an important feature is to be supported.

<s>i concur with what has been said, it is a disgrace on the part of adobe to invest so little for such a pressing matter.</s><s> many applications scale very well with windows 8.1, including a few of adobe.</s><s> in addition, not having vector ui elements that scale is so 1990 and highly distasteful from the market leader in vector tools.</s><s> it simply shows how many years adobe has been living on super fat upgrade prices for very little additional features and next to no in-depth improvements. 
</s><s>my experience with the new dell xps 15 3200x1800, which is truly an outstanding laptop in its own right, for cs6 work: don't bother for illustrator, after effects, premiere.</s><s> it isn't optimal for photoshop but i personnally use much less dialogbox based addons.</s><s> knowing all keyboard shortcuts becomes almost mandatory.</s><s> indesign scales perfectly, as well as lightroom 5.2 
</s><s>so my advice is to pressure adobe into giving a timetable of when the situation will be resolved and plan purchasing a laptop at this time. 
</s><s>my advice for adobe would be to start taking the indesign/lightroom team to teach the old guard how things are done. 
</s><s>if you want to buy a laptop with super high resolution now, and again many applications work very well as is under windows 8.1, be prepared to work with a non super high resolution external monitor for adobe work.</s><s> if you don't like this solution i recommend postponing the laptop purchase, as you would be disappointed for what are in effet amazing laptops.</s><s> or purchase them with a 1920x1080 resolution and with the sparred money buy a high res external monitor when the time comes. 
</s><s>update there is a potential mitigating workaround, but you'll have to test it to see if it's for you or not.</s><s> use the windows magnifier ( 'windows key' + 'plus key') to zoom in, set it on magnifying glass mode (not full screen mode) in the drop down or with ctrl-alt-l optionally, you may want to adjust the size of the zoomed window to taste with ctrl-alt-r, then move the mouse to resize and click to set.</s><s> i find that a wide rectange works well fo rme.</s><s> when not needed any more either use windows key + minus key to zoom out or press windows + esc to close the windows magnifier.</s><s> note that windows+ minus doesn't work on my laptop, it works only with the minus of the numeric keypad.</s><s> but win + esc is a working alternative. 
i find the magnifier of tremendous help with adobe's tiny ui elements.

<s>apparently it's been around for a while... and it's pretty silly that it's not solved in 2010 by either adobe cs5 or apple's os x 10.6.4 .</s><s> i think though since this doesn't happen with any other files but photoshop files that i've seem, the photoshop guys need to look into this and find some new routines to call for saving and/or mitigating locks on files... either way adobe and/or apple engineers should squash this lame bug, even if they are in some contention as to who's fault it is and simply serve their customers.</s><s> note: this bug is rearing it's head on xinet fullpress system that is running k-ashare for it's afp stack, so it seems less likely to be an os x filesystem bug but rather photoshop's handling of file locks?</s><s> any adobe engineers care to enlighten me and my speculations? 

http://support.grouplogic.com/?p=1664 

</s><s>symptom: a photoshop error occurs when saving a file to an apple file protocol (afp) network share.</s><s> error Ð 'photoshop could not save "file" because write access was not granted'.</s><s> cause: when photoshop saves a document, it deletes the current file, creates a new blank file with the same name, and then attempts to open the new file for writing.</s><s> finally, it writes the image being saved to the new file.</s><s> if any part of this process fails, the original file is lost.</s><s> the most common way this error is triggered, is if one user is saving a document while a second user is browsing through the same folder where the document is being saved.</s><s> the problem happens because when the finder reads a file to create a preview, a write lock is placed on the file so that it cannot be changed while it is being read.</s><s> due to this write lock by the second user the first user is unable to save changes to the file that they just created.</s><s> although the timing has to be just right, with many users browsing the directory, the issue can occur frequently.</s><s> this error is reproducible against any file server using either afp or smb Ð it does not specifically relate to extremez-ip.</s><s> theoretically the same error can occur even when saving a file locally.</s><s> you can also trigger the error by having a second mac browsing for a file in photoshop or another application's open dialog.</s><s> workaround: there is not much that can be done other than reattempting the save, using "save as" with a unique filename, or saving locally and then copying to the server.</s><s> it is a good idea (although maybe not feasible depending on the environment) to avoid having more than one user working on files in the same folder.</s><s> photoshop has a number of problems when saving over a network and this is just one you may encounter.</s><s> adobe specifically does not support saving over the network.</s><s> adobe has a product called version cue specifically for managing shared files and file versioning.</s><s> fix: there is no fix at this time.</s><s> see workaround

<s>okay chris, Ê clear aswer, but it leaves me with my problem.</s><s> fact is (in my case), files that should be overwritten are only deleted and never get replaced. Ê let's assume it is only an os and server issue. Ê besides normal file lock behaviour cause of clients opening files simultaniously (which is clearly visisble in win2003) it is hard to determine obsolete os behaviour. Ê grouplogic's extreme-zip tries to bridge all the gaps apple and microsoft have left.</s><s> (eg. microsoft didn't upgrade apple protocols since winnt4 and mac smb clients aren't trouble free either) Ê i don't use extremezip, since osx 10.5 apple has upgraded their smb client to a level which seems to work for most software.</s><s> so i only use aplles native smb client connected to win2003 server. Ê having these purged files experiences in photoshop it might be due to: - server settings which i can adjust myself if i know what setting or key to modify.</s><s> (several options in www.macwindows.com) - a microsoft/apple bug (wait for updates?</s><s>) Ê but... Ê if even extreme-zip mentions this behaviour, their software bypassed most of the microsoft architecture.</s><s> even if their analysis of the problem is wrong, mentioning the same behaviour in extremezip, made me conclude the above scenario isn't the case, but it might be "by design" somewhere... Ê if photoshop makes the right api calls...... Ê whats left is the osx/finder design or an incompatibilty between mac/pc that can't be bridged by apple somehow. Ê macs cant sa(f/v)e on windows networks.</s><s> that would be a pretty bold conclusion. Ê Ê thanx for your answer so far, Ê olaf

<s>
</s><s>the following shots are of test files from a production server running xinet fullpress, i mention the extremezip article because it is the only seemingly solidly documented article on an issue that quite a few people seem to be having. 
</s><s>so i ran some tests to recreate the problem, because if it can't be recreated it's not a problem in the it world i know because i am in the it dept at an advertising agency here in chicago administrating over a 130 macs- so that aside, here's a long winded run down of the tests 
i've posted screenshots at: http://picasaweb.google.com/116782194976328390062/photoshopfilesavingi ssue?authkey=gv1srgcmk3xpavriffgae 
and a movie of a save action stuck attempting to save to .afpdeleted file while the source file is not on the server: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fgmaapamvc 
these are unlisted galleries and videos and will be removed when no longer needed 
----------------- 
2 machines are used for the test 
machine #1 is running os x 10.6.4 and is browsing the folder with finder machine #2 also 10.6.4 with cs5 is saving to the same file at the moment computer #1 is browsing it with finder and generating a preview 
most times, the file is deleted and replaced, finder will "kick you out" of the folder when the file is resaved, or other times show no preview, the timing needs to be precise (yet we have users who aren't trying this on purpose at all and manage to have this happen to them!</s><s>).</s><s> 
</s><s>when a write error does occur sometimes it says: 
a) "could not save "name" because write access was not granted" with the correct name used and the files remains. 
b) "could not save "name" because write access was not granted" with the correct name used and the original file is gone but a .afpdeletedxxxxxxxx file is found in the directory via terminal 
c) "could not save "name" because write access was not granted" with the name .afpdeletedxxxxxxxxxx used and the original file is gone although the .afpdeleted file is found via terminal, it can be copied to a name that finder will not hide, but it's hidden flags are set and 'chflags nohidden' needs to be run for it to appear in finder 

</s><s>in scenario c, photoshop will attempt to save to the .afpdeleted name with using save even though the document name is being displayed properly in the photoshop window.</s><s> using lsof it can be seen that photoshop have the resource fork in use (only after the 2nd save attempt though), closing all open documents will still have this file in use, only upon quitting will it not be. 
i wish i had taken a look at the .afpdeleted flags to see if it was locked or not during this, but lsof results of it being in use is pretty weird! 
</s><s>so here's some more puzzling evidence, thanks for your help.

and run: ls -la this will show all files including "dot files" with a period at the front that finder will not show

<s>so same setup, one 10.6.4 laptop browsing the folder at the same time as a write operation, both using smb to mount the volume.

</s><s>two different error messages are used: could not save "filename.psd" because write access was not granted could not save "filename.psd" because an unexpected end-of-file was encuntered 

</s><s>sometimes save and save-as will balk at using the same name even though it doesn't show on lsof as being used (i should have tried to 'touch' the same path to see if it was a server lock but i didn't think to at the time) if you change the name it saves fine, try the original name, no-go, it says there's an unexpected eof.</s><s> other times it will save fine after an error that deletes the file. 
</s><s>there are two movies illustrating this (unlisted links) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvx032erta http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybxfybcatfa (this one shows the file dissapearing) 
</s><s>screeshots are available on picasa (shots prefixed with smb): photoshopfilesavingissue 
now while finder is a common among element in this (can anyone else say that finder is "looking" at these files like in my tests?</s><s>) however we only started seeing this when we upgraded our digital team from cs4 to cs5. 
</s><s>this seems to be an issue with these servers as reported here: afp on extreme-zip - grouplogic afp on mac os x server - sean-gloss afp on xinet - brunerd smb on xinet - brunerd smb on win2003 - olafbrand

<s>check your photoshop edit log.

http://lists.apple.com/archives/colorsync-users/2011/jan/msg00131.html

<s>but why is photoshop making a log entry saying that a file is saved with a temporary file name?</s><s> that strikes me as odd because it looks as if photoshop is treating this incorrect behaviour as an ordinary, valid save operation. 
</s><s>the only thing that the user sees is the error dialog stating that it doesn't have permission to write/overwrite a file with the same temporary name.</s><s> when what has actually happened is that photoshop *has* already written the hidden temporary file and then either it or the os has deleted the original. 
</s><s>unfortunately it's difficult to isolate the problem because it only started happening last year with two new cs5 installations on new mac pros running 10.6.5/6.</s><s> on older macs we are still using older versions of photoshop and they've never exhibited this behaviour. 
</s><s>thinking about it further i'm certain that this rogue behaviour also produces save as dialog boxes where the both the file list and the file name fields were both empty -- meaning that either photoshop or the os (or both) had lost any reference to what the file should be called and whether it already existed in the destination folder. 
</s><s>if this were just an os bug then i'd expect to see it happening with other applications -- but honestly cannot recall any occasions when this happened. 
i did notice that cs4 would often refuse to save files to both remote and local drives if you mounted/unmounted other volumes (not those that you were using) while working on an image.

<s>well, i'll say that the issue has not re-occurred for me.</s><s> i'm running the cs6 suite, i have one serial number for everything.</s><s> after upgrading on thursday 12/13 every single one of my adobe products were "de-registered." as in, all of them reverted to trial mode.</s><s> when i rustled up the serial number and entered it when asked to do so, things reverted to "working fine" and i have not had to re-enter any serial numbers again. 
</s><s>i'm not using any of these "creative cloud" services and after this little snafu i'm going to be a little gunshy for subscribing to them.

<s>sunday, december 16,2012 @ 7;45 a.m.</s><s> est helloeveryone, 
</s><s>now i'm starting to get a bit more irritated.</s><s> as the famous ny yankees catcher once said (no disrespect to you yogi berra) - "it's not over 'til it's over". 
</s><s>i've already posted here and several other palces with this problem!</s><s> i purchased a full-paid for or so i thought license from adobe for a standalone cs6 photoshop.</s><s> i went through previous problems, and now i have this one: 
i'm just goint to let the screencaptures do the talking for me. 


1. the latest notice - 
you can try this product for 32767 days.</s><s> you can continue to use adobe photoshop cs6 after your trial period by purchasing the software. 

2. 

3.</s><s> i don't have the photoshop extended trial.</s><s> i downloaded the trial, then uninstalled it.</s><s> i can't find it anywhere onmy computer.</s><s> i looked again, based on someone giving me expert advise as to where to look, and where to do the uninstalling. 

4. 
5. my photoshop copy -paid in full - not licensed and not the extended version. 

6. screen-capture asking me to fill in my serial number a few days ago, after speaking with an adobe rep on chat, i was advised to enter my ps6 standalone serial number,and so i did this today. 

7.i added my s/n (most numbers removed to hide my s/n) 
</s><s>photoshop now works. 
</s><s>the questions now are: 
1.</s><s> exactly what did i pay for?</s><s> 2. where is the "contratc" from adobe to show me that i did not pay for a full copy, but a 32767 day "trial" version (not that i'm goin to live that many years!</s><s>).</s><s> 3. how many times is this "irritation" going to continue to happen before some adobe rep helps here!

<s>stacey, 
</s><s>i experienced exactly the same thing.</s><s> after spending quite some time in "chat" with adobe customer service, here is the response i received: 

</s><s>sorry for the small print.</s><s> basically, this nonsense is somehow embedded in the $199.00 download upgrade of cs6.</s><s> no mention of "trial version", or "cs6 - extended" is mentioned when purchasing this download.</s><s> on my adobe receipt it clearly states that i purchased for $199.00.....</s><s> "photoshop cs6 (mac, english).</s><s> after receiving the above email, it has happened again.</s><s> again i had to plug in my serial number to get it from cs6 extended trial version, back to cs6.</s><s> i am personally furious with adobe and consider this to be an insulting marketing scam.</s><s> if anyone is considering "upgrading" from cs5 to cs6....the $199.00 upgrade to cs6 is not what it pretends to be.</s><s> it is not an upgrade to cs6.</s><s> it is a trial version of cs6 extended that acts like cs6 for 30 days and then starts pestering the user to get cs6 extended.

<s>i really don't think this is a marketing scam.</s><s> it has to be a bug in the updating software.</s><s> if nothing else, the fact that it says "you can try this product for 32767 days" is to me clear evidence that it is a bug.</s><s> that is the magic number for the number of bytes in an integer in many programming languages, more than most people will live and clearly a bug.</s><s> besides, i really doubt that adobe would resort to such stupid marketing which does little more than really annoy people - i too was pretty mad yesterday at wasting several hours and being invaded by this nonsense.
