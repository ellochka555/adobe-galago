<s>hello, as with others on this forum, my company and i have had our fair share of hiccups with adobe connect.</s><s> i have tried to alieviate some of these by creating a checklist of tasks to preform before starting a meeting or webinar.</s><s> i am posting this here to see if any of you have more ideas/suggestions/critiques for the list.</s><s> it has recently been created so updates/edits will come regularly (also the list hasnt been organized properly yet so excuse that).</s><s> i hope this collaboration helps others as well as gives me some feedback to help us. thanks for contributing! 
</s><s>here is what i have so far: 
suggestions for an ideal attendee experience: verify connection speed attendee connection test - (http://admin.adobeconnect.com/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm# content) verify flash player is up to date flash player test - (http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/find-version-flash-player.html) close all applications (especially ones that compete for bandwidth like, browser, email, etc.</s><s>) do not use google chrome hardwire your network connection with an ethernet cable, do not use wifi turn off any virus scanning software or any firewalls 
precourse checklist for host/presenter: set meeting room bandwidth to "cable/dsl" change local storage limit.</s><s> right click/settings/local storage (the picture of a file)/slide bar to unlimited configure audio/video close all applications (especially ones that compete for bandwidth like: internet browser, email, etc.</s><s>) reboot computer do not use google chrome hardwire your network connection with an ethernet cable, no wifi turn off any virus scanning software or any firewalls make sure computer is plugged into power (weve had the host computer battery die and it was traumatic) 

</s><s>let me know what you think, if its helpful, and if you have any suggestions. 
</s><s>thanks, corey hammond

<s>corey, 
</s><s>great checklist!</s><s> thanks for putting this out to the community.</s><s> i have a few thoughts to add to it, which you may take or leave as you see fit. 
i would drop the #content from the link to the test page, as it places the viewer at the bottom of the page.</s><s> if this is the desired location, then disregard, but i would suspect that most people would be looking for the wizard at the top of the page.</s><s> the flash player version check is done as part of the test in the first link, so it seems redundant, and not necessary.</s><s> the local storage limit should be modified when the meeting room is launched and active (that may or may not be clear from your steps above).</s><s> i would also recommend having something stating that all microphones, webcams and/or headsets should be plugged into the computer prior to launching the meeting room.</s><s> this helps eliminate some issues with flash using the wrong components or not recognizing the correct components. 
</s><s>thanks again for getting this started!

<s>hi corey, 
</s><s>i would perhaps add another item in the 'checklist for hosts/presenters' * presenters should try 'sharing' once before the meeting starts.</s><s> at times, it requires new addin to install and if that installation triggers during the meeting, it can eat up few mins from your meeting time.</s><s> sharing ahead of meeting will ensure, you have the required addin installed.

<subject>First Event/Webinar Yesterday After Upgrade - Numerous Bugs</subject>
<post author="tireduser" timestamp="Mar 19, 2014 6:51 AM">
<s>fortunately no showstoppers, but it was concerning... 
</s><s>the below issues were experienced yesterday during a live event webinar.</s><s> fortunately they impacted only those with host permissions.</s><s> fortunately the attendees were not impacted.</s><s> for this event we had 5 different hosts, all separately logged in from different machines, from 3 different physical locations (florida, pa, texas).</s><s> this was in a seminar room.</s><s> i assume they are specific to the latest upgrade, because we never experienced these problems before. 
</s><s>issues experienced by hosts: 
1.</s><s> when first logging in, the share pod with a pptx file shared was not loading for the hosts.</s><s> the rest of the connect room/pods loaded and displayed fine, but the pptx share pod was in a continual 'preload' state with the preloader animation (spinning circle/lines) showing.</s><s> this happened with two different share pods with pptx files loaded into them prior to the event so that they would be ready once the event started.</s><s> workaround: stop the share and restart it after the hosts had already logged in. 
2.</s><s> poll pods: when i select the pod options > "hide" option to hide the poll from the stage, it doesn't go away.</s><s> it stays.</s><s> the only way to get rid of them was to drag it to the presenter only area.</s><s> a minute later i found out that, even though it was off of the stage for me and attendees, it was still on the stage for the other hosts, and the only way to get rid of them was to manually drag each poll to the poa on each and every host's machine. 
</s><s>note: this issue did not impact the first poll used during the event, but it did the second and third polls, which were both introduced to the stage at the same time.</s><s> perhaps two polls on the stage at the same time caused the issue? 
3.</s><s> q&a pod: export to rtf does not export all of the questions!</s><s> i would need to go back to look at exactly what questions it did export, but of the 12 questions asked during the event, only 4 of them were in the "export to rtf" file.</s><s> fortunately, the "email q&a" transcript works fine - all 12 questions were in the text emailed. 
</s><s>we're on a hosted instance of connect.

<subject>Application Issue - Adobe connect unable to handle "unreachable" responses</subject>
<post author="DaniilM" timestamp="Mar 9, 2014 2:49 PM">
<s>hi, 
</s><s>we've discovered what seems to be a bug with the adobe connect application/flash player. 
</s><s>for some reason when you have a proxy in place adobe connect still attempts to establish a direct connection to the adobe servers (for example na7fms2.adobeconnect.com), if these packets get dropped video plays with no issue. 
</s><s>however in our case we have acl's setup on our cisco routing core (which do not allow this traffic), which in turn respond with "destination unreachable (communication administratively filtered)". 
</s><s>adobe connect seems to be unable to handle these responses and goes into a loop continiously attempting a direct connection (around every 10-12 seconds), therefore causing streaming video's to restart every 10-12 seconds. 
</s><s>below is a screenshot of the packet capture of the accurance. 


</s><s>basically we managed to create two of the following scenarios in our network. 
</s><s>video restarts every 10-12 seconds: 

</s><s>video plays with no issues: 

</s><s>now this "destination unreachable" response is completely legal in terms of rfc http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc792.txt 
it would be great if this issue could be raised as a bug and fixed in future versions.

<post author="tfoveketa" timestamp="Mar 17, 2014 9:52 AM">
<s>hi, Ê first day using the software.</s><s> i cannot log in as a host to a new meeting i've created even though i am the account admin, i created the meeting, and i am defined as a host in the meeting users. Ê i am using chrome and i have checked into the flash issue.</s><s> i am not using the newer flash that is built into chrome.</s><s> i have also tried logging in with internet explorer.</s><s> same issue. Ê i log into the meeting. it doesn't ask me to download the adobe connect add-in, but i see a quick message for 1 second which looks like it says its downloading adobe connect (maybe?</s><s>) before the actual connecting bar comes up.</s><s> then i am stuck in the meeting as a participant, and i can't change my user type. Ê this is a new account.</s><s> is there anything that might not be activated yet with it?</s><s> i didn't even get my account password yet from my sales rep, but just clicked that i forgot my password and the system let me reset it so i could get in quicker (haha).</s><s> everything else seems to be working.</s><s> so help please! Ê also, i cannot create a password login for the meeting?</s><s> isn't that supposed to be an option in the meeting creation menu? Ê thanks, william

<s>you are most likely using the named host licensing model.</s><s> as such, you will need to be a member of the meeting host group to host a meeting. 
</s><s>exact verbiage for the named host license: 
named hosts may create an unlimited number of meeting rooms, however, the named host can only use one of their rooms at any one time and rooms cannot be accessed unless the named host is present. 
</s><s>as an admin you can create rooms, but you cannot host them.
