<s>photshop 6 and 7 are compatible with ags.</s><s> photoshop 6 will better match the text formatting of ags.</s><s> however, the differences in text formatting between ags and photoshop 7 are subtle: a few pixels of vertical shift or differing line breaks.</s><s> you are describing something else.</s><s> are you using the replacetext command?</s><s> that should give better results than trying to use the "set" command.</s><s> replacetext uses the format of the first character being replaced: " the command uses the style of the first character (of the entire text or of the specified texttoreplace string) for the entire replacement text string."

<s>if you created the template with cs1 or cs2, that may be the problem.</s><s> the shift happens to me with your template.</s><s> when i recreate the text in photoshop 7, it works as expected (but i didn't add the effect).</s><s> doing a save as of your original from ps 7 didn't help.
