capture provides the facility of exporting the design to pdf, subject to the availability of postscript (ps) driver and postscript-to-pdf converter software on user's machine.</s><s> the following diagram shows the architecture of pdf export 

13.3 use model 
the use-model of pdf export is as follows- 
? user acquires a suitable postscript driver - user can install any suitable postscript driver an example is adobe universal postscript driver for windows (acrobat distiller postscript printer driver) that can be downloaded and installed from http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/product.jsp?platform=win&produc t=pdrv).</s><s> in case of installing this driver, the following two files need to be downloaded from this location:

o 


</s><s>adobe universal postscript windows driver installer - english (http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpid=1500) 

a postscript printer (on the network or attached to the machine) can also be used as a postscript driver.</s><s> output will vary depending on the selected postscript driver. ? user acquires a suitable postscript-to-pdf converter - user can acquire any third party postscript to pdf converter tool and use the tool for generating the pdf output from the postscript file.</s><s> examples are distiller from acrobat professional (commercial and can be acquired from http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobatpro ) or ghostscript (free and can be acquired from http://sourceforge.net/projects/ghostscript).</s><s> there are many other commercial and free tools available.</s><s> user needs to acquire or purchase any of these tools and install the software at their end.

<s>there is no such beast as an adobe printer driver for any version of windows beyond windows nt4 and windows'98.</s><s> the adobe printer driver installer simply associates a user-specified ppd (postscript printer description) file for a particular printer model with the pscript5 driver that comes with the operating system for versions of windows starting with windows 2000.</s><s> in most cases, it is not at all different than using the add printer wizard. 
</s><s>note that the adobe printer driver installer does not work with any version of windows beyond windows xp and with no 64-bit version of windows.</s><s> (it is a 16-bit application and such applications won't even run on 64-bit windows.</s><s>) 
</s><s>adobe has not plans to update that installer given that the original versions of windows for which it was intended no longer are supported by microsoft and similar functionality for postscript printers is available through the add printer wizard (normally using the same pscript5 driver as a base used by the old adobe installer) or through custom installers provided by individual printer manufacturers.</s><s> very, very few printer vendors provide truly unique postscript drivers for their (typically) clonescript printers; such drivers typically don't work properly with postscript-centric applications such as adobe acrobat & reader, adobe framemaker, adobe's creative suite applications, quarkxpress, coreldraw, etc. many vendors (including those using adobe postscript) use pscript5 as a base with their own ppd as well as proprietary driver plug-ins that provide some "product differentiation" to the driver (sometimes good, sometimes bad).

<subject>How do I print a million dots on a single sheet of 8.5x11 paper?</subject>
<post author="million_dots" timestamp="Sep 29, 2013 7:17 PM">
<s>hi, 
</s><s>i have something i want to print which is a little off the beaten path, so to speak.</s><s> i know next to nothing about printing so i need help.</s><s> i am doing this for educational purposes to try to get across the concept of large numbers to elementary school kids. 
i want to put exactly one million visible, distinct dots on one 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper, plus be able to put some comments on the sides, top, or bottom, and perhaps highlight a few of the dots with color around them instead of white.</s><s> i realize that the dots will be quite small.</s><s> it would also be nice if the page could be reproduced on a copier tho that is not a requirement. 
i have the following equipment and software: i run 32-bit linux.</s><s> i have a variety of programs which go with my linux (latest slackware) such as emacs for (maybe?</s><s>) creating repetitive printer commands and gimp for creating and editing images.</s><s> my printer is an oki c5300 color laser printer which, as i understand it, can print emulating postscript 3 and pcl 5c.</s><s> it has a resolution of 600 dpi. 
i think i would prefer a rectangular grid like this where * is a dot and _ is white or light color 
_________ _*_*_*_*_ _________ _*_*_*_*_ _________ _*_*_*_*_ _________ 
which would be more distinct, i think, than a chessboard pattern like this 
__________ _*_*_*_*__ __*_*_*_*_ _*_*_*_*__ __*_*_*_*_ _*_*_*_*__ __*_*_*_*_ __________ 
but a chessboard pattern would be better for improved density.</s><s> being able to try both would be good because you really can't tell how it looks until you actually see it. 
</s><s>assuming that i can control each and every printer dot and that i can print 7.5x10 inches, then i have room for 7.5x10x600x600 == 27,000,000 printer dots on the page.</s><s> since i want a million visible dots on a square grid that means that each visible dot can be int( sqrt( 27000000 / 1000000 )) == 5 printer dots on each side.</s><s> thus each visible dot would look like the following in printer dots: 
_____ _***_ this would allow for 16/25 white and 9/25 black, and there _***_ would be two rows of white vertically and horizontally _***_ between each visible dot. _____ 
or _____ __**_ this would have much more separation between the visible dots __**_ but the visible, 4/25 black part of the dot would be much _____ smaller.</s><s> it's hard to tell whether this or the above would _____ be more visible when actually on paper. 
</s><s>the above are for the rectangular layout.</s><s> a checkerboard layout would alternate cells with visible dots with empty cells, thus giving me 1/2 the visible dot density.</s><s> thus my rectangles would be reduced to 3x3.</s><s> in order to separate dots at the corners i would have to use something like one of the following patterns: 
_*_ *** _*_ 
or 
*** *** _*_ 
both would give more ink per visible dot than the 4/25 black pattern above but with much more separation between dots. 
</s><s>again it's hard to say which of the 4 schemes above would look the best until i actually see it on paper. 
i see three ways of doing these 4 schemes: (1) issue lots of nearly repetitive printer commands.</s><s> (2) build a glyph with 10x10 visible dots in it which uses up the entire character cell space and aligns the dots properly on each side and above and below, and then just print 10,000 of them in a rectangle which fits on 8.5x11 paper where the last row does not have to be the size of the other rows.</s><s> (3) make an uncompressed, high resolution image of 1,000,000 dots and just print it, but would there be problems in translation from image to printer? 
i have another question: assuming again that i can access each printer dot, can i also control the size of that dot (within reason)? 

</s><s>that's kind of the limit of what i currently can guess for this project.</s><s> all useful hints, ideas, suggestions, etc, will be appreciated.</s><s> please reply via this website or via the email address i set up for this project: jeff.b.million_dots@myletters.us also if you know of another forum where i could ask this question please let me know about it. 

</s><s>thank you in advance, jeff b.

<s>basd on your description, it would seem that you are producing postscript for distillation into pdf, correct?

</s><s>changing font names implies that you know the postscript name for the font, not necessarily the name that you might see in a layout program when you create content.</s><s> if you don't have and use the postscript name, the search for the font will fail. 
</s><s>also be aware that by changing the font name, other aspects of your job may differ and possibly fail.</s><s> different fonts have different character widths.</s><s> as such, you may end up with very strange looking output since the positioning of text strings was done on the basis of the original fonts specified in the postscript file.

<s>selva, 
</s><s>after you have confirmed/replaced your text editor - that it is not changing line endings or binary data in the postscript file, as dov suggested, i would suggest searching for the offending command (in this case it appears to be a solitary question mark).</s><s> if the offending command appears multiple times and it is not apparent why any of the occurrences would cause an error, then you could use some variation of the following postscript print code inserted at appropriate points to help you determine the location of the error:
