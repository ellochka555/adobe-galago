<subject>Making app less book-like. How do I add this pop-up effect?</subject>
<post author="Kratos27" timestamp="Mar 22, 2014 5:01 AM">
<s>hi, i've just had my app rejected by apple for being 'primarilly a book.' my app is a reference guide that does have text on pages.</s><s> it has 50 short videos and there is a page with loads of buttons that play audio samples.</s><s> a few images also are slideshows (2-3 pictures).</s><s> i am very disappointed because there are so many comparable apps that are just books and i feel that if i removed the text from my app it would have been approved. 
</s><s>so i want to try and make my less book-like but am also constrained by having only core dps skills which i've piece together from the dps tips app and some lynda.com videos for an older edition of dps.</s><s> so i was hoping for a bit of aesthetic advice and some tech help? 

</s><s>in the my 9 months app there is an effect where if you touch a button a pop-up image appears and a black film is placed on background image, press the x and the pop-up and film disappear.</s><s> what's this feature called and where can i learn to do it? 



</s><s>i've also seen an effect where when you turn on to a page, a large image is shown, then another, the another so that you finally see all three at the same time.</s><s> how is that done? 

</s><s>the videos are full screen width and inserted into their own page with a poster screenshot that has the play symbol.</s><s> they play when the user taps them.</s><s> would it be less book-like if rather then giving the videos their own page, i inserted a 'play video' button on the text reference page which then played it in a fullscreen video player? 
</s><s>my current page layout is that a user swipes horizontally left or right for a new chapter.</s><s> and they can swipe up or down for different articles in a chapter.</s><s> is this detrimental to it being labelled an app? 

</s><s>any help is appreciated.</s><s> cheers!</s><s>

<s>hello bob 
</s><s>i was expecting two things: 
1: security after publishing: i would understand the lack of security after publishing with a free platform or one that has no in-app purchasing or subscription features, but with a platform like dps featuring in-app purchasing and subscription there should be drm or some other security measure to prevent the premium contents from being compromised so easily.</s><s> i know that it is impossible to secure any digital contents even with drm, but the problem here is not weak protection it is the lack of any protection after publishing!

<s>bob levine wrote:

</s></quote>
</s><s>what i find really disturbing is that although i don't have any knowledge of programming or coding but with a very popular and basic tool called iexplorer i was able to extract all the videos from a folio i was developing!</s><s>!</s><s> which means anyone can do it! 

2: transparency by adobe: other then the dps_security_faq.pdf document there is very little information about security after publishing. 
<quote>
<s>dps_security_faq.pdf 
</s><s>"is it secured after publishing?</s><s> published folios on the distribution service can be accessed via http rest apis.</s><s> folios published privately require login to the distribution service in order to retrieve a token used to access the private folio." 
</s></quote>
the faq above is very misleading because any contents even in privately published folios are very easy to have access to after publishing. 
i am hoping to see improvements on security after publishing in the future, but unfortunately, with the current state of adobe dps i can only trust it with free or promotional contents, i will be looking for a more secured way to publish retail contents.

<s>the following message was sent to professional edition subscribers.</s><s> if you have questions or concerns, please reach out to your reseller or someone from the adobe sales team.</s><s> if you don't have an adobe contact, please send me an email message, and i can ask someone to contact you.</s><s> my email is bbringhu@adobe.com. 
>>>>> 
</s><s>effective immediately, all customers who newly purchase or renew digital publishing suite (dps), professional edition, will be able to publish only one app per license of dps professional edition. 
</s><s>note: this change no longer affects existing apps under a professional edition license.</s><s> see my update below. 
</s><s>under this policy change, professional edition customers can publish an unlimited number of issues (.folio files) to a single app and distribute those issues based on purchased fulfillment bundles. 
</s><s>an app created with a single license of dps professional edition can be distributed to any or all of the marketplaces that dps supports, including the apple app store (and newsstand), google play, amazon appstore, and the windows store. 
</s><s>in conjunction with this policy change, adobe is reducing the price of a professional edition license to $4,800 usd annually (€3,600/¥480,000) or to $400 per month (€300/¥40,000) and will include 1,000 fulfillments annually.</s><s> the number of fulfillments included with a monthly subscription remain unchanged. 
</s><s>this policy does not apply to test or demo apps published using professional edition.</s><s> the one-app-per-license policy applies only to an app published to a supported marketplace(s). 
</s><s>if you are an agency, upon your renewal or purchase of professional edition, you can create only one app per professional edition license.</s><s> if you have multiple clients for whom you are creating apps, either you as the agency or your client must purchase a professional edition license for each app published to a supported marketplace(s). 
</s><s>if you are an existing professional edition customer and choose to renew your professional edition license at the end of your annual agreement, these changes, including the lower price point and 1,000 fulfillments, apply at that time.</s><s> these changes do not apply to your existing dps professional edition agreement and take effect only if you renew your license. 
</s><s>dps professional edition customers can continue to create unlimited single edition apps, which is unchanged under the new policy.</s><s> a single edition app is defined as an app that includes one built-in or embedded folio. 
</s><s>if you expect to publish three or more apps annually, we encourage you to contact your local reseller to discuss pricing for a multi-year enterprise edition license. 
</s><s>enterprise edition offers additional functionality and benefits not available through professional edition.</s><s> these include app customization, integration with back-end business systems, in-app marketing tools, targeted content based on user entitlement, and the ability to publish apps privately.

<s>i decided to reply here instead of the other little thread that was going (http://forums.adobe.com/thread/1419927?tstart=0). 
</s><s>i'm sure i'm not the only small agency owner that has a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach right about now.</s><s> this policy / pricing model change sinks my entire digital publishing business.</s><s> we cater to small local companies and produce multiple multi-folio apps for them.</s><s> none of them can support a $4800 per year fee.</s><s> as it stands currenlty, we are able to spread out the costs so that no one client pays more than $1000 per year (and some are less). 
</s><s>sorry if i sound like i'm just complaining, and believe me, i know i'm pissing into the wind here.</s><s> i'm just disappointed that adobe couldn't figure out a pricing model that allowed for the small guys to at least get in the door with their clients.</s><s> people always get peeved that apple / amazon / etc take 30% of their revenue... but, that model at least lets you get in the door.</s><s> it costs $100 and some know-how to get an app produced and into the app store. 
</s><s>adobe has now taken multi-folio apps off the table for almost any small agency like ours.</s><s> they instantly set a high barrier to entry, which i personally think is the wrong approach.</s><s> make us pay more if we're successful, but don't kill us for trying and failing.</s><s> which is what could happen now by forking over $4800 for a possibly untested app.</s><s> before this policy change we could at least indulge our creativity with clients, and let clients with little / no budgets get into the game.</s><s> now they're cut out... and unfortunately, so are we. 
</s><s>this is the only "rant" i've ever put in a forum (if you can believe that), and i hope its my last.</s><s> i hope one day to not be in this position.</s><s> i hope my small company can get to the point where we can afford an enterprise license.</s><s> i'm just afraid that dream became infinitely more difficult now as we can't "build" up to it any longer on our client base.</s><s> i, for one, won't stop serving the little local companies...

<s>i just had a long phone conversation with an adobe rep. he apologized for how the announcement was handled, which was appreciated.</s><s> he also stated that small agency customers such as myself are a very very small minority in the dps world (with multi-folio apps, at least), which i think we all could have assumed based on how this all went down. 
</s><s>adobe is trying to work something out with my agency to move onto an enterprise level 1 license.</s><s> i need to have further discussions with adobe on this, but it appears that they may require more from our side than we're able to provide.</s><s> specifically they'd like us to work toward converting one or more of our larger clients to their own license, and i just don't know how feasible that is.</s><s> i understand that adobe needs to grow their enterprise business, but as of right now, it leaves little to no room for the "little guys". 
</s><s>we talked at length about how a large part of my agency's developing business model is to create dps apps for small, local companies.</s><s> for instance, we have a couple of small furniture store clients that we were working with to produce multi-folio apps for.</s><s> something that none of their competitors has, and a potentially huge marketing opportunity!</s><s> again, this is one example, and i have many more.</s><s> under the old dps model, we could do this.</s><s> we could pick up enough small clients and offset the $6-9,000 / year cost of dps pro.</s><s> now, with moving to a per-app pricing model... this part of our business model can't work.</s><s> it's sad, because even though its such a small part of the adobe dps world, i think it holds great potential and opportunity for growth... for my small agency, and for adobe.</s><s> for now at least, that can't happen.</s><s> i think its a hole in adobe's strategy, and the only thing we can do is wait to see how long before they feel it necessary to pursue filling it... 
</s><s>without giving a ver-batim account of my conversations with the adobe rep, i'll try to keep everyone updated if you're interested.</s><s> you may not be a fit for what adobe is selling, but i think it at least warrants talking to adobe if you're a small agency such as ours affected by this.</s><s> we just have to swallow our medicine and realize they are not going to backtrack on this pricing model change, at least not anytime soon...

<s>update: 
</s><s>i have some updates that i hope address concerns raised about the change to the professional edition policy, and it's good news.</s><s> professional edition customers (monthly and annual) who have multiple apps in market are still able to publish into those existing apps per the previous terms of use.</s><s> customers will not have to remove their existing pro edition apps from the market or move them to individual pro edition licenses.</s><s> the bottom line is that existing pro edition apps are not affected by the new policy.</s><s> you can continue to publish into existing apps even after you choose to renew your pro edition license.</s><s> after you renew, you can create one additional app.</s><s> if you need to create more than one additional app, an additional pro edition license is required. 
</s><s>the new policy of one app per license applies only when a customer renews their professional edition monthly or annual subscription or to net new pro edition agreements.</s><s> if upon renewal of your pro edition license (monthly or annual) you decide you would like to publish three new apps (as an example), under the new policy you must purchase three individual pro edition license or upgrade to enterprise edition.</s><s> to address concerns more directly and discuss pricing options, adobe is encouraging customers to contact us at dpspro@adobe.com.</s><s> we will respond within 24 hours.</s><s> i highly encourage customers with pricing or any other concerns to contact adobe or send an email to the alias.</s><s> without going into detail, it is important to have a direct conversation with adobe in order to get accurate information on pricing options.

<s>hi there, 
the app i am working on currently needs to have a note-taking option, for which i follwed the steps outlined in this article: http://www.adobe.com/devnet/digitalpublishingsuite/articles/note-takin g-functionality.html 
i have 38 addnote files, and the first issue i had was that it didn't pick up the title and description i inserted in the databasedelegate.js file.</s><s> i contacted adobe and was told to do the following: 
in databasedelegate.js in init() they should comment out the following: db.transaction( function(tx) { tx.executesql( "select count(*) from items", null, function(tx, result) { if (initresulthandler) initresulthandler(); }, function(tx, error){ createdatabase(); } ); } ); 
replacing it with createdatabase(). 
</s><s>which i did, and now it does pick up the beforementioned missing info. however, the save function doesn't work anymore (it did before).

uninstall adobe creative suite on the system apply the cleaner @ http://www.adobe.com/support/contact/cscleanertool.html reinstall adobe creative suite 
2.</s><s> when user launches fbp or clicks on "sign in" link or menu, "sign in to creative cloud membership" dialog comes up, when user enters dps credential and click on "sign in", and error dialog is displayed with error [ims_error_in_save_user_data] and the user cannot sign in.</s><s> the known workaround is: 
close fbp and indesign; deleting /users/{username}/library/application support/adobe/oobe/opm.db or just remove the entire oobe folder; restart indesign and fbp; when the user clicks "sign in" again and enter the dps credential in "sign in to creative cloud membership"dialog to sign in, fbp should be able to enter online state and show all the folios in the account.

</s><s>the beta tools allowed this functionality (side loading folios that were saved to your desktop), but the final release version does not because the folio files are stored on the acrobat.com servers.

<s>thanks - that worked!</s><s> i overlooked that. 
</s><s>so, it looks like we won't be allowed local access to the folio file (as in, saving it to our own hard drive) after the beta release; it will only exist "in the cloud".</s><s> this is disappointing, and i guess it's in the interest of keeping people from distributing or hosting their own folio files on their own servers (instead of paying adobe do it). 
</s><s>it's too bad because by delivering folio files we create to clients who have the adobe content viewer installed* on their ipads, we could be making really nice tech-savvy presentations for them to use at trade shows, internal meetings, pitches, etc...</s><s> basically, the adobe content viewer could act like the the free acrobat reader, but for the ipad, opening folio files instead of pdfs.</s><s> hopefully, this or something similar is in the works. 
</s><s>with the current pricing structure, it's too cost prohibitive to make simple presentations.</s><s> it does make a lot of sense to make digital magazines, though.</s><s> i'm hoping that another pricing structure will be considered for more simple presentation-like apps (and hoping that the folio files can eventually be saved to our hard drives).</s><s> thanks for your time bob!

<s>i think that's true (each individual article is limited to 100mb - still waiting for an official confirmation), but the problem is you can't accurately preview things like page jump links (a link on one page to go to another page, for example, a table of contents) if you can only add one folio at a time. 
</s><s>is there a way to combine multiple 100 mb articles into one folio, then download and preview it as a complete digital magazine on the ipad? 
</s><s>it was much, much easier in the beta version of this software, which allowed you to side load any size article or multiple articles combined into one file on the ipad.</s><s> this is reliant on the file that is generated from indesign to be stored either locally, or on the user's own specified server.</s><s> local files was perfect.</s><s> i think i can understand why the files are being locked up "in the cloud", but it's not working out for us.
