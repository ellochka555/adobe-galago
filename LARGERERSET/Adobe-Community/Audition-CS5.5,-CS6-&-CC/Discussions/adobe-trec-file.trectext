<s>midi sequencing and vsti support is not available in audition cs6.</s><s> there was a lot of primary feature development this cycle, and i would not have wanted to make the compromises to a midi environment that would have been necessary to squeeze it in this cycle. 
</s><s>midi composition support remains in our feature backlog and is considered for each release, but there are several reasons it doesn't typically bubble up higher in priority.</s><s> audition and cool edit always shined as audio editing tools, and this has always been the focus of the team with midi support sort of an afterthought, but never our core competency.</s><s> with audition 3, we built a basic midi sequencer with vsti support, but ran into some implementation speed bumps when plugging it into the existing playback engine that resulted in a less-than-great experience in my opinion.</s><s> it functioned, but i've never felt it held up to the other areas of audition in terms of usability and simplicity.

<s>ok i see what is probably happening if you create a folder called test and then you open audition cs6 and create a new multitrack session called 'test' and you select the folder 'test' to place it in then audition creates a sub-folder called 'test' and puts a new sesx file called 'test' in it 
essentially au creates a folder the same name as the name of the project/sesx file and then creates an sesx file and puts it in that folder 
so what you need to do when doing the above (as an example) you would use the 'browse' button to tell au to create the multitrack session in the folder above where you think you want it - knowing that audition will create the folder for you - if the folder already exists au will say that the sesx file already exists (even if it doesn't and only the folder exists) and asks if you want to overwrite - in this case you would say yes 
make sense?

<subject>Audition CC Specific track split overlap/fade question</subject>
<post author="BJBBJB1" timestamp="Mar 13, 2014 4:29 PM">
<s>greetings, 
</s><s>i am very familiar with ppro and ps but only use audition cc once in a while.</s><s> i've found a couple adobe blog posts on this that helped but i need to know just 2 more things! 
i want to take a large live concert audio .</s><s>wav file and split it up into separate tracks.</s><s> of course easy to add markers and export into separate files.</s><s> i found a post on that.</s><s> but here is what i am not sure of.</s><s> when i select my track splits i want to be very sure that the next selection i make starts a second after the prior one.</s><s> so if i am selecting "sections" in order to place my markers, i am concerned i will ruin the overall cd. 
</s><s>now i know i can just split them and burn to cd, but i want the separate .</s><s>wav files because i would like to add some eq and effects on certain tracks.</s><s> then i want to re-combine them in the correct order so that the cd plays without breaks. 
</s><s>finally, for certain tracks i might want to add a fade out and fade in for the next track.</s><s> i would prefer not to have to render this type of effect.</s><s> for those tracks that i want to do this for, can i just add a setting and then when i "export" or "save as separate tracks" it will put the fade in there? 
i am cool with using other burning software to make my cd, and make sure i don't introduce gaps with the burning process, but i want to make sure i have good split audio files first. 

i thougth about applying all of my effects first on the one big file, but then i have the same issue.</s><s> my effects might overshoot and mess up some of the tracks that do have different sources and are not contiguous. 
</s><s>any help appreciated!</s><s> thanks, bjbbjb1

<s>probably your best bet is to put your continuous .wav into the multitrack view and split it up there.</s><s> because it is non destructive you can move the individual clips around, apply different effects to them, overlap them to create crossfades etc. without affecting the original file.</s><s> once you are happy with the editing you can mix the whole lot down to one continuous file again to apply the track markers to for the cd and burn from the newly mastered file.

<s>thanks for that.</s><s> i've played around with it and i think my pr pro experience will help.</s><s> does this sound like a reasonable workflow?</s><s> and i also snuck in a few questions 
-import the file -go to a multitrack view in with the same sample paramaters as my .wav file. -use the razor tool to cut each track into a different session.</s><s> (here is a question....i know about "snap-to" and the setting within a track.</s><s> but for multi-track, is there a way to tell the next track to start right after the prior track?</s><s> vs. trying to visually line it up with that yellow line that pops up.</s><s> just not sure i can make it seemless with that yellow line).</s><s> is there a command or something? -eq each track, and looks like i can save presets for the different halls. -seems like i can then select a track, right-click and "mix-down session to new file for selected track".</s><s> is that right? -so then i have a folder with each track, still in .wav having lost no quality, and i can then combine them into a cd with my own burning software. -and/or i can select them all and "mix-down session to new file for entire session".</s><s> and then re-import that file and put in chapter marks and burn a cd right in audition. 
</s><s>finally, i am pretty good with my audio mixing in pr pro and in the real world.</s><s> is there an faq or any tips on using the basic eq in audition?</s><s> or maybe a little reverb.</s><s> again, just tweaking live band audio, don't need to get crazy with flanger, etc.</s><s> i can imagine trying to make the bass less muddy, bring up the cymbals.</s><s> i saw that expand soundstage which looked interesting.

<s>if snapping is turned on and you have snap to clip turned on then as you slide the new clips around on different tracks they will snap to the end of the previous one even if it is on a different track. 
</s><s>the best eq to use, once you get your head round it, is the parametric eq since it gives you a huge number of options to tweak the sound either visually or manually.</s><s> the adjustable q makes it very versatile by allowing you to set very gentle wide sweeping eq or drastic sharp peaked dips or humps.

<s>no. audition 3 was still a windows-only programme.</s><s> the first version that could run on a mac was cs5.5 and (being honest) this was lacking quite a few features we take for granted.</s><s> cs6 is probably the first one to consder to replace what you're used to (or cc on a monthly subscription if you want the very latest--there are some nice extras added between cs6 and cc).

<s>possibly you haven't got all the parts of the recording chain set to the correct sample rate.</s><s> the blue yeti, windows sound and audition must all be set to the same sample rate.</s><s> with audacity windows is probably having to do a sample rate conversion to match the mic to the audio software.</s><s> doing that will cause quite a loss in sound quality.</s><s> audition is trying to do the correct thing when recording but saves the file with the incorrect sample rate info causing it to play back slowed down.

</s></quote>you don't with a blue yeti - they're firmly stuck at 48k 16 bit.</s><s> you've either got to resample everything else so that it's at this rate, or get a non-usb microphone, preamp and sound device - which would at least let you control the sample rate you record at.

<subject>Audition CS6 Mac Won't Play Audio Interface Preference Issue</subject>
<post author="Arkon76" timestamp="Aug 18, 2012 12:31 AM">
<s>hi im having some problems with audition cs6 mac.</s><s> i have the full master collection and only encounter this issue with audition. 
</s><s>on my macbook pro i use my internal speakers/audio or a vrm box audio interface, occasionally ill use a fasttrack pro to record.</s><s> my problem occurs after i use the audio interface.</s><s> when i next open audition set up for the built in speakers/audio and hit play, it says playing but nothing plays. 


</s><s>when i open audition after using a external interface going back to my built in macbook audio i get a pop warning that: 
</s><s>"your systems audio hardware settings have changed.</s><s> would you like to go review audition's audio hardware preferences?" 

i click yes, go to that everything is set for internal mac audio, 




hit play, says playing bottom left, then just sits there. 


i noticed today when it did this, that it if i go into the audio channel mapping preference, it shows what ever audio interface i used last on the output/not working on it.</s><s> i am unable to change theses settings. 


i reboot after changing audio interfaces, etc. 
i can delete my audition preference files in my user folder and it functions again, but that also entails rescanning all plugins which takes some time.

<s>i just found that removing machinespecificsettings.xml in the user/preferences/adobe/audition/5.0/ folder will get it to play again under the internal audio settings.</s><s> and when i look at channel mapping it shows the internal audio.

<s>try the following: - open edit > preferences > audio hardware settings - change the master clock setting from output to input, then click ok - repeat, but change it back to output.
