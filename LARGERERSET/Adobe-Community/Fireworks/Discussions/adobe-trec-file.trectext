<s>to see how color management might explain the shift from color 1 to color 2 in your graphic, consider the following experiment. 
</s><s>your original screenshot uses the icc profile "color lcd", which is your monitor's display profile.</s><s> this is a small-gamut color space and requires no actual color management because the image and the display occupy the same color space. 


</s><s>according to my online source, untagged images within mac os 10.8 are treated as if they have an srgb profile, so i'm going to change the attached profile of the image to "srgb iec61966-2.1"-as if it were an untagged image.</s><s> i want to preserve the image appearance, though, so i'll use photoshop's convert to profile, which also adjusts the numerical data contained within the png file. 
</s><s>the image looks the same, but the color space in which its defined is now larger because it's in srgb iec61966-2.1 instead of color lcd. 


</s><s>note: the graphic previews in this forum to do not include icc profiles, and some browsers do not support color management.</s><s> therefore, to normalize the appearance of all the images in this post, i reconverted the above image to color lcd. 
</s><s>now i'm going to pretend that the image is untagged or tagged incorrectly and assign it the original color lcd display profile.</s><s> remember, the image's numerical values were changed previously, so even though i'm simply attaching a color profile here, it's not going to look the same. 


</s><s>as you can see, the colors have become significantly duller.</s><s> color 1 in this graphic now strongly resembles color 2 in the original graphic. 


i don't know whether (or how) this experiment corresponds to what's happening in fireworks cs6 in mac's mountain lion os, but somewhere in the process of sampling color with the eyedropper tool and applying that color to an object, it's possible that a color translation like the above might be occurring.

<s>hey all, 
</s><s>according to ilmagodiloz86, the eyedropper color sampling bug that afflicts fireworks cs6 on mountain lion can be successfully worked around by first setting the monitor display profile to srgb iec61966-2.1 (under system preferences > displays > color), then launching fireworks, and then resetting the monitor display profile to its original setting (e.g., color lcd). 
</s><s>following is "proof of concept" that this workaround could be automated via applescript.</s><s> the idea is to use this script to launch fireworks instead of launching via the dock, the applications folder, etc.

<s>hi @groove25,

2) after reading you note about colors being safe when saved as swatches, i also realized that another way to know an hex value accurately is by using the info provided by the "window > info" panel. 


</s><s>aside from giving the current coordinates of the cursor within the canvas, it updates the hex value of the pixel where the cursor is currently in.</s><s> it's interesting how one feature in fireworks cs6 can get the accurate hex color (the info panel), yet the most important one, the color picker is not :/

<s>@alanrq: that's a great observation regarding the info panel!</s><s> if you hover over an object with the pointer tool, the info panel seems to provide accurate color values, yet if you hover over the same object using the color picker's eyedropper, you'll see distorted hex code values in the info panel. 
</s><s>this made me realize something else: the eyedropper tool itself seems unaffected by this bug!</s><s> am i mistaken about this?</s><s> not the eyedropper that appears within the color picker, but the eyedropper tool (i) as selected from the tool panel.</s><s> this is something i had overlooked, since this bug doesn't affect my operating system, but it's reminding me of the workaround suggested by rryanhayes79 in reply #19.</s><s> if so, this should make it relatively easy to sample colors from the canvas and apply them directly to other objects-and this would include sampling colors from semi-transparent objects. 
</s><s>this wouldn't diminish the annoyance factor of this particular bug, but it certainly could make it much less debilitating.</s><s> as long as you avoid sampling using the color picker's eyedropper tool, you should be ok.</s><s> (please let me know if i'm wrong about this.</s><s>)

<s>er zijn verscheidene redenen waarom het niet zoveel zin heeft om je druk te maken over zogenoemde "veilige" webkleuren: 
1) de 216 veilige webkleuren waren vroeger van belang toen schermen en videokaarten maximaal 256 kleuren op het scherm konden tonen.</s><s> de resterende kleuren waren vastgezet voor het besturingssysteem, zodat de interface elementen niet van kleur zouden veranderen.</s><s> tegenwoordig kan elke computer met gemak miljoenen kleuren weergeven. 
2) dithering werd gebruikt om het gemis van kleurtinten te simuleren.</s><s> dithering veroorzaakt echter grotere bestanden (meer informatie) dan een true colour verloop in png.</s><s> dit heeft ook nog te maken met het feit dat een 8bit formaat zoals gif een tabel van index kleuren moet opslaan naast de pixelinformatie, wat vaak een groter bestand als resultaat heeft. 
3) dithering en transparantie ziet er gewoon niet goed uit op de meeste schermen. 
4) de hoop dat de veilige webkleuren identiek zouden worden weergegeven op alle schermen en systemen is een utopie: het hangt van zoveel factoren af (hardware beperkingen, of het scherm kleurgecalibreerd is, de hoek van waar het scherm wordt bekeken, en zoveel meer) dat dit ook geen zin heeft. 
5) alle systemen kunnen alle kleurtonen weergeven.</s><s> png ondersteunt volle gedeelde transparantie - dus waarom zou je jezelf beperken tot gif 8bit met verlopen die geditherd zijn? 
6) tools zoals color quantizer kunnen png bestanden met volledige transparantie behouden en het aantal kleuren beperken van 16 to 4096 - geweldige kwaliteit met transparantie en een zeer goede bestandsgrootte. 
7) werken met dithering en veilige webkleuren kost uiteindelijk veel meer tijd, en levert slechtere kwaliteit op met vaak grotere bestanden. 
</s><s>tussen twee haakjes: vermijd gif tenzij je een kleine animatie moet tonen.</s><s> gebruik enkel png en jpg.</s><s> png levert altijd kleinere bestanden op dan gif - het enige probleem is dat adobe's programma's erg slecht zijn in het optimaliseren van png bestanden.</s><s> daarom is het een goed idee om colorquantizer in te zetten. http://x128.ho.ua/color-quantizer.html

<post author="Herbert2001" timestamp="Feb 26, 2014 2:55 PM">
<s>a difficult question to answer - i guess it depends on your preferred workflow and how you used fireworks.</s><s> fireworks, no matter how you looked at it, did get quite old in the teeth - workflows have changed quite a bit nowadays, and fw was not keeping up.</s><s> adobe is, i think, hoping to have photoshop replace it.</s><s> but that is not quite the best option right now. 
i found a good replacement in photoline, although it is still missing a couple of things crucial to web dev.</s><s> the good things are full svg support (import and export), export of (selected) layers, pages, good (real) vector tools, pixel alignment for vector layers, virtual copies of layers, excellent bitmap tools (comparable to ps), good guides, good alignment tools, patterns, a built-in procedural texture maker, document colours (newest beta), pixel view, anti-aliasing control per layer, great down-scaling algorithms, and so on.</s><s> i use qolor quantizer and riot for web graphics optimization. 
</s><s>the things missing are: slicing (which i never used anymore anyway - all layer based workflow now); symbols (though virtual layers work as a workaround); a general pixel alignment setting; no html/css output (which i never need anyway). 
</s><s>it can do much more than fireworks, but for pure web work it is still missing some things.</s><s> the devs are very open to suggestions, though, and so far have been adding a lot of useful web functionality.</s><s> it can only improve, in my opinion. 
</s><s>this works for me.</s><s> i also work with xara designer pro - which does have full html/css export if required.</s><s> there is also xara webdesigner (pro) (designer pro includes all that functionality). 
</s><s>soon the first version of evolveui will be out: http://tribaloid.com/ it sounds like the perfect fw replacement.</s><s> as a matter of fact, that project was started by disgruntled ex-fw users. 
</s><s>of course, you could switch to photoshop - but that is still too awkward for web work, in my opinion.</s><s> illustrator could also be an option.</s><s> even indesign can be used for working web prototypes.</s><s> but none of these are truly optimized for web work. 
</s><s>in short, do your own research; download the trial version, play around, and see if they do what you need in your web work.

<post author="Herbert2001" timestamp="Feb 22, 2014 11:48 AM">
<s>there are a couple of methods to achieve that punch-out effect: destructive and non-destructive ones.</s><s> i prefer the non-destructive option, since you can easily make changes if required. 
</s><s>the key is to create a duplicate of the image, and use the text as a mask object. 
</s><s>steps: 1) open an image 2) create a white rectangle in the same layer 3) create a new layer "mask" 4) in this layer type your text, create vector objects, and so on.</s><s> the colour is unimportant.</s><s> the content should fall inside the white rectangle.</s><s> 5) copy the image and place it in the mask layer at the very bottom.</s><s> 6) now select the objects and text you wish to punch out of the white rectangle.</s><s> 7) edit menu--> copy 8) select the duplicated image in the mask layer.</s><s> 9) edit menu--> paste as mask 10) hide the other objects in the mask layer, and presto: punched out effect. 
</s><s>if you want to move the punch out object, make sure to unlock the chain between the mask and the duplicated image object in the layer palette first.</s><s> then move the vector mask. 
</s><s>add a inner shadow for extra effect.</s><s> you can also replace the duplicated version with a slightly modified one (for example, a greyscale version). 
</s><s>the original objects can now be deleted, and try changing the text by clicking on the mask's text: it should still be editable.</s><s> however, i keep them around because editing the mask is slightly more work - just hide those for later use, if necessary. 
</s><s>i've created a quick example for you to examine.</s><s> download it at: www.estructor.biz/testje/punchout.png (this is a fw file, so save the file by right-mouse clicking and use "save as".</s><s> otherwise it opens in the browser. 
</s><s>also, you should have a look at the punch command for vector objects.</s><s> unfortunately, this does not work for bitmap images (though adding a bitmap pattern first to a vector object will still work). http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ssaj3dveu

<s>rudy, 
</s><s>you've already made progress in isolating the problem: it occurs in cs6 but not in cs5.</s><s> a good strategy would be to create a simple file in cs5, and then export it twice: first in cs5 and then again in cs6.</s><s> when it comes to html output, the answer should be somewhere in the code.</s><s> compare the two versions.</s><s> use dreamweaver's code view, or use the view source option that's available in most web browsers. 
i tried this myself, using a simple fireworks file containing just a single slice.</s><s> i used the default export options for both cs5 and cs6, then opened both html files in firefox and used its view source option. 
</s><s>this first graphic below shows the html output from cs5.</s><s> the second shows the html output from cs6. 


</s><s>see the difference?</s><s> the cs5 version is riddled with border="0" attributes on every img tag.</s><s> the cs6 version omits these attributes.</s><s> believe it or not, the cs6 version is probably better, from a contemporary coding standpoint.</s><s> the use of style attributes on html tags (as in cs5) is deprecated in favor of using css rules.</s><s> but then again, the use of slices, in general, is not a contemporary, standards-based method of web development-except, perhaps, in small doses. 
</s><s>the good news: if you're looking for an easy fix for this, i think i've got one for you.</s><s> within fireworks cs6, go to file > html setup... and then under the html style dropdown menu, select "generic xhtml" instead of dreamweaver xhtml.</s><s> (or choose generic html.</s><s>) this seems to bring back the border="0" attributes.</s><s> and once you've made this change, it should become the new default for all your fireworks cs6 documents. 


</s><s>the bad news: web development is a constantly moving target.</s><s> when creating web designs and converting them to code, you're creating instructions for a design rather than the design itself.</s><s> each web browser has a tendency to interpret those instructions slightly differently.</s><s> that's why internet explorer is showing you blue borders, where google chrome is not. 
i wouldn't trust fireworks as a resource for contemporary web development practices.</s><s> it's pretty much behind the times.</s><s> but that doesn't mean it's not good for some things-like design, or certain aspects of the development process.</s><s> and it's evolving, too. 
</s><s>much in line with linda's suggestion (and my own on your previous post), you could instead opt to address this problem by adding a small css declaration to the existing style tag within the head of your html document, something like this: 
<style type="text/css"> td img {display: block; border: 0;} </style> 
</s><s>however, this would require modifying the code directly-and may require a bit of tweaking and experimentation-which may not be your preference.</s><s> so my first suggestion might work better for you. 
</s><s>hope this helps.</s><s> my fee for this consultation will be two bottles of scotch.

glad you find that generic code set in html setup-that will work-..

<s>i can't understand why adobe treats its only wireframing and screendesign application this bad. the error in your screenshot exists now more than five years, and none of the two guys of the fireworks programming team seems to care. they probably only work the last week before a new release to update the splasscreen and icons. 
most of the innovation of the last 3 releases did come from third party extensions developers and user suggestions. that's fine but at least adobe should take care of the bugs. 
well, irony can help to overcome all this.

<s>don't put any hope in it that those bugs will be corrected this summer. all those exists since many years and nobody at the fireworks team seems to care about it. the workflow of fireworks would great and fast if the interface response could keep up with the speed of the user. 
i really doubt that the fireworks team is working on anything between new releases.</s><s> i know it is provocative to say that but it seems like that after every new release. if you look at the list of changes for cs6 it is quite apparent that most of them are small tweaks to improve the workflow but only one handles performance issues and only few actually correct drawing issues. and even the mentioned perforformance improvements sound like a workaround for somthing that is completely wrong at the core of fireworks.
