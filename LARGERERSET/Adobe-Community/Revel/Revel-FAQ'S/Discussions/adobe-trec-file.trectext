<post author="Pattie F" timestamp="Sep 3, 2013 10:23 AM">
<s>q: what can i do with revel on a windows based computer? 
a: you can access your revel account through a browser on a windows based computer (or any computer with a web browser). 
</s><s>revel clients are currently available for ipad, iphone and mac, and windows 8.</s><s> we also have plans to release revel for android in the future.</s><s> in the meantime, those users can access revel via a web browser at adoberevel.com. 
</s><s>if you are on the browser version of adoberevel.com, you will notice that it does not offer editing capabilities.</s><s> if you run revel this way, you do have some options for editing and getting photos to revel: 
you can edit in photoshop elements 11 or lightroom and upload to revel from there, you can use older versions of photoshop elements or photoshop or any other editing program and save the photos to your hard disk and then upload to revel.</s><s> you also have access to the photoshop.com photoshop express editor if you are not a user of elements or another editing program.
