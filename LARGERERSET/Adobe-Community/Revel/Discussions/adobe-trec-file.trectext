<s>brian- 
</s><s>it appears that you do not have enough free memory on your device to upload using revel.</s><s> generally, we recommend a minimum of 500 mb free space for revel to function well. 
</s><s>you can manually clear the cache to free up some space by going to library info -> clear cache for each available library.</s><s> this removes full sized files that were cached during upload or editing, as well as the larger preview sizes. 
</s><s>although you can move revel to the sd card, the photos and videos still remain in the phone memory.</s><s> only the app is on the sd card.</s><s> a warning should appear when your available memory is <500mb. the cache is purged as needed to maintain 2 gb of free space in the device.

<s>hi pattie

<s>lance, 
</s><s>the easiest way to upload your dslr photos is via adoberevel.com on a browser such as chrome.</s><s> you can drag and drop them into a library or directly into an album.</s><s> you can also use the mac app (no video support there yet) or the win8 app. 
</s><s>to upload from iphoto, open adobe revel on your mac , go to library view by clicking on a library name, and click the + button.</s><s> in the import photos dialog box, click photos in the media area of the list on the left.</s><s> select iphoto, and then select the photos you want to import.</s><s> click import to library.</s><s> pattie

<s>thanks for the quick reply patti - and my apologies for not stating i am on mac osx 10.9.</s><s> i wonder though, if you have actually followed the iphoto import process that you quoted recently? 
</s><s>in iphoto 7, apple changed the structure of the library folder so that it is a package instead of a folder, and that is not accessible via revel's osx app.</s><s> for future reference photos is now called pictures.</s><s> (see below) 
</s><s>when you select pictures via revel in the media area - the iphoto library is dimmed. 

</s><s>it is not available.</s><s> if you go in manually using the apple finder and then control click the iphoto library you can reveal the package contents and then navigate to the masters folder.</s><s> but that's not what i want, to manually open individual upload folders to find individual photos.</s><s> i see picturelife has added this ability to deal with iphoto's hiding structure.</s><s> is that what's needed for revel?

<s>i have been using the revel agent exclusively to upload pics to revel because i didn't want to confuse the synchronization program by moving files that it wouldn't be aware of.</s><s> however, you have mentioned use of the drag and drop process on adoberevel.com a couple of times so i gave it a try on my account that synchronized 8,000 of the 11,000 pictures.</s><s> it seems to have added 400 pictures using the drag and drop with out difficulty (i can see the new ones on my iphone app).</s><s> however, then the revel agent started uploading from revel to my pse library 1500 pictures Ð all duplicates of what i have.</s><s> so now my library is 12500 pictures.</s><s> sounds like i shouldn't mix drag and drop file transfers with revel agent file transfers Ð it confuses the agent.</s><s> i turned off the agent and can't turn it back on or it keeps adding duplicates. 


</s><s>all the files are jpegs, mp4s and .mov's. 


</s><s>when i created an album i did it within pse12. 


</s><s>so.</s><s> i can't seem to get revel agent to fully synchronize or keep uptodate when it thinks it is synchronized (i.e.</s><s> i add files to the library and it won't add it to revel).</s><s> i can add files manually. 


</s><s>any suggestions?</s><s> should i create a third account and try to synchronize again?</s><s> i feel like turning the commuter off or suspending it during the synchronization may cause revel agent to think it is uptodate when it is not.</s><s> so for the intial synchronization i could try to keep it on for 8 days-.</s><s> hard to do but possible i think (family gets in the way).</s><s> but then there is no guarantee that future shut downs wouldn't mess up the synchronization anyway.</s><s> and the whole benefit of revel is being able to keep libraries synchronized when doing edits.</s><s> otherwise i should just use dropbox or something.

</s><s>if i turn on sync (the revel agent) using my first revel account (the one that got to 8000 of 11000 files synchronized) because the agent gets busy duplicating files within pse12 (copying from revel back to pse12).</s><s> so i can't do your test of synchronization with it.</s><s> however if i log into my other revel account (2,000 of 11,000) it is typically stuck (claiming to be 'uptodate').</s><s> however, today it seems to be synchronizing. 


</s><s>now if i look at the same revel account (second one) in firefox it is really hard to figure out if new pics are coming it.</s><s> i get pages and pages of "videos" (see screen shot Ð if you hover over, it says "preparing video" is has for weeks) as i scroll down and then couple random pics and then i get some pics that were scanned in in 1990's but revel thinks are from sept 2013. then i get some pics that are dates correctly- i think they start at 2006. so if i add a picture i'm not sure i'll easily see it..it will show up in the middle of a long list of pics (why are these "videos" always at the top when i sort by newest first?</s><s>).</s><s> anyway, the account thinks it is synchronizing right now and i don't see new pics showing up (even when refresh the screen)-.</s><s> it would be nice for revel-online to give a total pic count so i could see it increasing. 


</s><s>if i check the iphone app version of revel then i can see the number of pictures slowly increasing- so that's a good sign, it seems to restarted synchronizing (and not in the wrong direction).</s><s> i can't see the new pictures, i assume because it is adding pictures in the list between 2006 and 2013 (or pictures it thinks are from 2013).</s><s> yes it's the date thing is weird, it is like revel is not consistent in its use of date fields in the metadata Ð importing with one field and then displaying with data from another field. 


</s><s>oh, i just thought of something.</s><s> i bet that the second revel account is updating now because there are 5000 duplicate pictures- its just duplicating them in my other account!</s><s> yep that's what is happening- its really hard to see because revel app doesn't put the duplicate pics side by side- but i can see two duplicates about 4 screens apart. 


</s><s>so the first thing i would like help with is if you could find an automated system to get rid of the 5000 duplicate pictures that were created by revel in the synchronization process.</s><s> then i think we should start again with a fresh account- 


</s><s>sorry for the long email. 


</s><s>thanks for your help,

<s>hi vaishali 


</s><s>i spent a bunch of time with the pse12 and revel on the weekend.</s><s> if you remember, i turned the revel agent off while i added the rest of my pictures to revel by dropping on the revel web page. 


</s><s>when i turned revel agent on, it spent over 12 hours in the "detecting changes" mode.</s><s> then within one hour it seemed to increase the total number of files within pse from 15,811 to 21, 789.</s><s> visually you can see that nearly every photo in pse12 is now duplicated.</s><s> then it steadily started adding pictures to revel on line Ð from 10,624 to 11,268.</s><s> i suspect most of these were duplicates.</s><s> when i started deleting duplicates (100's of them) in pse12 the revel number dropped to 11,097 but then with time start climbing again to 12,234.</s><s> then it got stuck here for 12 hour even though it was saying "updating 81 files".</s><s> when i rebooted the agent ( i had deleted a bunch of files on pse12 in the mean time).</s><s> the number dropped to 12,102 but then started climbing again to 12,195.</s><s> then i stopped the agent again because i had discovered some other interesting things and i didn't want any more duplicates.</s><s> the pse 12 numbers did settle out at 20,907. 


</s><s>recap: my original pse12 file number was about 11000.</s><s> by using the revel agent i added 9,000 pictures to my catalog these must be duplicates or triplicates.</s><s> the revel agent seems to be trying to replicate those 9,000 duplicates in revel on line with disregard to duplicate pictures. 


i started investigating the file structure of my pictures wondering where these duplicates were being stored.</s><s> attached is a pictorial view of the size of various file folders where i keep my pictures (file: "recent photos files structure").</s><s> i admit the organization system is awful- but what caught my eye is the syncdb folders.</s><s> what are in them?</s><s> why are there two of them? 


</s><s>furthermore, attached is an explorer view of my file structure.</s><s> why are there two catalog 11?</s><s> that last file folder holds 12,000 pictures and is 8.7 gb big.</s><s> this may be a major source of my duplicate files. 


</s><s>when i use a third-party good picture finding program it identifies 9000 duplicate pictures not including the ones in the revel file folder, i.e just within that first "recent photos file structure" ie. c:\public\pictures\all photos since sept 2013.</s><s> it identifies the majority of the duplicate files to be various repetitive folders within the directory structure that it would appear i created by being negligent in my file organizing and backing up.</s><s> however, about 20% seem to be duplicates from the syncdb folders.</s><s> see attached. 


</s><s>when i look at duplicates within pse12, i didn't find an exception to one file being from the revel directory and one file being from my "c:\..\all photos..".</s><s> even when third party duplicate photo finder says both files come from "c:\..\all photos.." pse12 reports the duplicate is from c:\..\revel\..\my catalog 1 1.</s><s> pse seems to be suppressing the duplicates in c:\...\all photos- but can't do the same with the revel files. 


</s><s>there are photos that do not have a duplicate.</s><s> they are sometimes from c:\..\all photos.. or from c\..\revel\my catalog.</s><s> this is likely a result of indiscriminate deleting i did on the weekend.</s><s> btw, the c:\revel photos are of lesser quality with less metadata. 


</s><s>there are 47,000 files in c:\..\all photos. 
</s><s>there are 21,000 files in the pse12 catalog (19500 photos, 1500 videos) 
</s><s>there are 12, 000 files in revel online 
there are 12,000 files in c:\..\revel\my catalog.</s><s> (11,500 photos) 
</s><s>there are 9,000 duplicate photos in c:\..\all photos.</s><s> (independently identified, not a calculation, 20,000 photos total) 
</s><s>there are 1,900 duplicate photos in c:\..\revel\my catalog 
i started with 11,000 files in pse12.- i don't recall very many duplicates. 


</s><s>you might say 11,000 originally plus 9,000 duplicates equals the 21,000 in the catalog (plus videos and some error) but the duplicates add only 4,500 files (9,000 pairs of original plus duplicate) 


</s><s>vaishali : how do i return to one copy of each picture on my c:\, one copy of each picture in revel online and one copy of each picture registered in the pse12 catalog? 


</s><s>what is the potential complication/disadvantage of putting all 11,000 photos in one folder? 


</s><s>what are all those syncdb and revel files doing duplicating the pictures on my harddrive? 


</s><s>thanks for any help,

<s>ian, is this revel account migrated from ps.com or you had been using it with elements 11 for import/export workflow with elements 11?also you are using the same converted catalog in e12 with same revel account?

<s>thanks for the reply. 


no i didn't migrate from photoshop.com 


</s><s>yes, i was adding to revel by two methods.</s><s> i was very careful to not add duplicates.</s><s> revel agent works sequentially by file date so its easy to see where i can add without causing duplicates.</s><s> i started adding files using a second method because revel agent stopped, claiming the system was 'uptodate'.</s><s> i suspect that the agent got confused when i added the pictures by a second method and that started the duplication.</s><s> however, i think it should be smarter than that.</s><s> i am also pretty sure it started to make duplicates of pictures that were added using the agent.</s><s> how else do i go from a real size of 8,000 pics to 22,000? 


</s><s>so the core problem was the revel agent stopped syncing.</s><s> the work-around started a host of problems. 


</s><s>in order to remove the duplicates, it is ideal to collect and store all my pictures in one file.</s><s> can you think of any down side of 8000 files in a folder from an os or a pse12 perspective?
