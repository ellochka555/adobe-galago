<s>ok-- here's an idea.</s><s> why don't you take the slideshow you have for all your top-level catalogs and move them into content holders.</s><s> you should name the content holder exactly what the catalog name is... so move your slideshow for the bedroom catalog to a content holder called "slider-bedroom".</s><s> then, in your overall shop layout, beneath the breadcrumbs and before the products you can insert your content holder but use the {tag_name} which will output the catalog name to call your content holder by it's name. 
</s><s>in your overall shop layout use {module_contentholder, name="slider-{tag_name}"}.</s><s> if you were looking at the bedroom catalog page and there was a content holder named "bedroom" then i think it should work.</s><s> do this for all your slideshows-- move them to a content holder with the name of the catalog they are for.</s><s> then, you don't have to use your custom pages for the catalog and you can also put your products in the right catalog so that you end up having the slideshow at the top of the main catalog page. 
</s><s>if you don't have a content holder setup for, say, the barstools sub-category then the {module_contentholder} should fail silently if it can't find a matching content holder by name. 
</s><s>when you've got that content holder module in your overall shop layout then you should be ok to use those top level category pages. 
i also suppose your next objective would be to get rid of or customize the "this catalog has no products" and "this catalog has no sub-catalogs"... the following jquery can help you do that.</s><s> put it in "jquery.main.js": 
--- 
(function($){ $(document).ready(function() { var noproductsmessage = "your no products message"; var nosubcatalogmessage = "your no sub-catalogs message";  $("body").html( $("body").html() .replace(/this catalog has no products\./gi, noproductsmessage) .replace(/this catalog has no sub-catalogs\./gi, nosubcatalogmessage) ); }); })(jquery); 

--- 
change the variables in the function above to reflect your custom message or make it an empty string: "" if you want to remove the text instead of replace it with something else.

<s>that jquery i gave you should only replace the message that appears when you don't have sub-catalogs and products on a page.</s><s> bc by default will print a message that says "this catalog has no products." or "this catalog has no sub-catalogs." the javascript i gave you will replace that phrase with a message you want or if you leave the variables as empty strings it will remove those messages.

my suggestion is to comment out in your code anywhere you see "jquery.noconflict();" you can comment out a line by putting // in front of the line of javascript.</s><s> comment out every place you see that line-- in your page templates and in all your .js files you reference in your site.</s><s> if you comment it out you can uncomment it later just in case that's not the issue.

<s>the reason this code might be interfering with your breadcrumbs has everything to do with javascript errors.</s><s> the fiddle i showed you doesn't need to be included in your site-- it's just an example of what's going wrong with your site right now.</s><s> if you use "jquery.noconflict();" the way you are it negates the $ and jquery variables you can normally use to access jquery methods.</s><s> it's just an example of the way you are using it is actually breaking all your javascript calls to jquery. 
</s><s>"jquery.noconflict();" is in your head element in your page templates and also on line 1 of jquery.main.js.</s><s> so on line 1 of jquery.main.js this: 
jquery.noconflict(); 
becomes: 
//jquery.noconflict(); 
and in your page templates this: 
<script type="text/javascript"> jquery.noconflict(); jquery(document).ready(function() { jquery('.productpopletsitem a').attr('onclick','').attr('rel',''); jquery('.productpopletsitem a').click(function(e){ e.preventdefault(); jquery('.image p img').attr('src', jquery(this).attr('href')); }); }); </script>

</s><s>that should make it so your slideshows and the rest of your javascripts work again-- right now they aren't working and it doesn't really have to do with the script i provided you. 
</s><s>but-- you don't want to add that script to your catalog.html template because it was repeating that script for every catalog-- we only need that script called once per page so you can simply add it to the end of jquery.main.js file.</s><s> trust me-- that script itself has nothing to do with the breadcrumbs acting up.</s><s> do these steps and get back to me.

<s>hi thegoshawman, Ê instead of solely having vat as a selectable option from the 'destination state' drop-down, i recommend replacing this with a list of states/counties that exist within england. Ê so what you will need to do is log into the admin console of your site > ecommerce > tax codes and delete the 'vat' option.</s><s> then create a new tax option for each state in england and assign a tax rate of 20% to it. Ê therefore whenever a customer specifies the 'united kingdom' as their destination country, they can then select a list of states from the 'destination state' drop-down and still have a tax of 20% assigned to their order (equivalent to vat). Ê thanks, matt.

<subject>How to grab CSS styles from Muse and insert them into Business Catalyst Blog and News</subject>
<post author="PeMarroquin" timestamp="Jan 26, 2014 2:16 PM">
<s>hey guys!</s><s> i got into a problem, hope you can give me a hand! 
a couple of months ago i saw this tutorial: http://tv.adobe.com/watch/learn-business-catalyst/adding-business-cata lyst-features-to-your-muse-sites/ where it showed how to grab css styles from muse and insert them into business catalyst to give styles to the blog and same to the news. 
</s><s>basically what it was it's you set in muse a "mockup page" where you show with muse native text how the blog and news would look like, then you preview the page in your browser and give "inspect element" to the text body, the event text and such and such.</s><s> when "inspect element" showed you div and styles you then would grab the styles that were set to that text, the main thing is that inside the main div it would go like: <h3 id="u2526-3" class="h3-page-subheading" and then bodytext-sourcesanspro="be the best you can be".</s><s> so back in business catalyst you would go to develop tab and got to the css sheet of the modules which is: "modulestylesheet.css" and set the following: .</s><s>h3 page subheading and the css styles, saying give this styles to all subheading in the page that is h3. 
</s><s>now muse gave you that specifications, the thing is that it doesn't give it anymore, it gives the styles but it doesn give weather it's h3 subheading or h5 heading, so i don't know how to tell business catalyst to give the styles to what class...</s><s> does anyone know how to fix this. 
a friend of mine gave me an alternative which was modify the "styles" from the module layout, the thing is that in the module layout you can only use websafe fonts and doing it by css styles it respected if there was typekit fonts involved. 
i really would aprecciate the help guys!</s><s> thanks!</s><s>

<s>hello, 
</s><s>i am still deciding whether to convert to bc or not and this is my major stumbling block. 
i would like to set the shipping options to correctly set shipping prices dependent on a uk postcode entered and weight of product.</s><s> (but not using the preset integrated companies such as ups) 
</s><s>this taken from the bc instructions: 
the following steps describe the checkout process the customer need to take when using the integrated shipping: when your customer adds the product to the cart and goes to the shopping cart, the system will look at the product and display the shipping options that apply to that product. * your customer will then select the shipping option and if that shipping option is an integrated shipping option the system will render the zip code/postcode field.</s><s> your customer then enters the destination zip code and the system will then contact the shipping provider and retrieve the shipping options available for that destination. ** the shipping option is displayed as a radio button and the customer needs to select the radio button in order to apply the shipping to the order.</s><s> note that if the shipping provider supports all services option, such as fedex, we retrieve all options for that destination and customer can then select the appropriate radio button.</s><s> customer can then check out and finalise the purchase. 

</s><s>questions: 
</s><s>1) *is it not possible to render this postcode field when the shipping is "user defined" and not just when an integreated shipping company is chosen? 
2) ** can we not link to a custom external file that would return the price depending on the postcode entered (i already have a php based page from a previous website that returns either zone1, zone or zone 3 - this combined with shipping weight equals the shipping price). 
3) is bc planning on integrating with royal mail (uk postal service)? 
4) am i being stupid?</s><s> is there an obvious way of using the existing settings?

<s>i can't currently find a way in bc's reports area to generate a report on the number of times a literature item was downloaded.</s><s> so, if it were up to me, i'd use google analytics and their event tracking to track how many times a piece of literature is downloaded.</s><s> technically, you can't really tell if it's been downloaded officially, but you could hookup some javascript on the link that leads to the literature download. 
</s><s>if you don't have google analytics tracking code installed, do so first.</s><s> here's some info on how to install the google analytics code: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/#qui ckstart 
once you have the google analytics code installed and verified, not it's time to add the event tracking feature.</s><s> for my instructions i'm also going to assume you have jquery already loaded on your site. 
</s><s>when you insert the media downloads/literature module into the page you should see the default markup consists of a paragraph tag with the class of "literature-container" and inside each of those paragraphs is the link to download the literature.</s><s> if we use jquery, the script should look like this: 
<script type="text/javascript"> jquery(document).ready(function() { jquery(".literature-container a").each(function() { var litname = jquery(this).text(); litname = jquery.trim(litname); 


jquery(this).click(function() { console.log(litname); _gaq.push(['_trackevent', 'media', 'download', litname]); }); }); }); </script> 
</s><s>this jquery script goes and finds every literature link and when that link is clicked will push an event to the _gaq variable and track the click as an event that you can find and report on using google analytics. 
bc's reporting tools are basic and decent but if you want anything custom, i usually look to google analytics or other analytics offerings. 
</s><s>you can see my demo of this script in action at http://ignitemybusiness.com/demos/literature-event-tracking although technically, you cannot tell it works until the next day when you check your google analytics events report.

{tag_amount} amount paid {tag_authorizationcode} authorization code as the payment gateway returned {tag_errormessage} error message associated with the payment {tag_invoicenumber} invoice number {tag_orderid} internal id associated with the purchase {tag_paymentstatus} status of payment (for example, success, failed, or pending) how are you using them?</s><s> they should render but they have to be on the receipt buy layout and not on a custom page or anything.

<subject>Getting back to a secure zone Landing Page</subject>
<post author="buzzvick" timestamp="Jan 2, 2014 3:11 AM">
<s>thnaks liam, that works well.</s><s> i managed to display the secure zone's link as i need for now. 
</s><s>next step for this link is to display it as something other than just the name of the zone it links to, eg "zone a" changes to "click here for admin" 
</s><s>using {module_subscriptions,false,false,,true}, i get this on screen: 
.</s><s> {"securezonesubscriptionlist": {"entityid": 30425224,"subscriptions": [{"zonename": "agent a","zoneid": "6317",},]}}, so i assume the zoneid number is the crucial thing here. 
i gather a custom javascript is required to extract/parse this id, and replace this into the above "click here..." link, but i know little more than that.</s><s> can you point me in the right direction as to how i could change this to suit.</s><s> thanks

<subject>Display Web App Item Based on Subscription</subject>
<post author="buzzvick" timestamp="Dec 30, 2013 2:05 AM">
<s>hi guys i need to build a page which displays particular web app items based on the user's secure zone access status.</s><s> the goal is for a user to log in and view only the items he is assigned to.</s><s> eg agent a views property a, agent b views property b, agent c views property c and d, etc etc. agents can be subscribed to multiple secure zones and hence see multiple properties. 
</s><s>there are few ways i've tried but none have quite hit the mark.... 
</s><s>option 1 add the item to it's respective secure zone.</s><s> this is fine, however the list view of the (secured) item still displays, and it isn't until the user clicks the item, that he is prompted to log in so he can view the item's detail-view.</s><s> as new properties will be continually added by the client, this is the easiest way by far, but the process really doesn't the objective the way it is.</s><s> if the list view of the item can be hidden from the (unsubribed) user, this is an ideal fix. 
</s><s>option 2.</s><s> secure the actual page (/projects.htm) containing the list view so no properties at all are displayed until the user logs in.</s><s> as in option 1, logging in will simply display all properties, even those the agent is not subscribed to. 
</s><s>option 3.</s><s> kiyuco tutorial re displaying content based on secure zone.</s><s> looks good but would involve the client having to add/edit snippets of javascript/css, so isn't really an ideal solution to offer.

<s>hey again-- 
it looks like your nivo slider might not work with the latest jquery library which you are using on your site.</s><s> typically, jquery deprecates some features/methods in newer versions and some javascript libraries like the nivo slider don't update their scripts.</s><s> in this case, nivo is trying to use the .live() jquery method which was deprecated (but you can still use it) up through jquery 1.8.3.</s><s> in jquery 1.9 and above it's completely removed from the library so any script using that method will fail. 
</s><s>right now you are using the latest jquery version (1.10.2) by referencing: 
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"></script> 
in your page templates.</s><s> this might not be a good idea.</s><s> by referencing that file you'll always be using the latest stable version but jquery will also be updating that file on it's own to the latest version for you so your jquery version will change when they change that file.</s><s> i'd stick to a specific version all the time and not reference the "latest" jquery like you are using.</s><s> and, as i said, you can't use any jquery library over 1.9 since it won't have the .live() method that nivo requiers so you can probably safely switch to jquery 1.8.3 which is still pretty current and will work with the nivo slider.</s><s> update the "jquery-latest.min.js" reference to: 
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.3.min.js"></script> 
</s><s>word of note-- keep an eye out for other scripts that might break.</s><s> most jquery dependant scripts will likely work with v1.8.3 but you can't be sure so replace your jquery library like i describe and then make sure nothing else is broken on the site. 
</s><s>also-- side note-- you've got some 404 (file not found) errors coming up on your site which slows page load as the browser tries to load those files and they don't exist.</s><s> the files in question are: 
/nivo-slider/themes/orman/orman.css /nivo-slider/themes/pascal/pascal.css /stylesheets/images/loading.gif 
you've got references to the .</s><s>css files in your page templates' head element so either remove these references so there's no 404 errors for them or upload them to your site.</s><s> the loading.gif image is likely being called by the nivo slider so upload a loading.gif file to the /stylesheets/images/ folder.</s><s> you can use the one from the nivo library or grab your own from a site like http://ajaxload.info 
in the future, you can easily see if there are javascript errors or 404 errors for images, css or javascript assets by using the javascript console in chrome's developer tools.</s><s> you should be using chrome to view/test your websites in the first place (you probably are) and you can just use these shortcuts to launch the javascript console: 
ctrl + shift + j cmd + opt + j good luck.</s><s> sites coming along nicely.

<s>it looks like you are using bc's default menu system and i don't think that supports any levels past the first two levels.Ê you'll have to transition your menu to use another menu framework that does support mutiple levels of submenus.Ê you'll have to remove the javascript after your main menu layout that bc adds in there by default so that there's no conflict.Ê you should be able to replace the bc javascript by going to the "develop" tab and navigating to /moduletemplates/menu/default and editing "container.html".Ê you can use the superfish menu framework which support multiple levels in dropdown navigation.Ê replace the javascript after the html markup on that page with this: Ê <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/superfish/1.7.3/superfish.min.js"></script> <script> Ê jquery(document).ready(function() { ÊÊÊÊ jquery("#mymenu1 > ul").addclass("sf-menu").superfish(); Ê }); </script> Ê Ê and then download and reference this css file so that your menu is using superfish's css styles: http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/superfish/1.7.3/superfish.css Ê i can't guarantee that those superfish css rules won't adversely affect your current menu styles so you might need to play with your own css to fix those issues.Ê for docs on superfish visit: http://users.tpg.com.au/j_birch/plugins/superfish/

<s>the only way currently to tell that you are on a sub-catalog page is to use some javascript to see if there are 3 or more links inside your p.breadcrumbs element.</s><s> if there are 3 or more links in there you'll be in a subcatalog so we'll check to see if there are 3 or more breadcrumb links and if so, we'll add a class via javascript to your body tag.</s><s> then, we'll write some css that says when the body has a class of "subcat" to hide the catalogue list. 
</s><s>in your main.js file, goto the end and put this in there: 
(function($){ $(document).ready(function() { var crumbs = $("p.breadcrumbs").find("a").length; if ( crumbs >= 3 ) { $("body").addclass("subcat"); } }); })(jquery);

<s>hi philip, please do not take my bluntness the wrong way here, just getting to the point.</s><s> really is worth nothing posting the code unformted like this when it is also not in the page/template and thus environment it is not working under.</s><s> i am just guessing as others would to the problem even with your post likely you got a javascript error or something else.</s><s> with things like this you really need to post the url so people can see it in action, test it, use things like the developer toolbar in firefox to see if there is javascript errors etc.

<s>hi liam, 
</s><s>i don't mind your bluntness at all but i am not a developer and do not normally frequent these forums.</s><s> therefore, i am not aware of the etiquette to be used. 
</s><s>if you copy the code and save as an html file you will find that it works as advertised in all broswers.</s><s> however, as i said in my post, when it is applied to a bc site it does not work.</s><s> i did not get any errors and only a change in the colour of the submit button when i clicked on it. 
</s><s>however, the url is http://www.fundadvisers.eu/investment-outlook. 
btw, it is "...there are javascript errors..."

<s>hi paul, it is not etiquette, you want help, would love to help but you need to allow people to like i mentioned, that code on it's own just in its own file probably works, that is very likely not the issue.</s><s> considering how bc works with pages, templates, how you have those implemented in your site, how you have inserted that code into a page or template and implemented it is what matters.</s><s> conflicting scripts, missing code, posted in editor with invalid html having it changed by the editor...</s><s> there are lots of reasons for issues to occur. Ê it is a bit like taking taking something out of context, not really meaningful or can be taken the wrong way if used out of context. Ê in terms of your issue.</s><s> html errors.</s><s> your form if you use say firebug you can see has closed itself off right away and does not have the form elements inside thus nothing to submit of function correctly due to the html issues.</s><s> go through the errors http://validator.w3.org/check?verbose=1&uri=http%3a%2f%2fwww.fundadvis ers.eu%2finvestment-outlook ensure your forms is outputting correctly and you should be good to go/ Ê just missed off the "is any" thats all.</s><s> but i get the intention of the comment.</s><s> noted.</s><s>
