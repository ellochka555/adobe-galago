<post author="Spencer_wes" timestamp="Jan 5, 2013 5:56 AM">
<s>hi there, 
i need to show a form when an item is out of stock on the product details page.</s><s> with the grouping function it was easy class="stockout-{tag_instock}" would call a class to hide ("stockout-1") or to display ("stockout-0"). 
</s><s>however, with attributes you need to use the {tag_instock, true} tag which doesn't simply output a 0 or 1!</s><s> it however outputs the number of stock items within <span> tags.</s><s> this prevents me from using this css trick to show and hide content. 
eg: <span class="catinstock catinstock_6190581">0</span> 
</s><s>i've explored various options ranging from jquery to content holders but nothing seems to work.</s><s> if you could suggest anything i would be really grateful! 

</s><s>maybe a json script?

<s>hey wes. Ê you could hide the span using css, then tell javascript/jquery to also hide the form if the span has a 0, if it has any other number leave as is?</s><s> javascript numerics is pretty handy, you can do all sorts with it. Ê kind regards, justin

<s>hi wes, Ê this is untested, but you could check initially on page load as well as each time the add to cart button is clicked. Ê you really just need to re-run the code whenever the value changes. Ê something like this perhaps: http://jsfiddle.net/m6gzb/ Ê you can manually test it by changing the span value then pressing run.</s><s> i have not tested this live in bc to make sure it works with the add to cart button.</s><s> bc is known for killing dom in ecommerce. Ê i've also made a couple of assumptions like your add to cart button being the standard bc image and inside the quantity ul li.Ê you might need to adjust a couple of things to make it work with your setup. Ê replace the span in jsfiddle with {tag_instock,true} when you test it in bc. Ê let me know if that works for you. Ê cheers, justin

<s>hey justin, 
</s><s>thanks again mate for your help!</s><s> i've put your script into the product details page of my site: 
http://www.kiph.co.za/all-products/save-water-graphic-tee 
if the product loads an initial stock value of 0 the script works perfectly, however if i change the attribute variation to eg: "small" size nothing happens. 
unlike the product grouping dropdown, the new attribute dropdown doesn't refresh the page...

<s>hey wes, Ê of course, i forgot about the new inventory control!</s><s> so you need the code to run when the <select> is clicked.
