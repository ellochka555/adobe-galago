<s>we've noticed on some of our sites that there seems to be a lot of international traffic.</s><s> while it isn't necessarily harming our sites in any way, it does throw off our data reports.</s><s> most of the time it seems to happen as a large spike in a single day.</s><s> almost all of our sites are small, local (maine) businesses, so international traffic doesn't really make sense anyway.</s><s> for example, one of our sites, a local hardware store, has almost as many visits from ukraine as it does from america.

<subject>100% Bounce Rate Issue on Web Apps in Google Analytics</subject>
<post author="Pebble Design" timestamp="Feb 26, 2014 9:53 PM">
<s>hi, we've noticed that across all bc sites, most web app items are reporting a highly inflated bounce rate, which increases the overall bounce rate of the site.</s><s> this is happening on some pages also, but the biggest concern is web apps.</s><s> we would like to know if anybody else is experiencing this issue.</s><s> i've checked some other sites not on bc and the same issue isn't happening near as much. 
</s><s>screenshots below are taken from the analytics account of http://www.beautifulaccommodation.com.</s><s> if you check the code you will notice that it is running cloudflare, however this has only very recently been installed, and the issue exists on all bc sites, cloudflare or no. 


</s><s>this screenshot shows an overview of some properties.</s><s> as you can see, the bounce rate is at 100%.</s><s> if you look at the first property on the list as an example, you can clearly see that there are 169 pageviews, with an average time of 00:56 on page and an exit rate of 13.61%.</s><s> these stats to me look great, so why is the bounce rate at 100%?</s><s> this is not possible.</s><s> i haven't included a screenshot of all properties because there are hundreds, but the bounce rate remains quite high across all web app items, and at the bottom of the scale some properties drop to have a 0% bounce rate. 


</s><s>this next screenshot shows a detailed view of the first property.</s><s> you can see that the bounce rate is either at 0%, or 100%, no inbetween - which is the case with most web app items.</s><s> the bounce rate should vary each day.</s><s> i also find it strange that a flat bounce rate of 0% with a few spikes of 100% can result in a 100% bounce rate. 
</s><s>keep in mind that this is not an isolated issue, and it happening across every one of our 100+ bc sites.</s><s> and this is not a new thing, i've noticed it for years but a client has now raising concerns and it would be nice to find out why it's happening. 
</s><s>on another site that we redesigned last year, we added many more web apps for the client to use.</s><s> checking the stats however, there is a huge increase in bounce rate between the old and new sites - i'm guessing from the increase in web apps used. 
</s><s>so... what's the go? 
</s><s>cheers, klaye

<subject>difference between google analytics and bc report?</subject>
<post author="Sidney%20Mitchell" timestamp="Jul 17, 2012 9:47 AM">
<s>hi, 
</s><s>our analytics work fundamentally differently like other services (google, etc) so there can be discrepancies in the data between them. 
</s><s>for example, google analytics counts a page visit as a 30 minute session.</s><s> if the person is inactive for 31 minutes and then clicks again, it counts as 2 visits. 
</s><s>as for bc individual visits are given a 1 hour session before they time out and are counted as a new visitor.</s><s> unique visitors are kept unique via a cookie for up to 1 year. 
</s><s>every time a user interacts with the site this is refreshed (so if you view a page once and then 30 minutes later, the timeout would not occur until 1hr 30 min after you viewed the page the first time). 
</s><s>google relies on javascript to record usage whilst bc does it each time it serves content.</s><s> we use a number of methodologies to detect bots including user-agent string, repetitive hits from same ip or location amongst others.</s><s> there's the reason why the numbers are different and cannot be compared.</s><s> you can compare the results provided either by business catalyst for a long period or by google analytics, but not one method with the other. 
</s><s>whilst there may be differences in the exact number of reported visits (as google analytics and bc have different 'count' processes and bot handling mechanism's) the main use for visitor statistics should be to view trends over time, which you should find are similar between ga and bc reporting. 
</s><s>if needing us to look into your report further please log a ticket and we'll advise.

<subject>Track No. of times link to external site is clicked on a page</subject>
<post author="mario_gudelj" timestamp="Mar 6, 2012 10:16 PM">
<s>question: 

</s><s>our client strongly promotes another business on their site with a large button to click through to that business' url, which then opens in a new window.</s><s> is there any way in the reporting section of bc that our client can prove how many times visitors have clicked this link?</s><s> i.e.</s><s> a way that they can show how frequently referrals have come from them? 
</s><s>this kind of link click through tracking is obviously possible in enewsletters - but what about on actual webpages? 

</s><s>answer: 
</s><s>one way you could do it is by utilising the ad rotator module. 
</s><s>you can add the html to it then add the module code to your page and it will report on total impressions and click throughs to the link specified. 
</s><s>then you can also have data on the conversion rate. 
</s><s>another way would be to send your visitor to a page on your site that is redirected to the external site automatically.</s><s> that way you can still track it.

<s>not really the right mindset.</s><s> if your having the make people aware of them in this manner it is not really that effective and if you need to do this there are issues with the website itself.

<post author="Alex%20Pavelescu" timestamp="Jan 31, 2013 2:31 AM">
<s>hi, 
</s><s>there are a number of reasons why an e-mail could fail to be received.</s><s> being marked as spam, thus either ending up in the junk folder or being retained by an external e-mail filtering service such as postini, soft or hard bounces, etc. still, keep in mind that, as long as the event process (event booking >> event date >> follow-up e-mails) doesn't extend over a considerable period of time (a period in which ip addresses may be blackisted, thus causing an e-mail that initialy would have been delivered, to be classified as junk), a user could have problems receiving even the booking confirmation.</s><s> so basically there's a chance that whoever failed to receive the follow-up e-mail also had an issue with the booking confirmation, his interaction with the event itself potentially being compromised. 
</s><s>in any case, the booking e-mails are not intended to provide the functionality you described.</s><s> a workaround you could consider would be to link the event booking process to a customer annyversary date, and use that to fire an html based campaign.</s><s> the reports generated for this module will provide access to this type of information.</s><s> just keep in mind that these campaigns are limited to a specific number of e-mails per month, with the option of purchasing more.

<post author="michaelbt27" timestamp="Oct 1, 2012 12:48 PM">
<s>i have a registration page.</s><s> when completed the user is taken directly to their "profile." the problem is the url ends up being http://www.domain.com/default.aspx?pageid=10694802&eid=24515501&cid=51 69686 where http://www.domain.com/default.aspx?pageid=10694802 is stactic across any registration.</s><s> because this isn't a static page, how would someone place in an adwords conversion code, or any other code for that matter to measure conversion rates. 
i can only think the solution is to direct the user to a page that uses a specific template after registration.</s><s> on that page would have to be a button that can take them to their "profile." not the best user experience.

<s>hi michael, 
</s><s>indeed that sounds like an immediate approach, to remove the damage added to the user experience you could add a meta redirect, thus linking the user directly to his profile page. something like <meta content="0;url=http://link_to_the_profile_page" http-equiv="refresh" />
