</s><s>1. it's page title has no effect or difference with page title, same with products and web apps etc.</s><s> 2. using that wraps the body content in full html even if there is a template selected.</s><s> 3. if you have meta from the previous means of meta data using this will add other meta tags, not replace them so you end up duplication.</s><s> 4. if you add a description change/clear and re-add it again it keeps the existing html from the last time and just adds another meta so you end up with two meta tags the same, one with content, one with empty content.

<s>hey mate. 
1.</s><s> add a title in there, you will see it wont change.</s><s> this causes confusion.</s><s> 2. view the page source: 
this is not good of course when your using a template and plays havoc with custom designs in a variety of ways with how the system behaves. 
2. delete the meta description you added, save the page and remove it again.</s><s> you will see that the system does this: 
you can see that the system makes a blank descript and a 2nd one with the changed content.</s><s> search engines will read the first and error because you have two.</s><s> not good of course 
3.</s><s> if you have meta added from the old meta method and a client uses this in version 3 it doubles up and you can end up with two keywords, two meta and two titles. 
</s><s>it is a real mess.</s><s> try use it for blogs and products and you get the same problems as well as a couple of extra ones for products. 
i sent all these situations direct to the engineers on the problems. 
</s><s>as an aside you have title which is important right at the top on pages but then it is hidden away for products and catalogs.</s><s> if you do not add it for a product then it takes the catalogs name or title which is bad.</s><s> ok it does something but because it is hidden away actual users of sites forget to do it.

<s>title tags & seo 
</s><s>i worked fine for me but if you want to be sure you can put you own header information into the html in your page.</s><s> i'm going to ramble on because other people may find this information useful 
things have change with search engines and the only thing that is important is your title information in the header and how you write it. 
</s><s>first let's talk about meta tags.</s><s> meta elements are html or xhtml elements used to provide information about a web page for the search engines and website users. 
</s><s>such elements must be placed as tags in the head section of a html document.</s><s> these elements are the: 
title tag, description. 
</s><s>keywords (no one uses these anymore and you can get spam "points" for overuse of keywords on bing and google, so just forget them.</s><s> if you have keyword stuffed "spammy" ones, you probably want to fix those.</s><s>) 


</s><s>for now it's back to the basics with seo!</s><s> and nothing is more basically important to a site than properly written title tags.</s><s> you know the ones that used to appear in the little blue bars in your browsers.</s><s> most modern browsers try to conceal these, though that doesn't stop them being helpful! 
</s><s>so what is a title tag?</s><s> why is it important to seo, and how do you write the darn things?</s><s> a title tag is the most important single tag in your page.</s><s> it tells the search engines what your page is about.</s><s> it is still vitally important to paid or organic seo strategy. 
</s><s>think of title tags like the title of the chapter of a book.</s><s> it tells people and search engines what your page is about. 
</s><s>title tags are also part of what makes people decide whether to visit your site when it shows up in the search results.</s><s> the title tag should contain important keywords to help the search engine determine what the page is about. 
</s><s>note: every experienced seo has their own unique methods to doing this, so i'm going to give you best practices along with some of my methods 
when you do a search on google, the information that shows up is in the title tag so you need to write title tags for humans but format them for search engines.</s><s> every page on your site has an opportunity to rank high on search engines for a particular keyword, quick checklist 
when you're writing your title tag what do you need to know?</s><s> here's a quick checklist with some tips on how to write optimized title tags: 
length: title tags should be a maximum of 70 characters long, including spaces. 
</s><s>keyword placement: your most important words (keywords) need to be first in your title tag, with your least important words being last in the title tag (most to least).</s><s> keyword separation: use pipes | to separate important (keyword) phrases (no commas, underscores, dashes or any other punctuation unless the keyword is written that way). 
</s><s>wording: keep your important phrases short and simple.</s><s> leave out words that would make it read like a sentence.</s><s> (e.g., and, if, but, then, etc.</s><s>) 
</s><s>company name: if your company name is not part of the important (keyword) phrases, put it at the end of the title tag or leave it out.</s><s> if it is part of your important words, put it as the first words in the title tag.</s><s> some seos will tell you to leave it out.</s><s> you can leave it in for branding purposes – so people will see the brand and click.</s><s> this isn't valid for all sites. 
</s><s>don't duplicate title tags: they must be written differently for every page.</s><s> don't mass replicate your title tags. 
</s><s>make it relevant: title tags must be written to be descriptive of the content on the page.</s><s> (e.g., the about page would be: 


</s><s>about | important keywords | company name 
</s><s>or 
</s><s>important keywords | about us | company name.</s><s> 
</s><s>google & title tags 
</s><s>sometimes google doesn't like your title tag.</s><s> in fact, sometimes google thinks it can pick a better one, so it will rewrite the tag for you.</s><s> there are several places it might get this information, most of them you won't prefer to one you crafted yourself. 

</s><s>while there isn't any assurance your title tag won't be replaced, make sure you write a title tag that is page related, content descriptive, short and sweet, and not keyword stuffed.</s><s> this is your one defense. 
</s><s>keyword stuffed title tags 
</s><s>you've probably come across badly written title tags that try to rank for everything or repeat a word over and over.</s><s> keyword stuffing is the worst offense when it comes to title tags.</s><s> (you will be penalize) 
</s><s>say your site is trying to rank for blue bells and yellow bells.</s><s> many times you will see the main keyword repeated multiple times across the title tag.</s><s> it might appear like this: 
blue bells, yellow bells, all types of bells | bells bells and more | doors.com 
this is bad title tag writing.</s><s> you don't need to repeatedly write the keyword.</s><s> google especially can pick up the keywords like your eyes can read them, so you would best to rewrite this as 
blue & yellow bells | doorbells | doors.com 
we removed the extra words, combined the products (if possible you would split these products to separate pages, a blue and a yellow, but this isn't always feasible or desirable) and added a category keyword which would appear in the middle of the title tag on all doorbell related page titles, then end it with the domain name (again this is for branding purposes – there are also good reasons to not do this, it depends on the seo). 
</s><s>now our title tag is short, sweet, simple, and to the point.</s><s> we have also categorized it and added in branding for good measure. 
</s><s>we also took out the word "and" and replaced it with an ampersand (&) so that you don't accidentally relate the two items and make google think you want people who are looking for blue and yellow bells. 
</s><s>and there you go, a basic lesson in title tag writing.</s><s> this can be the most challenging and fun part of any seo's work!</s><s> or should that be "inbound marketer's" work? 
</s><s>some title tag writing examples 
</s><s>let's look at a few examples of writing title tags with actual examples. 
</s><s>if your important words (keywords) were "charlie sheen" and "winning" your title tag would be written in that order: 
charlie sheen winning 
charlie sheen would be the first words in the tag. 
</s><s>now what if we had more than one set of words?</s><s> what if my keywords were "charlie sheen winning" and "tiger's blood"?</s><s> your title tag would still be written with "charlie sheen winning" as the first words in the tag.</s><s> then you would add a pipe | and "tiger's blood" as the second phrase: 
charlie sheen winning | tiger's blood 
don't use hyphens, underscores, commas or any other type of character – just pipes. 
</s><s>now what if we had more than one set of words and a company name we were not worried about optimizing for (the company name was not part of the reputation issue).</s><s> if my words were "charlie sheen winning" and "tiger's blood" and "cbs", you would separate these three phrases with pipes, with cbs last and farthest from the beginning, which google sees as the least important phrase: 
charlie sheen winning | tiger's blood | cbs 
the company name can be repeated in every title tag as long as it as not part of the important words and appears at the far right end of the title tag. 
</s><s>what about sentences?</s><s> couldn't you just write a sentence such as "charlie sheen says winning and tiger's blood and gets cbs riled up"?</s><s> you could, but those extra words like "says", "and", and "riled", dilute your important words and make them less important to content, so best to keep it short, simple, and clear.</s><s> leave out the extra words. 
</s><s>once you're finish with all of this its time to submit you pages to the search engines.</s><s> you will need to create an xml & html sitemap. 
</s><s>webassist surveyor – build and submit html and xml sitemaps in dreamweaver 

http://www.justdreamweaver.com/blog/2008/07/webassist-surveyor-build-h tml-and-xml-sitemaps-in-dreamweaver/ 
don't forget to check each page ranking monthly and make the necessary tweaks to your title information as needed.</s><s> (each page needs to rank for a unique key word on your site) 
</s><s>i'm going to stop now but that's only the start of organic search engine optimization.

<s>sorry to be a negative post here but that's a lot of out dated information there. some of it wrong, some of it outdated and some of that a bit odd.</s><s> also copy and paste from a few places it seems 
here is a statement from one of the recent seo google events just a few weeks ago: 
often a single title might not be the best one to show for all queries for a page, so our algorithms may generate alternative titles to make it easier for our users to recognize relevant pages.</s><s> if you recently changed the content of your page and its title, it may take some time for our algorithms to notice it.</s><s> while we can't guarantee that your new title will be used, if it's descriptive, informative, there's a fair chance it will be.

<s>this is great liam, things have slightly changed in the system since you created this but it is actually quite straight forward once the custom field is setup correctly.</s><s> i found after a while i had to attach the custom field to one of the 'entities' being contacts, companies, cases, opportunities, orders. 
</s><s>if i created the field but not attach it then it would not show up when trying to extract the data form the 'update user details form' from within the secure zone module.

<s>hi liam   thanks for replying.</s><s> it is meant to be an easy to use wywsiwyg editor but really you need coding knowledge to be able to create forms other than one long list   i wanted to have the same design ease as in muse or form central   i spent a long time on chat session with support and it seems the best solution is to have contact forms created with muse widget but still to use form central for things like gift voucher order forms   the contact form details can be added to an existing mailing list in bc through using reports>custom reports>add customer report> customers and cases> select the fields you want like customer name, default address type, email 1 >then choose filter 1 case subject = then type the name of the muse form you want the data from + select from custom crm form filter drop down list the same muse form you want. then his generate report.</s><s> it will give you a report of all customers who have completed that form. you can then select 'add customers to' and choose the mailing list you have created and they will be added   it is a very long process to do somethig that should integrate straight from muse forms into whatever mailing list you have pre chosen.</s><s> eg. when desiging a form in muse where it has option to choose the email address it send results to, it should also have an option to choose the bc mailing list you would like their name added to would be logical.   i hope this can be sorted out in the near future with muse as the rest of the program i do like.

<s>not when it comes to this sort of thing.</s><s> your heading into the proper realms of websites and customability and that involes coding.</s><s> thats what my job is and why i get paid 
i am suprised support would have advised you to do that, is that because you will only use drag and drop creation, is that what you said?</s><s> they would have advised using bc to get the data in and through bc. 
</s><s>to add a mailing list you just add that to the form and you can have that pre-selected with checked="checked" to that input checkbox. 
</s><s>in terms of the reports, i know bc quite well, i know how they work 
you need to understand that while muse is always improving and i appreciate the teams work and it has helped a lot of graphic designers build some form of website...</s><s> it is a point and click tool, it is not really going to build websites for you, it is only a stepping stone and there is the point where you need to start learning the trade.

i have a client that only wanted to display prices and allow visitors to place orders if they are a registrated secure zone user.</s><s> they also wanted the ability to "authorize" each user manually so what i did was add an extended crm form to a secure zone registration form that contained a dropdown list of sales representatives that the secure zone user is required to select and a hidden field that by default sets the secure zone user's "authorization" to false and once an admin logs in to the adminconsole and "authorizes" the secure zone user, then the secure zone user can view the prices and place orders. 
</s><s>everything works as expected, but now they are requesting to send out workflow notifications to only a specific admin based on the selected sales respresentative upon registration. 
</s><s>is this possible? 
</s><s>here's a link to the secure zone registration form - http://www.realfeelproducts.com/users/join 
many thanks in advance.

<post author="Florin%20Carlig" timestamp="Feb 4, 2014 4:50 AM">
<s>hi josef, 
</s><s>to display prices only to registered users you can use a catalog setting - show prices only to existing users, it's available for each catalog, just expand the more details panel.</s><s> or put the catalog in the secure zone altogether, but this way you'll hide the whole thing, not just price and order placement: http://forums.adobe.com/message/6081805#6081805 
to "moderate" the secure zone access, you can just get the user to fill in the username and password and not subscribe them to any secure zone.</s><s> then, review each enquiry and manually grant them access.</s><s> you can also choose which workflow gets executed by using this workaround: http://helpx.adobe.com/business-catalyst/partner/create-workflow-notif ication.html#id_22857

<s>craftyalien is correct.</s><s> we have a regular hosting solution and then we also use the business catalyst solution.</s><s> we offer a storefront option for both.</s><s> when giving a client the option and explaining the differences, they always baulk at the thought of not having their own secure certificate on their site.</s><s> this is before we even design the site according to the concept you mentioned earlier.</s><s> it is the clients and site visitor's perception that counts, not the developers.</s><s> while i agree that the site is just as secure (if not more secure) the problem is the client and the user have an issue with it no matter how well the site is planned and developed.</s><s> i believe business catalyst needs to truly considering opening up to allowing ssl installations for each site.

<s>i know this is an older thread and hopefully a post will "ping" those that are on it to see if this can be resurrected.</s><s> i'd like to encourage abc to offer the ability (even if this is at an additional cost to the customer) to allow us to install their own ssl certificate on the site so that we can have https://www.sitename.com. 
i understand that by using the shared ssl cert, abc saves the customer from having to purchase their own certifcate, which is nice.</s><s> however, from a branding perspective, if a client wants to offer a https:// expeirence for their visitors across the entire site, this is not possible without making the url change (and breaking the brand) when the site loads. 
</s><s>there could be a variety of reasons why a client would want to have https://www.sitename.com showing when the page loads.</s><s> they may be collecting user name and password information on their home page to allow members to log in to a secure zone and want to ensure that visitors informtion is protected.</s><s> the client could also be in a sensitive industry such as helathcare, insurance or banking and offer visitors (customers) the assurance that they are on a secure site.</s><s> whatver the case, it would be nice to have this as an option, and may open up an additional revenue stream for abc as i have several customers that would be willing to pay for this enhancement. 
i do a lot of work with community banks and find the abc system is a great, easy to use and simple (yet powerful) cms that enables the marketing managers to keep their site updated.</s><s> we have got "around" the site-wide ssl issue with some internal landing pages where customers can enter login inforation to access their online banking accounts (which is on a different system, not on abc).</s><s> however, if this is a requiremnet that the bank has to be "full https" on their site, we cannot go with the abc system and end up developing on a different system.</s><s> i'd prefer to have all of my clients using abc, making it easier for me to supprot and more economical for the client. 
</s><s>fingers crossed this can be revisited and something can be done that will create a win-win here for everone.
