<subject>Social Media buttons moving on large product layout</subject>

<s>hi, i'm having problems with social media buttons on the large products page.</s><s> i have the like and tweet buttons in a list displayed inline but when i click the add to cart button the media buttons disappear then reappear out of alignment and overlapping.</s><s> i've contacted bc support who said : 
</s><s>" the temporary disappearance of the social media module when a product is added to the cart occurs because when a product is added to the cart, and ajax refresh is performed on the large product layout.</s><s> as a refresh is performed, these modules are required to be reloaded thus why you encounter this. 
</s><s>the only current workaround that does not require custom coding is to place the social media module outside of the large product layout.</s><s> for example, you will notice if you place the social media module tag in the template assigned to the product instead, then this issue will not occur.</s><s> " 


</s><s>so i've cut the div containing the modules from my large product layout 

<div class="socialmediabuttons"> <ul> <li>{module_facebooklike,moduletemplategroup="default",language="en_us ",url="{tag_itemurl_withhost}",layout="standard",showfaces="true",widt h="300",verb="like",font="",colorscheme="light",send=""}</li> <li>{module_twittertweet,moduletemplategroup="default",language="en",u rl="{tag_itemurl_withhost}",count="vertical",text="",via="",related="" ,counturl=""}</li> </ul> </div> 


and put it into the product description of one of my products, but i've got the same problem. 
</s><s>i've also tried putting the list items into a custom tag and that gave the same result as well.

<s>hi all, 
</s><s>just before leaving work last night it was drawn to my attention all our pages were returning the 'no start page' error.</s><s> a quick google and a chat online with cs and i can get around the bug by manually updating all the pages in bc. it wasn't ideal, but it worked, and i left them with a page that wasn't updated so adobe can investigate the issue which they admitted was nothing to do with us, or our website. 
</s><s>to my dissappointment this morning i discover the news i'm publishing isn't displaying, so off i trott to cs online chat, again. 
</s><s>the 'fix' turns out to be a simple one; all i have to do is set the release date a few days prior on each and every new item we publish into the content holder.</s><s> this came with no apology and a very abrupt end to the chat, and when you've already got 2000 odd pieces of news on the site it would be nice if they could acknowledge the fact you're familiar with publishing new copy. 
i have always found the cs at adobe to be very polite and helpful, but rarely, if ever do you get anything in the form of an apology, and this latest episode of events has left me with even less confidence in bc/adobe and a bitter taste. 
</s><s>our site isn't visited by thouasands a day (google analytics suggest 400-600 unique visitors on a day), but it is nethertheless important to us and our business and a lot of time and effort has gone into making it - even if we need to release the facelift i have been working on.

<s>hi stewart,

i think it's because of a bc update that caused the error - we have the save cart contents issue too... what's worse for us is a wholesaler adds items to carts then comes back and is logged out but cart is still in wholesale (50% discount pricing) and then they get free shipping which we only offer to consumers.</s><s> very annoying plus it's resulted in a lot of embarrassing calls to our wholesale customers advising them our website screwed up and no they can't have free shipping..

<s>hi franco,   with how business catalyst works, you can achieve the following scenario:   from e-mail will be a unique address setup within the workflow associated to the webform.</s><s> reply-to will be the customer's e-mail, as entered in the form.</s><s> subject will be: default is: "workflow notification - the webform name" but you can customize this to contain just a system tag.</s><s> out of the available system tags, you can use "tag_worfklow name" which will output the name of the workflow assigned.</s><s> since you can have multiple workflows available, if you name each workflow as the respective product, than you can achieve your goal here, assuming the subject can take a fixed, generic form   body will contain the field message but will also contain the rest of the form summary.</s><s> to will be a different contact or set of contacts, as you can actually trigger separate workflow based on user selection, as seen here: http://helpx.adobe.com/tiness-catalyst/partner/create-workflow-notific ation.html#id_22857     here's a small graphic to better explain the above: http://screencasteu.worldsecuresystems.com/ap/webforms_workflows.jpg   kind regards, alex

<s>hi franco, 
</s><s>here's what happens when i hit reply to a workflow notification i received after filling in a basic webform: http://prntscr.com/306coz 
this is because our system marks the customer's e-mail (that he entered in the webform) as the "reply-to" address, as seen here: http://prntscr.com/306dp2 this is an automated process. 
</s><s>so when a user submits a bc form, he needs to add his e-mail address in a mandatory field (let's assume he used john.smith@something.com).</s><s> when you receive the associated workflow notification via e-mail, replying to that e-mail will send the message to the customer that submitted the webform (john.smith@something.com)

<s>had a moment and had to try to fix it.

</s><s>the original method recommended by simon had the email in two parts, however, this method could have problems.</s><s> (see liam's post on that thread.</s><s>) this idea was liam's and i tried it and it worked. 
i realized the form had a few errors.</s><s> i also modified the javascript from what you had originally to what i am using on other sites.</s><s> this code i tested and it worked.

<subject>An alternative to using Recaptcha or Image Verification</subject>
<post author="Simon Darby" timestamp="Dec 29, 2013 8:29 PM">
<s>some clients may not want to use recaptcha for some reason (like it looks awful and can be hard to read for some customers). 
i came up with this after getting spam using the standard bc image verification (which looks nice but wasn't really working for me).</s><s> the spam stopped immediately (for now) possibly because it stopped spammers pasting in an email address. 
</s><s>how it works 
in this example i simply require the customer to input their email address in two parts, leaving out the @ symbol. 
</s><s>the two parts are joined using javascript and sent to the hidden input with the id 'emailaddress'. 
</s><s>you will need to add two new text inputs to your form.</s><s> you do not need to create these new input fields in the bc form builder.</s><s> just hand code them into the existing or new form.</s><s> remember this form has no recaptcha or image verification (if you already have recaptcha or image verification modules in your form, go back to the bc form builder and remove, then get the new html to work with). 
<!-- form inputs -> <input type="text" id="emailname" name="emailname" maxlength="255" placeholder="john" oninput="join_email();" onpaste="join_email();" /> <span class="add-on">@</span> <input type="text" id="domainname" name="domainname" maxlength="255" placeholder="example.com" oninput="join_email();" onpaste="join_email();" /> <input type="hidden" name="emailaddress" id="emailaddress" class="cat_textbox" maxlength="255" /> 
</s><s>note that the standard bc form input for email address has its input type changed to 'hidden'. 
<!-- form function --> <script type="text/javascript"> function join_email() { var emailname = document.getelementbyid('emailname').value; var domainname = document.getelementbyid('domainname').value; document.getelementbyid('emailaddress').value = emailname+'@'+domainname; } </script> 
</s><s>place this script just above the standard bc form validation scripts inside the form tags. 
i don't expect it's full proof, but it's another option to consider.</s><s> working example here: http://dotsilo.com/contact.html
