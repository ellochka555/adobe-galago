<subject>How to set product Id for event booking order?</subject>
<post author="ColinAus" timestamp="Feb 16, 2014 11:31 AM">
<s>we take paid bookings for a number of events through the year.</s><s> since the event booking information is identical for every event (only the event details change), we have implemented this by embedding the html from a standardised web form into each event's details section. 
</s><s>however, when the event booking is submitted by the customer, business catalyst creates a product whose name is constructed as {form name}/{event name} to correspond to this event.</s><s> this product is referenced in the crm order for this event that is linked to the customer.</s><s> this means we get a separate product for each event type. 
</s><s>the problem is that the product code that is assigned to the event booking product is the id of the web form that was used to process the event (ie. the form embedded in the event detail).</s><s> since we use the same web form for multiple events we are now seeing duplicate product codes. 
i would like to create a common product for all event bookings and pass this product id when posting the form on submit of the event booking.</s><s> the reason for a single booking product is to simplify the synchronisation to our accounting system - otherwise we need to create a new product in the accounting system every time we add a new event. 
</s><s>is there a query parameter i can include on the form's action url or as an input field to the form that controls the product id and / or the product name that will be used for the booking order? 
</s><s>the only other solution i can think of to solve this challenge is to create a unique web form - event combination for every single event.</s><s> this is not a great solution due to the unnecessary duplication that this will involve - i would rather re-use a common piece of code.

<subject>How are CRM orders created for web form payments on webapp detail page</subject>
<post author="ColinAus" timestamp="Jan 26, 2014 11:08 PM">
<s>i am trying to understand exactly what is happening on a web app and associated payment forms that were built for us by a 3rd party developer. 
</s><s>here is the situation.</s><s> we have a webapp named student.</s><s> items for this webapp are created by customers.</s><s> no payment is required on item creation. 
</s><s>when the customer wishes to enroll their student, they click a button/link that takes them to the detail page for the student webapp.</s><s> this page has a web form that includes credit card payment information. 
</s><s>when the page is submitted, an autoresponder email is sent to the customer with their enrollment/order details (controlled by the webapp settings?</s><s>) and their is an admin email that is sent according to the workflow settings of the web form (i think). 
</s><s>so far so good. 
</s><s>when i look in the crm - orders i see orders that are created in relation to this payment.</s><s> the product that is listed as the single order item seems to have the same name as the web form used to submit the payment.</s><s> i can click through to this product in the e-commerce products listing. 
</s><s>we have something similar for event bookings and there are a number of orders that also have similar product names to the events that were being paid for. 
</s><s>it seems like these products all have the same (numeric) product code. 
</s><s>my questions are: 
is this product automatically created?</s><s> is that how the duplicate product codes have come about?</s><s> do i actually need (or should i) create specific products to associate with these orders?</s><s> if i do create products for these web form payments, how do i tell the web form to use this product id for the order that is created? 
</s><s>is there anything else that i should know or be doing differently for this to work correctly? 
</s><s>lastly, we are synchronising with saasu via onesaas.</s><s> saasu is our product master so it would be handy to be able to create the products in saasu first if we really do need a product on this order.</s><s> in that case i would like to be able to specify the product code or id for the order. 
</s><s>i'm not sure if i really need or want separate product codes for each event or webapp order that is placed.</s><s> there is no inventory (obviously) and probably not much benefit in tracking these separately in the accounting system (other than to reconcile that a payment was received and it was associated with a certain "order"). 
</s><s>thanks in advance for any help or advice you can give me.

<s>one the primary things i learnt at uni is the object oriented modal of design and development, mvc etc. seperation of the function, display, data being a fundemental point to develop and all the benifits of that. 
</s><s>also, your html code will weigh more, i.e.</s><s> a web page riddled with similar code will have a kb size that is a lot larger than necessary.</s><s> the inline script and css will make the source more dense, search engines have to sift through it to find your actual content.</s><s> your html code will never be truely cached but the external dependencies, such as the css and javascript files, will be cached by the visitor's web browser after the first visit – this means that instead of loading a lot of superfluous html code for every page in your web site the visitor visits, it will quickly retrieve all style and interaction locally from the web browser cache and thus improve perfomance further. 
no fall back interaction, and harder to manage, correct and update along with poor attrinbute accessability.</s><s> having your scripting in one central location makes your development time more effecient, working on new aspects of the site has no effect on the live site, functions can be wrote once called many times and only when needed.</s><s> object coding in javascript improves performance, management, use and more also. 
</s><s>with these in mind the page load is just longer with inline scripting and the event handling is poorer and then coupled with the other elments mentioned above. 
</s><s>just better done right bc has runs gzip, you can optimise your code and the server caching of css, script, image files and the browser it just all leads to better perfomance of your site which is also increasingly something google wants to see to rank you well.

<s>adam, to start you off in terms of basics....   have a functions file (i wrote a guide on the adobe site but bc took their guide section down as it was another place.</s><s> i got it saved and i will put it as a guide on these forums soon!</s><s>) where you write your functions.</s><s> each function for a job.   have a dom.js file where you run the dom in jquery.</s><s> one time call.</s><s> in here you can call a function when to run it.   so say you have the home page slider but that is only home page.   you wrap the function in an if statement that basically is..   if element exists (.length) then run this function.</s><s> if the element does not exist the function does not run.   you can lazy load and call scripts, create script library to run (on our sites we have one extra .js at the bottom called to do all our magic) and add plugins easily to a site, lazy load them so they do not run every time you load a page even if not needed....   you can progress to convert everything into objects not just functions.   you can progress still to use classes in javascript..   jquery has great features to aid in all these areas.....   so much you can do to optimise not just your sites and scripts but how you operate running these methods.   the oo apporach to your work is modular design and development just means you can do more for less and sites are just better.

<s>liam, as i read through your document and thought about the merits of lazy loading, a question arose.</s><s> how do you handle jquery plugins?</s><s> currently, i paste them directly into the top portion of my scripts.js file, then call them from within my object at the bottom portion of the file.</s><s> to illustrate, this represents my current file structure (though i included the 'if' statements around my functions in a new attempt at make this better at lazy loading): 
/* plugins */ 
this represents a minimized version of a jquery plugin, pasted directly into my scripts.js file. 
</s><s>here is another. 
</s><s>and another. 

/* my scripts */ 
jquery.noconflict(); 
function scriptlist() {
     var $ = jquery;
     var engine = {
          utils : {
              function1 : function() {

</s><s>     }
</s><s>};
</s><s>jquery('body').on('click.productsubmitinput',function() {
      jquery.ready(scriptlist());
});
scriptlist(); 
now, there are probably many things wrong with what i wrote, and you are free to comment on them, but my questions are: is it bad to include the plugins at the top of this file?</s><s> should they, instead, be contained within my scriptlist() somehow?</s><s> should i have conditions set on their loading?

<s>okay, so i think i have most of it working. my data list is coming in, and points are getting plotted.</s><s> however, a lot of the points in the same area are the same latitude and longitude.</s><s> what gives?</s><s> i've been reading that the bc only has a limited cache of geocoded addresses?</s><s> why doesn't bc hit google's geocoder when a new web app entry is created or updated? 
</s><s>i've been playing with google's geocoder for getting better lat/long's for each address, and it is in fact getting more accurate results, but i'd rather not hit the geocoder for roughly a hundred points every time a user hits my page.</s><s> i've read that google has a limit on how many geocoder hits can be made per day. 
</s><s>any ideas?
