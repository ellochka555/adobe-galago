<s>apart from the number of requests to have a crm export option that exports all the data in the same format as the import template which is kind of a pretty basic requirement long overdue, a constant issue i face is the fact that unlike the products import function, there is no ability to actually import a list of crm records you wish to delete.

<subject>Identical email address limitation - anybody found a workaround?</subject>
<post author="Tim | Digica" timestamp="Aug 10, 2012 7:38 PM">
<s>bc support have stated that the system cannot currently allow identical email addresses for multiple customers even if you choose to use a unique your id.</s><s> no identical email addresses can be used across multiple records, end of story. 
i am aware that "senior" bc parters have raised this issue before and i'm pleased it's being considered at that level, however that doesn't help me now. 
</s><s>we are developing a website for a tennis club and the idea is for the system to help with purchasing and renewal of memberships.</s><s> however, we've hit a major snag, many people who belong to a club use the same email address; couples, families etc and because bc won't allow identical email address we don't know how to handle this issue.</s><s> btw, we're not talking about one or two instances here, many, many people use the same email address. 
</s><s>here are a few examples of where we hit the wall: 
scenario 1a 
a couple (that use a single email address) decide to purchase membership online at the same time, they enter 2 x adult memberships.</s><s> when they get to the check out, because if the limitation we can only, register an email address against one of their names, so what should be a simple case of collecting details for both members so we can hold them as separate records, becomes a headache as we now need to come up with some type of "couples" option in the system where a couple will buy 2x adult memberships as one product with a "main member" and some kind of "attached member".</s><s> this presets a number of issues especially when running reports, it all becomes unnecessarily complex and adds unnecessary overheads. 
</s><s>scenario 1b 
</s><s>the same as 1a except that it's a family, so 2 adults and 3 kids for example.</s><s> we could use the "main" and "attached" solution, but that means we don't get individual records for the 2nd adult and none for the kids.</s><s> this is a bit easier as the family category exists already, whereas the club doesn't have (or necessarily want) a couples category. 

</s><s>scenario 2 
</s><s>one partner in couple (that use a single email address) buys membership today- no issue here as this is processed as single adult.</s><s> 6 months later however the other partner decides they also want to join- they get to the checkout and enter their (joint) email address and the bc system either produces an error message saying "the email address is already being used in the system, please use another one" or it will overwrite the existing record (i'm not actually sure what the bc system will do).

<s>hello deb and others with the same issue, 
no, there is no suitable workaround for this issue.</s><s> i was hoping that bc would at least allow a database check to see if the email address already exists, but bc tell me that can't be done.</s><s> which means worst case "scenario 2" is a reality and has already happened on numerous occasions.</s><s> and this means that you have to keep an eagle eye on everything and all records need to be manually checked for accuracy.</s><s> this in turn means the automation is quite limited, which unfortunately defeats much of what we were aiming for. 
</s><s>there may be other ways of achieving all this on bc, but no one has to date shed any real light on such a solution--lots of 'yes you can...', but no real concrete methods outlined.</s><s> perhaps if we had a bigger budget we could have solved it?</s><s> but then again maybe we wouldn't have, maybe the 'identical email issue' for this type of application is just a bc killer. 
</s><s>if you're looking to automate club membership i'd say look for another platform/solution.</s><s> if you don't mind doing some manual checking and adjusting, then bc is probably an ok solution for the money. 
</s><s>our solution in the end btw was to have 'primary' and 'secondary' members.</s><s> both get their own db record but only the primary member gets an email address.</s><s> we created custom crms that gave us all the primary and secondary member info including a field where the secondary members are listed on the primary members record so you can see at a glance who belongs to who (again this has to be manually checked and changed when secondary members change).</s><s> all active members are then subscribed to a secure zone, where the membership expiry date is set.</s><s> if a membership lapses then that member is no longer active.</s><s> using secure zones we were able to get ok reports showing all active members.</s><s> the automatic membership expiry email notices (anniversaries) at least work well, the anniversary date is set to the same as the membership expiry. 
</s><s>hope this helps.

<s>ok... thanks to those who offered assistance and i now feel somewhat a goose but then not altogether. Ê bc in its usual style of help documentation, are not at all clear in their explanation of how the unique id (which is actually the field 'external id' in th crm under the misc section).</s><s> below is the description extracted from the import template Ê the above columns represent all the available columns that can be imported using the standard contact import feature.</s><s> columns do not need to contain information but they must be present on the page, especially if a proceeding column contains information.</s><s> if your organization uses its own unique identification number to differentiate between customers then use the your id column.</s><s> if a value is present in this column then it will serve as the unique identifier.</s><s> this means if the contact was previously imported and it is being re-imported then his or her details are updated, otherwise a new contact record is created regardless of whether a similar contact already exists in the system.</s><s> if the your id column is not used then contacts are generally identified by their email address.</s><s> the minimum requirement to import a contact into the system is that either your id, email address, fullname, firstname or last name must be present on a single row.</s><s> if these values are missing the the row is not imported and the import will move to the next row.</s><s> if you don't provide your id nor an email address and only a name then the contact is added each time regardless of whether a similar one already exists in the system. Ê now my understanding is that if you have used the your id then being the unique identifier and as such all future imports would have to use that...</s><s> well no this isn't the case at all. Ê if you import a set of records that all use the your id you can simply update those same records with just the email address - you don't need to your id or external id at all!</s><s>!</s><s>!Ê so what is the purpose of this field at all?</s><s> i have no idea myself as it can't be reported, it can't be exported, it can't be referenced - in fact the only way you will ever see it is to open the crm record and expand the misc details and buried at the bottom you will find it.</s><s> now that is what i call an undocumented feature ! Ê so end of it all is - my concerns all proved baseless and you don't have to concern yourself with the external / your id field no matter what the customer does. Ê my advice - forget this field exists and don't bother trying to use it unless you might happen to be interfacing into some 3rd party system through pai's as this seems to be the only use i can think of for it.

<s>as a postscript... if you are also dealing with usernames on your crm records for secure zone access there is another catch... 
</s><s>all is fine if you users have email addresses but yes i have a client who has a large number of members who need access but don't have email addresses... 
</s><s>when you import these the username becomes the unique identifier - yes you can add 2 contact records with teh same name, no email, no external id but with different usernames. 
</s><s>your problem occurs if you try to do an import update on such records - if you use the same username the import will fail (and yes 1 record error message at a time on the import so check your data first). 
</s><s>so you can't update a crm record that has no email address using the same username - trouble is if you provide a new username you actually create a new crm record and yu don't update the original record (which makes sense). 
</s><s>this is where the external / your id does come in handy - if you use this you can update the original record including changing the username - trouble now is - you have to know what the external / your id is and use this in any future updates which of course you can't find out unless yuo keep some external register. 
</s><s>so the learning here is - try and avid setting up crm contact redords for accessing secure zones where the contact has no email address. 
</s><s>if this has all confused yu - don't feel too bad... you could have shown yur ignorance of all this as i have publcily here... hope this helps others

<s>hi andrew, 
</s><s>if your site has multiple domains added and you choose hosting email with bc. the system will automatically create these secondary emails. 
</s><s>for example: 
domain1.com (primary) domain2.com (secondary) 
</s><s>you'll automatically will see the default mail account under mail.domain1.com.</s><s> so when create an email account you'll need to create under the primary account "andrew@domain1.com".</s><s> the system will see that you have a secondard domain with hosting with bc for email and will create "andrew@domain2.com" which will fall under the primary email account.

<s>hi sidney, 
</s><s>the screenshot you put here triggers an email to every subscriber in the secure zone, not an email to subscribers as they are added to the secure zone. 
</s><s>going into the back end of bc and sending password and login details to all subscribers is not the solution i am looking for.</s><s> also, interestingly enough, when i did this, the test subscriber who had no login name or password, got a login name, but no password was set.</s><s> so i hope this is acting as expected, and not another problem. 
</s><s>in the past, when someone was added to a secure zone from a form, a user name and password was generated automatically by bc and emailed to the subscriber.</s><s> later on it got modified to sending a user name and a link to set the password (recent development earlier this year). 
</s><s>now it looks like the email to a subscriber with their user name and password set link is no longer triggered automatically if they are added to a secure zone via a form. 
</s><s>so what i need to know is, do i have to add the email and password fields to the form to get the secure zone email triggered?</s><s> this is not a deal breaker, but my client doesn't want this, and acting on our knowledge of secure zones in bc for other websites, we told them it would not be needed.</s><s> looks like it is now, but it won't be a dealbreaker.</s><s> we'll just say the system has changed. 
</s><s>at the moment the form i have created just subscribes the applicant to a secure zone, but does not ask them to fill in a user name and password.</s><s> the form also adds them to a loyalty campaign as it is for a membership that expires after a certain time.</s><s> also the form is taking credit card payment for offline processing.

</s><s>did you test the form with a secure zone set up with a secure landing page?

i have put some a form on this web page, that subscribes the user to the secure zone, and adds expiry javascript, it has the unauthorized access message.</s><s> i have also tried a form with no expiry javascript, that subscribes the user to a secure zone and this also gets the unauthorized access message.

form with secure zone subscription and expiry javascript on this page http://www.warehousefitness.com.au/test form with secure zone subscription only on this page http://www.warehousefitness.com.au/test-two
