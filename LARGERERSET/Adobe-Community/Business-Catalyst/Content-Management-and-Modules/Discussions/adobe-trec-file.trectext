<s>hi there, editing the css to scale the large images is a real bad idea, especially huge ones as being indicated by you both.</s><s> these images are large and larger file size and will take a long time to download, especially on mobiles.</s><s> changing the css so they appear smaller does not change that at all. Ê you need upload images that are web optimised and scaled correctly first, this is really a good must for proper management.</s><s> in terms of the thumbnail images you need to just modify the module paramaters to get the size and scale you want so this is done server side and the images served already scaled.

<subject>muse menu editing & BC Blog - solution comments please</subject>
<post author="peterghill" timestamp="Mar 7, 2014 1:59 AM">
<s>new to muse & bc.</s><s> 
</s><s>created a site in muse, uploaded to mc no problem and added a news feed this shows on the site preview from bc but the news sub menu under in the know doesnt preview in muse. 
i followed in detail the muse and bc blog tutorial video, created bc main template, added {tag_pagecontent} but i now understand that i cannot re-edit the muse menu hyperlinks. 
blog name: mumsformums 
url: http://mumsformums2.businesscatalyst.com/blog 
so i have a site with top level nav: home in the know - news a new start lifestyle blog events contacts 
i have tried exporting blog page from muse and excluding it to no avail. 
</s><s>site structure is fairly simple but though i can preview the blog at: 
http://mumsformums2.businesscatalyst.com/blog?preview=true 
the blog doesnt show up @ http://mumsformums2.businesscatalyst.com/blog.html, i just get a page not found content holder text within {tag page element} 
as i have currently excluded uploading the blog page from muse, the blog page doesnt show up in my pages. 
i have tred creating a new page and asigning it the name blog but i get an error on publish that the page name is already being used by mums for mums blog. 
i am sure this is something on the blog side or within bc 
any help would be appreciated. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------- 
ok so i get to access the blog at: 
http://mumsformums2.businesscatalyst.com/blog and not 
http://mumsformums2.businesscatalyst.com/blog.html 
so how do i reedit the muse menu on the master and the bc main template to point to mumsformums/blog and not blog.html? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------- 
my solution so far: i have managed to get use a redirect to the http://mumsformums2.businesscatalyst.com/blog via url redirect. 
</s><s>as the page loads the main menu state was not correct (inactive as opposed to active).....so i then created an new muse master from scatch and applied the relevant styles to the bc menu master, i guess if i need another dynamic master within bc i will have to create another that is a child of the main master within muse. 
</s><s>comments would be great if this is not the correct approach.

<s>hi liam, 
</s><s>in the minds of my customers is it a bc problem or is a web problem?</s><s> it is a bc problem. 
</s><s>look at it this way; facebook, twitter and the many hundreds of websites that you can upload images to either disallow you from uploading images with spaces or loop through file names and convert the image filename to be web friendly. 
</s><s>we can't expect less tech-savvy clients to remove spaces from their images, especially if there is no clear warning on the website to remove them.</s><s> are you suggesting, that we train each and every user of each and every website that we have built to remove spaces from their filenames? 
</s><s>are you serious? 
</s><s>there is no debate here - bc should be doing something to fix this problem, whether it is to give adequate warning and advice during the file upload period, to rename images to be web friendly or to disallow spaces in images completely it has to be done.</s><s> to suggest that this is a 'web problem' is to make excuses for adobe.</s><s> we should not have to train our clients to remove spaces from images file names. 
</s><s>while i agree that with the tech-savvy it is simple to remove spaces from images it is not something we should expect users to do.</s><s> for an example, let's take a large scale ecommerce website.</s><s> there are multiple users of that website, some tech-savvy, others not-so.</s><s> this ecommerce website takes on a new user to help manage their products, who we will call john.</s><s> john isn't very tech savvy. 
</s><s>the business-owners take john through the basics of uploading a product, possibly even suggesting he removes spaces from image file names.</s><s> however, being the new guy, john doesn't remember that and fails to remove spaces from a couple of images.</s><s> nobody knows, because these images appear fine in the latest browsers.</s><s> three weeks later, this business decides to launch an email campaign, which looks great in tests to outlook!</s><s> as the business-owners are not tech-savvy, they very-happily launch the email campaign based on a template created by the original developers without testing.</s><s> the original developers cannot take into account spaces in images as html email cannot run javascript. 
</s><s>of course, just after the send date employee #5 notices that all of the product images are broken in gmail.</s><s> the business-owners then swiftly contact the web developers and all the blame comes to them, despite that fact they advised them on this originally. 
</s><s>so in conclusion here, the business-owners lose out on valuable profits and their reputation is damaged and the web-developers reputation is scarred indefinitely, with business catalyst's problems being blamed on them as the reseller.</s><s> everybody loses. 
</s><s>and all of this could of been avoided simply if adobe had put in adequate efforts (such as those previously described) to alleviate this problem. 
</s><s>to suggest that we should be training our clients and all of their new and changing users to do the following is to make excuses for adobe's failures.

<s>thats a long post andrew but you need to trial things before you say they do things and the rest - disagree. 
1.</s><s> twitter url shortens images into its system so no matter what the file its named into a computed series of numbers.</s><s> so this is not the same.</s><s> 2. facebook file uploads do not change the file name, images are treated in the same way as twitter. 
i and most people will never want to see the same treated to images on bc. seo is just one reason for that. 
</s><s>in terms of your thoughts - yes people do bad files and it causes problems in older browsers and javascript.</s><s> but those older browsers are getting older. 
</s><s>in terms of business owners etc; view the history of these forums and the previous 2 for bc. you will see no more then, as far as i can recall 5 people including yourself post about this issue over the course of 7+ years. 
</s><s>and as i have mentioned to you with lots of bc sites and clients under my belt - the 4 odd that have had issues with this soon sorted their issue, all but 1 before their site was live.</s><s> simple training, a simple guide to their site...</s><s> this is very easy to solve. 
i do not even batter an eye lid at this.</s><s> even naming conventions to get extra features bc normally can not do and having clients manage that is possible. 
</s><s>there are much more and much more important issues with bc and for client use, such as import and export management for example.</s><s> also you got bc and the infustrcture work this year and so smaller work will have attention on bc only this year.</s><s> so what is done needs to be important.</s><s> in terms of this, this is way way way down the list.</s><s> so even if it is something considered, like i said, do not expect this any time in the near future, this year, maybe not even next.

<s>problem is andrew you using something to justify what your saying that is totally unrelated. 
</s><s>why do they do this?</s><s> they dont care about being no spaces, or showing any relevence to what the original file name or anything is.</s><s> the reason they are uploaded and rendered in this way is for a number of reasons. 
- the images are converted into an optimised/compressed format of their prefered implementation. - in terms of facebook it does pre-scanning for facial information and so on and post processing. - the file names are ference data values for the system to understand and render and for the server system to process. 
</s><s>it has nothing to do with what your saying. 
</s><s>in terms of an actual website use this method is really very useless.</s><s> as mentioned your images would now have no seo or human reference use at all.</s><s> useability of images would now be harder for clients.</s><s> without viewing the image you linked for example - what is it?</s><s> you dont know. 
</s><s>and so on.</s><s> 
</s><s>your trying to find reasons to jusitfy what your saying which really do not marry up unfortunatly.</s><s> i get what your saying, converting images and files into lowercase and replacing %20 with - would be a nice to have.</s><s> point is, is it important in terms of bc right now?</s><s> no is it easily managed right now by everyone?</s><s> yes, with very simple and easy wording and information to clients when you train them to use their online business tool.</s><s> (bc) 
</s><s>so in the big scheme of things is it this big thing as you have outlined?</s><s> no.</s><s>

i am not suggesting the method for this should be the same as facebook or twitter, merely that the method is there.</s><s> it comes down purely to usability issue.</s><s> the expected result of an image upload of any web app, stemming from the behaviour demonstrated with large scale web applications such as facebook or twitter (the reason for my previous mentions), is that any image upload should work.</s><s> i guaruntee you, large scale application developers would see spaces in images as a problem. 
</s><s>it's not difficult to find a different method - you've already suggsted one yourself. 
</s><s>your points regarding human reference and seo is irrelevant because it is not about the method.</s><s> i have never suggested bc should clone facebook or twitter's url format. 
</s><s>additionally, if an image url is formatted as either 'product name 0132.jpg' or 'product_name_0132.jpg', they are both very much seo freindly and legible to a user.</s><s> so with that said, there is not a single reason this cannot be done. 
</s><s>as i said previously, this is a web problem, but it is a web problem that has been fixed for quite some time. 
</s><s>we should not have to train our clients on something they would expect to just work.

<s>i would like this feature too, specifically for usability purposes.

1.</s><s> default meta desc and meta keywords somewhere in site settings.</s><s> if a page does not override them the default values are inserted. 
2.</s><s> each page has a seo section with page title, page desc and page keywords.</s><s> they override step 1 if supplied. 
3.</s><s> same for categories, same for products.</s><s> 
</s><s>why is this such a hassle when every other product out there makes this so darn easy?</s><s> ugggggh.</s><s> 

</s><s>now with my rant over, here is my hack to address this for now. 
1.</s><s> make sure your page templates have no meta tags (unless you want the same thing for every page, or you want to make a page template for every page). 
2.</s><s> add <meta name="description" content="your desc here" /> and <meta name="keywords" content="your keywords,go here,separated by a comma,but not a space"> to the page content via the wysiwyg on each page, bc will insert this into the head section.

<s>i have used this tag often {tag_blogpostbodypreview, read more}, but in a recent update to an older site replacing {tag_blogpostbody} with {tag_blogpostbodypreview, read more} forces the "side-panel" div to slide under the post list and not to the right, as if that tag has a clear:both or block styling.

<s>blog preview always pulls the first paragraph so that will be in full.</s><s> if you at a point where firefox is finding to much wrong joel thats pretty bad to be honest.</s><s> you really need to address that.</s><s> i get annoyed when i have 4/5 errors on a page.</s><s> those will always be bc things i can not fix but if you do not have valid html, semantic html, css and javscript then fixing browser compatability issues and general bugs and issues like this become very hard.</s><s> changing those tags should not have any real effect on your layout for example but now your trying to track down the issue and fix it. 
</s><s>which firefox you using?</s><s> the latest is firefox 25 
a note on the concept if it works in firefox it works is not a good one firefox believe it or not is the number one browser in terms of reading something wrong and figuring out the best way to sort that out to make a website render.</s><s> so it can handle incorect enclosed lines in javascript or an extra comma where there should not be etc. for debugging thats why you browser test and check things like your console etc.</s><s> ie for example halts on a lot more errors in javascript and also of course is just bad at rendering html and css, even up to ie9 and in some css cases ie10 is bad too. 
</s><s>chrome and webkit browsers also are a bit more strict in the rendering etc. if you do a jquery click on a dropdown it will work on firefox but this is incorect though and in a webkit browser it wont work. it ahs to be onchange. 

</s><s>in terms of your error it pulls the html of first paragraph so it will be... 
<p>my stuff</p> 
</s><s>and the other tag you may have wrapped that in a p or a div or not so it just would have been... 
</s><s>this is my content..</s><s> <a href="">readmore</> 
</s><s>so if you not closed off a div etc or have double of of a pargraph you will encounter a html issue.</s><s> i not checked out your site so i cant say which.</s><s> but it will be a html validation.</s><s> run your page through validation and find your errors.

<s>i sent the information to marius but i found the issue likely having people get their staging url indexed by google and it is because of the sitemap.xml 
1. if you duplicate an existing site the sitemap.xml that now shows in ftp comes over.</s><s> even if you take the new site live, make changes during its development the system thinks that the sitemap.xml it sees is one you have manually added so does not trigger the sitemap.xml updates with new url's etc. if you had not figured this out you do not know about it and you get things indexed and then have to work to get the removed. 
2.</s><s> in the other issue case if you have a website which you activate (pay) for the cms to do development and testing on things like payment forms, ecommerce etc the system now turns on the sitemap.xml (as its not manual under the new ui).</s><s> but it wil generate the development url.</s><s> this is ok as you should not have linked the site openly and google should not see it.</s><s> but if you take the site live, change to the new domain url the sitemap will keep rendering in the old development url. 
</s><s>if you delete the sitemap.xml in the hope it will generate a new one, this also then does not work (did this to two sites) and checked the next day and no sitemap.xml was generated.</s><s> i knew i could go to the old ui or use the url in the admin to access the old seo page and i saw that the sitemap.xml was off.</s><s> it was not till i turned that back on and then waited for the next day i saw the sitemap.xml created and also with the correct links. 
</s><s>if you are not aware of these (which most wont, you do not expect this) and you do things like register your sitemap.xml with google webmaster tools etc or it finds it naturually you are going to run into a variety of issues from it thinkin you have duplicant content to registering those url's you do not want it to. 
</s><s>so with this in mind there needs to be some improvements to avoid and address these issues, the changes you guys made are not 100% just yet. 
@jsjs2012 if you have had this you need to make sure things like the above has not occured and then do things like tell google webmaster tools about the development urls and how you not want them to show etc. that and ensuring your not linking to those urls any where on the site (happens more then you think, people think they have not but they have) etc and if you just give it a few weeks google gets the idea and they first drop in ranking over your actual content and then do not show up at all.

<s>i used the jquery bassistance validation plugin in the checkout form, it works like a charm, however, i run into a little issue with dropdowns (select). 
</s><s>to validate a select dropdown, the unvalid option needs to have an empty value - example: 
<select name="shippingstate" id="shippingstate" class="required"> <option selected="selected" value="">-- state --</option> <option value="act">act</option> <option value="nsw">nsw</option> <option value="nt">nt</option> <option value="qld">qld</option> <option value="sa">sa</option> <option value="tas">tas</option> <option value="vic">vic</option> <option value="wa">wa</option> </select> 
</s><s>now once the page is saved, bc scraps the empty value and i end up with: 
<option selected="selected">-- state --</option> 
i was trying to work around it somehow, but with no luck so far.

<s>hey creativeaholic, 
</s><s>in the old version of the forums i helped someone combine dreamweaver spry integration into a bc form.</s><s> basically, the spry javascript validation sits on top of the site as the first layer of validation and if that fails or there's no javascript, bc's required/non-required basic form validation takes hold and works it from there. 
</s><s>you can see a demo of what i've got working at http://ignitemybusiness.com/demos/dreamweaver-spry-validation 
the person i was assisting was trying to validate a social security number so don't put a real one in there for testing since the form does end up submitting a case to my site which i'll ignore and i don't want your danged ssn~! 
</s><s>the key to using dw spry on top of the bc validation is that they both use the form element's onsubmit attribute so essentially, you need to build your form in bc and add it to a page, then you need to setup dw spry validation in dw as you normally would but you'll overwrite the onsubmit attribute for the form when you do that so when you're done you need to update the onsumbit javascript to essentially say, "if this form validates for spry, continue validating using bc's javscript next" and of course, if that validates for bc's javascript, the form will send. 
</s><s>here's the code for the onsubmit attribute you need to add to the form: <form onsubmit="if (spry.widget.form.validate(this)) {checkwholeform37632(this); return false;} else {return false;}"> 
</s><s>of course, you'll need to change the function name from "checkwholeform57632" to whatever your unique function is that was created on the fly for bc for your form.</s><s> the key to integrating spry and bc is updating the onsubmit like above and you'll be all set.</s><s> feel free to play with and dissect my demo above.

<a id="catshopbuy" onclick="if (spry.widget.form.validate(this)) {return validatecart(2199736);} else {return false;}"><img alt="" src="/catalystimages/shop_checkout.png"></a>

<s>yes true, and it will all work fine, but the limitations i found are in terms of some validations. 
</s><s>for example: validating the type of credit card "visa, mastercard" etc. 
i couldn't find how to select different types of cards, you either choose 1 single type of card, or all of them, where in australia, we rarely have dinner club, and some people don't like to allow amex because there are many fees behind it, so they like to stick to just visa and mastercard. 
so the validation trigger would be: var textfieldwidget1 = new spry.widget.validationtextfield("textfieldwidget1", "credit_card"); 
and you can specify the type of card by modifying it to: var textfieldwidget1 = new spry.widget.validationtextfield("textfieldwidget1", "credit_card", {format:"visa"}); 
but then if you want to add mastercard, usually you'll do: var textfieldwidget1 = new spry.widget.validationtextfield("textfieldwidget1", "credit_card", {format:"visa, mastercard"}); 
the problem with that, you get a javascript markup error. 
there sould be a workaround, i just didn't have time to think properly, unless if you have already found the answer, that will be great.

<s>actually, i was mistaken.Ê adding spry validation in dreamweaver to a form that was built in bc does not override the onsubmit element on the form.Ê my apologies.</s><s> but if we want to add the spry validation on top of bc's javascript validation we will need to adjust the onsubmit function to test to see if the form validates via spry first, and if it does pass spry validation, then send it over to the bc validation. Ê the steps go like this: Ê create a form in bc and include your required fields as necessary.Ê create a field for "social security number" or anything else you want to validate with spry.</s><s> be sure to include this field in the bc form.</s><s> don't create the input in dreamweaver that needs spry validation.</s><s> do it on bc. insert your new bc web form on a web page via the admin panel's module manager or via the dreamweaver bc extension.</s><s> open up dreamweaver and download the page you just created from your bc site.</s><s> open the page that has your bc form in dreamweaver.</s><s> click the code view so that we can see the document source and take note of the form element's onsubmit attribute.</s><s> it should be something similar to: onsubmit="return checkwholeform77506(this)" except that your form will have it's own unique name for the checkwholeform function.Ê copy the function and save it on your page.</s><s> i usually add html comments just above the form element to save it.</s><s> such as: <!-- checkwholeform77506(this) --> you can leave the onsubmit function as it is for now, just copy it for reference.</s><s> we'll use it later.</s><s> now you can select an input element in your form and add spry validation widgets as you need them.Ê there will be a dialog to warn you that there's already an onsubmit function for the form.</s><s> just click ok.</s><s> when you insert your spry validations, dreamweaver will add script and css links to your document.Ê if you want to move those assets to a more permanent place, just copy those files to the folder you want and update their locations in dreamweaver so that they are pointing to the right javascripts and css files.</s><s> once your validations are setup, the last step is to edit the onsubmit attribute on the form element.Ê switch to code view again and we'll want to update that attribute with this: onsubmit="if (spry.widget.form.validate(this)) {checkwholeform77506(this); return false;} else {return false;}" important: each form's onsubmit function will vary slightly.Ê since each form has a unique "checkwholeform" function built by bc (my example is "checkwholeform77506(this)") you'll need to copy your unique function that we copied and hid before and replace my example.</s><s> check to make sure your onsubmit attribute on the form element looks like my example above but with your unique function in the place of mine.</s><s> save your web page in dreamweaver and press ctrl-u to upload.</s><s> select yes to upload the dependant files like the spry javascript and css that dreamweaver added for us. open your website and surf to the page with the form on it and test it out.

<s>for the captcha, yes.</s><s> i just used the default one and i've had no issues tying in spry for other fields and using captcha at the same time. 
</s><s>for a date picker you should be just fine too, just use a javascript datepicker.</s><s> i prefer one that was made for twitter bootstrap at http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker/ 
if you use a datepicker javascript widget like above you don't really need to use spry validation to validate that date since they'll be choosing the date from the widget and the script formats the date correctly for the user.

<s>frank, 
</s><s>it looks like your form element's onsubmit is fine.</s><s> no problem there.</s><s> it matches the checkwholeform function below.</s><s> i think you might be missing the links to the js and css for the dreamweaver spry validation.</s><s> when you are working on the form in dreamweaver, it should insert the required js and css and then you need to either copy that js or css to a specific location that you prefer or just upload those files to the site wherever dreamweaver places them in your site structure.</s><s> i prefer the former. 
</s><s>also, it doesn't look like the actual spry validation javascript code is on the page so maybe you need to add the spry validation to the form fields in dreamweaver first.</s><s> all it looks like you've done is implemented the form's onsubmit code properly but haven't actually inserted the spry validations in dreamweaver yet.
