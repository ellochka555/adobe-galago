<s>the workflow uses the invoice layout, the same as the email invoice.</s><s> so under system emails - invoice.</s><s> you can work on the structure and style in there.</s><s> you can of course access it via ftp too.   as you probably know you do inline styles for emails, no javascript of course   you can adjust the quanitity td's to have less width, maybe drop the font in a few places too.   another option is to re-do the whole workflow notification layout, it has a restricted width so if it is an issue for you when getting orders, you can redo the whole thing to have a more fluid with or horizontal paper print format if you like.</s><s> you need to do it in a way that for other forms it looks fine still as well.</s><s> it is up to you really, depends on what your after exactly and have a play with the code to get it how you need.

<s>thanks for the response, liam.</s><s> adobe support basically dismissed my problem as a css/html issue outside their purview and suggested that i take a look at this thread.</s><s> funny.</s><s> but i don't know if it is essentially a css/html issue.</s><s> if it is, i can't figure a way around it.</s><s> it has more to do with the way bc tags are parsed into html.</s><s> here is my response to support's reply.</s><s> if i am missing something obvious, maybe someone can point it out: 
i would say this isn't so much about html/css as it is about the way that bc parses the tags on the invoice template.</s><s> the invoice places each of the tags in a single table td, but when it parses those tags for several items, it appears to spit out lists into each single td rather than keeping each list item as a separate td in a single table row.</s><s> so the detail columns and rows of the purchased items don't match up. 
</s><s>i've tried every way that i can think of to work around this using html and css, but nothing seems to work.</s><s> furthermore the process is frustrating as i can't even view how bc actually parses the code.</s><s> when i look at the source of the invoice and workflow emails generated, it appears encrypted, so i can't actually see how it is behaving. 
</s><s>in addition, there does not seem to be a way to preview the template changes without generating an actual sale.</s><s> this is less than ideal, as i have to keep making purchases on my own credit card to test the changes, and then go through the process of refunding all those sales. 
</s><s>as i can neither see the code generated by the invoice template when parsing actual lists of sale items, nor test the process without making actual purchases, even if it were an html/css issue and not a function of the bc tags, it would still be cumbersome to say the least. 
</s><s>if you look at my invoice template, and the list that results (the example in my first post above) you will see the problem.</s><s> i need to have the results of the {tag_productname}, {tag_custom1}, {tag_productextaxamount}, {tag_productquantity}, and {tag_producttotalextax} tags line up in coherent rows in a list of purchased items. 
</s><s>surely i can't be the only one with this problem.</s><s> if so, i must be missing something obvious.

<s>thanks, liam.</s><s> your tip about going to the order section of admin and choosing print was very helpful.</s><s> that allows me to see both the layout of the invoice as it will be rendered by bc and the source html.</s><s> great!</s><s> 
</s><s>however, the basic problem still remains.</s><s> i can't style the output for the purchased item list details of the invoice because the html i need to style is not generated by the invoice template but by the bc tags inserted into the template (such as {tag_productname}, {tag_custom1}, {tag_productextaxamount}, {tag_productquantity}, and {tag_producttotalextax}). 
</s><s>each of these tags generates a series of divs like <div class="productitemcell">item detail</div> that are placed vertically into a single td in my table.</s><s> but many of our inventory items have text strings (title, author) that are long and will flow over onto a second line within the div.</s><s> so when the content of the table is generated, i end up with a single row of several tds, one for each bc tag, each of which contains the series of divs generated by the given tag, some of which flow over onto second lines.</s><s> so the item details in the table do not line up horizontally for any given item.</s><s> as in the original picture above. 
</s><s>here is the relevant code from the invoice template: 
<table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" class="border"> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top" style="width: 45%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">title</span></td> <td valign="top" style="width: 20%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">author</span></td> <td valign="top" style="width: 5%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">price</span></td> <td valign="top" style="width: 5%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">quantity</span></td> <td valign="top" style="width: 5%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">total</span></td> </tr> <tr class="text"> <td valign="top" style="width: 45%;">{tag_productname}</td> <td valign="top" style="width: 20%;">{tag_custom1}</td> <td valign="top" style="width: 5%;">{tag_productextaxamount}</td> <td valign="top" style="width: 5%; text-align: center;"> {tag_productquantity}</td> <td valign="top" style="width: 5%;"> {tag_producttotalextax}</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
</s><s>and here is what gets generated when there are several items in the invoice: 
<table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" class="border"> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top" style="width: 45%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">title</span></td> <td valign="top" style="width: 20%;"><span style= "text-decoration: underline;">author</span></td> <td valign="top" style="width: 5%;"><span style= "text-decoration: underline;">price</span></td> <td valign="top" style="width: 5%;"><span style= "text-decoration: underline;">quantity</span></td> <td valign="top" style="width: 5%;"><span style= "text-decoration: underline;">total</span></td> </tr> <tr class="text"> <td valign="top" style="width: 45%;"> <div class="productitemcell">american indians and the law</div> <div class="productitemcell">a song for the horse nation - horses in native american cultures</div> <div class="productitemcell">the porcupine year</div> <div class="productitemcell">a nation within a nation - voices of the oneidas in wisconsin</div> <div class="productitemcell">art in our lives - native women artists in dialogue</div> <div class="productitemcell">native american clothing : an illustrated history</div> <div class="productitemcell">greet the dawn: the lakota way</div> </td> <td valign="top" style="width: 20%;"> <div class="productitemcell">n.</s><s> bruce duthu</div> <div class="productitemcell">national museum of the american indian</div> <div class="productitemcell">louise erdrich</div> <div class="productitemcell">l.</s><s> gordon mclester iii and laurence m.hauptman</div> <div class="productitemcell">cynthia chavez lamar and sherry farrell racette (eds)</div> <div class="productitemcell">theodore brasser</div> <div class="productitemcell">s.</s><s> d. nelson</div> </td> <td valign="top" style="width: 5%;"> <div class="productitemcell">$21.95</div> <div class="productitemcell">$14.95</div> <div class="productitemcell">$5.99</div> <div class="productitemcell">$34.95</div> <div class="productitemcell">$30.00</div> <div class="productitemcell">$65.00</div> <div class="productitemcell">$18.95</div> </td> <td valign="top" style="width: 5%; text-align: center;"> <div class="productitemcell">1</div> <div class="productitemcell">1</div> <div class="productitemcell">1</div> <div class="productitemcell">1</div> <div class="productitemcell">1</div> <div class="productitemcell">1</div> <div class="productitemcell">1</div> </td> <td valign="top" style="width: 5%;"> <div class="productitemcell">$21.95</div> <div class="productitemcell">$14.95</div> <div class="productitemcell">$5.99</div> <div class="productitemcell">$34.95</div> <div class="productitemcell">$30.00</div> <div class="productitemcell">$65.00</div> <div class="productitemcell">$18.95</div> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
</s><s>as both {tag_productname} and {tag_custom1} can generate longer strings of text, i need a way either to line up the lists of divs created by the tags in the td columns so that the name, author, price, quantity and total of each purchased item align horizontally across the page or i need a way to limit the height of <div class="productitemcell"> cutting off any text that would flow to the next line. 
</s><s>gmail accepts only inline styles.</s><s> any css placed in the head of the email will be ignored.</s><s> but i can't style <div class="productitemcell"> because those divs don't even exist until they are generated by the bc tags when the invoice is created.</s><s> and as these invoices are sent as emails, i need to limit the width of the item table to about 600px. 
</s><s>do you see the problem? 
</s><s>so it is a css/html problem, but it is a problem generated by the bc tags.</s><s> reverting to the invoice template default doesn't change the basic issue.</s><s> and i am not seeing a workable solution. 
</s><s>adobe ticket support is no use.</s><s> they suggest using js and css, which are "outside the scope of support", and then offer links to css basics tutorials.</s><s> as you mentioned, javascript is irrelevant for emails, and i am not seeing a way to apply an inline style to a div that doesn't exist in the invoice template.</s><s> maybe there is another way to do this that i am overlooking. 
</s><s>any further suggestions are greatly appreciated!

</s><s>the only way i can see to do this is to have two forms on checkout and show one based on logged in/logged out criteria, and this is no problem to implement.</s><s> what is a problem is that the amount field on one of the forms just won't populate - it's completely blank.</s><s> if i delete one of the forms from the page, it begins to work again without a hitch.

<s>thanks, liam.</s><s> 
</s><s>the second part of your answer doesn't really hold true though.</s><s> if you have a password field and have the form set to subscribe people to a secure zone on log out, it will always send users an email giving them their username and password, and telling them what zone they're subscribed to.</s><s> i understand it doesn't resubscribe them...but i want to supress this behaviour - it is undesirable.</s><s> in a nutshell: 
i have two secure zones - one members (paid subscription), one general (bought something online). 
</s><s>if they are a member of neither, i want them to get a general subscription on checkout. 
</s><s>if they are a member, i don't want to subscribe them to anything. 
</s><s>even if i have to subscribe them to the general secure zone, i'd love it if they wouldn't get notification of this.

<s>hi,

<s>i've done as much digging as i can do and am still a little confused about the ability to control the formatting and options for product search and search results.   after a couple of hours digging, i've successfully rerouted the main template search to search products instead of the whole site using the product search modules.</s><s> page edit mode -> right sidebar -> toolbox -> e-commerce -> products   i used both the product search form and product search results shortcodes with some tweaking to make it work with a simplified template search field,  which reroutes to a results page that also includes the more advanced product search form in a sidebar.   however, i could not find a way to customize the catalog drop down menu options.   <select name="cat_productcatalogue" id="cat_productcatalogue" class="cat_dropdown_small">{module_catalogueselect}</select>   my client has over 6500 products so far.</s><s> his customers really don't need to see every sub catalog on a search drop down.</s><s> is there a way to specify upper catalog level view only in the search drop down menu?   such options appear readily available for some modules but not others.</s><s> for example, the product search results module seems fairly straight forward - items per row, target window, total results per page, and sorting...</s><s> {module_productresults,3,_self,20,alphabetical,,,,,,true}   then again, within the productresults module, i can't figure out how to control results pagination at the bottom.</s><s> i've tried css tweaking, as well as attempted to insert the pagination tags to no success.</s><s> ideally, i could move the pagination further down on the page so that it doesn't hug the bottom of the product results, perhaps change the link color, padding of the cell, or include the arrow images.</s><s> no such luck.</s><s> anyone have any tips on customizing product search results pagination?</s><s> also, why is the pagination stuck in a table row and cell?

<s>hey man-- 
</s><s>you can do this with a simple regular expression and some jquery that looks for all text within your site or a certain element and replaces it with your own text. 
</s><s>here's the javascript you can add to the end of your page near the closing </body> tag or in another javascript file you're already referencing.</s><s> it must be included after jquery is loaded on the page.</s><s> you can include it in the head of your page template if you wish but it must follow the jquery library reference. 
</s><s>i'm using a site that has us (english) as the culture/language so my "catalogue" is spelled "catalog"..</s><s> just update the code below to match your version of catalogue.</s><s> also, i'm searcing the whole "body" element but you can be more specific if you wish.</s><s> you can change the references to "body" to something else like "#content" or ".shop-layout" or whatever container has your text somewhere as child text node. 
(function($){
    $(document).ready(function() {
        var noproductsmessage = "your no products message";
        // you can use html markup if you escape quotes with a backslash 
        // or if you use single quotes in html markup
        var nosubcatalogmessage = "your no subcatalogs message";
        
       // update "this catalog has no products." message
       $("body").html(
           $("body").html()
           // update "this catalog has no products." message
           .replace(/this catalog has no products\./gi, noproductsmessage)

           // update "this catalog has no sub-catalogs." message
           .replace(/this catalog has no sub-catalogs\./gi, nosubcatalogmessage)
       ); 
    });
})(jquery); 
you'll notice the .replace() function uses the regular expression.. you can update what's in between the / and \./gi to match the text you want to replace.</s><s> it doesn't matter about capital letters since this regex works with all cases.</s><s> you'll also notice i'm escaping the period: \. 
</s><s>periods are special characters in regex that means "any character" so if you just use /this catalog has no products./gi it will still match the period but i'm telling this regex to specifically match a period not any character. 
</s><s>you can replace the variables with your messages and i added one for the "no sub-catalogs" message too since you'll likely want that as well.</s><s> if you don't want to use it-- comment out that line by throwing a // in front of that line of js. 
</s><s>best of luck.</s><s> here's the fiddle of it in action so you can play around with it and update catalog to catalogue if you need to: http://jsfiddle.net/thetrickster/k35qv/

<s>not everyone knows the bc system inside and out like you, liam.</s><s> it's hard to remember all the nooks and crannies since the system isn't really predictable and organized.

class="enquiry, t-shirt, clothing" 
</s><s>and that's not valid css and then you'll need to use javascript to clean it up at runtime.

</s><s>i'd rather error on the side of making it easier for the client to remember how to trigger products for quoting even if that means we need to use javascript for the workaround. 
</s><s>also, i just tested the {tag_tags} and it just outputs the value of that field so if you enter keywords as "clothing men upscale" it will output that but i know i would definitely enter "clothing, men, upscale" since that's usually the way you enter keywords in most use cases for the web.

<s>has anyone had success in people paying paypal after an order? 

</s><s>we have paypal set up perfectly for checkout.</s><s> customer pay then they come back to our website and see they have paid. 
</s><s>but if the customer gets an order and then logs in online to pay it (e.g http://bit.ly/uc85r5), paypal will take them to their payment page, take the payment but when it takes them back to our site an error message comes up: error: an unknown error occurred.</s><s> this is most likely due to the merchant profile not being set up correctly.</s><s> please contact your system administrator for help.

all paypal settings are fine and as per business catalyst knowledge base.

<s>back to initial enquiry, it would be great for us if bc development team give us just rough information on new features being implemented. 
</s><s>say "paypal standard on standalone webform" is at considered as "to be implemeneted" then you can at least let us know it's "being considered" because at this stage we don't know whether each request is being considered or disregarded. 
</s><s>in addition to simon's word, small business or individuals like us try to stick to one platform (bc here) and some time it's hard to manage jobs.</s><s> we dropped quite few bc websites and chose other ecommerce platform for because of bc's lack of basic function (i still think bc is a great platform and that's why we stick to it but some time it still doesn't make sense to be honest) 
</s><s>for instance, a customer wanted forum functionality on bc for their staff communication & project sharing.</s><s> it's there but it's not usable.</s><s> it's too out dated, reply function doesn't make sense and forum editor is hopeless.</s><s> i've contacted bc support over few months and every time i get told that "it's been added to feature request." now i have no word to tell my client other than "impossible" so we planning to move the entire bc website to some other.</s><s> it's quite big loss for us, the client and bc as well.</s><s> i hope the "wishlist" comes back (not as anybody can add them but somehow as a "feature request" status board ?</s><s>) 
</s><s>anyway, these days a lot of people come to us requesting modern & simple purchasing style but it cannot be done via the shop layout so i guess this might need to be answered soon.</s><s> otherwise we need to move (in australia) to payflow.</s><s> set up fee is $300 and there's $45 monthly fee as well, why so different from us free payflow account?</s><s> this is australia then we will need to cancel current payment gateway plan and maybe existing merchant account as well, what a pain it could be !
