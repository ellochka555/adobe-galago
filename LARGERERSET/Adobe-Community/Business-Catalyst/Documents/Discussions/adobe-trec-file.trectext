<s>i've successfully added ecommerce tracking for google analytics to my business catalyst sites.</s><s> i haven't found any [free] definitive guides out there, so i thought i'd share.</s><s> business catalyst files for the tracking script, the business catalyst file you need to have opened is /layouts/onlineshop/order_receipt-us.html.</s><s> however, you also need to add the google analytics script - with out the ecommerce modification - to all the pages on your site.</s><s> i recommend putting in the <head> of your page templates.   google analytics ecommerce tracking to start tracking business catalyst ecommerce transactions with google analytics, here are the steps you need to take.</s><s> log into google analytics and navigate to the profile settings page for the business catalyst site.</s><s> under "ecommerce settings" select "yes, this is an e-commerce site".</s><s> while still in analytics, go to the "tracking code" tab under your profile.</s><s> don't grab the code from the standard tab.</s><s> instead, select "advanced".  when someone goes through the cart on a business catalyst site, the domain switches to *.worldsecuresystems.com.</s><s> so you need to select "multiple top-level domains".</s><s> i would also select the check boxes for adwords campaigns, doubleclick data and track online ad campaigns from other providers the script google shows you on this page is what you should put on all your page templates.</s><s> now you're ready to grab that code and modify it for ecommerce tracking.</s><s> the code given in google analytics should go on all the pages of your website.</s><s> the easiest way to accomplish that is to put it on all your templates.</s><s> however, there's one more step.</s><s> you then need to modify the code for your receipt page as shown below.</s><s> finally, place that modified code on the /layouts/onlineshop/order_receipt-us.html page.</s><s> here's what it should look like modified.</s><s> [you'll need to close the script tags, of course.</s><s>]     
            
        script type="text/javascript"
        var _gaq = _gaq || [];
        _gaq.push(['_setaccount', 'ua-*******-*']);  // your google analytics profile id
        _gaq.push(['_setdomainname', 'example.com']); // your domain name - not *.worldsecuresystems.com, but the domain you've chosen for your site
        _gaq.push(['_setallowlinker', true]);
        _gaq.push(['_trackpageview']);
        _gaq.push(['_addtrans', "{tag_orderid}", // order id
                   "", // affiliation
                   "{tag_amount}", // total
                   "", // tax
                   "", // shipping

            var s = document.getelementsbytagname('script')[0];
            s.parentnode.insertbefore(ga, s);
        })();
    /script result you won't see all the details about the purchase in google analytics.</s><s> that's because business catalyst does not pass all the needed variables to the order receipt page.</s><s> [perhaps that's a feature request.</s><s>]   however, it's still valuable to know the order id and revenue in google analytics - knowing which sources drive your revenue is critical.</s><s> it's also pretty easy to grab the order id [under ecommerce > transactions in google analytics] and look in your business catalyst site for the order.</s><s> here's a screenshot of the results i saw on the first day.

<subject>Any methods for developing more complex sites with BC, like server-side functionality?</subject>
<post author="patrickstinson" timestamp="Aug 29, 2013 3:35 PM">
<s>i am trying to assess bc's potential from a developer's perspective and am having a lot of trouble finding my way through the available documentation and forums since the resources are relatively fragmented.   for example, what do you do when a client comes to us wanting a more dynamic web app that requires a more involved database than the web app features can provide, or dynamically interacts with the db on the server, or needs to interface with external systems in a secure way without putting auth info right in the javascript when bc doesn't provide access to the server outside of the limited soap api.</s><s> i'm seeing only contacts, orders, and cases in the soap api?</s><s> it looks like a "web app" is the only way to store data in a database on the website, but there is no api for accessing that data, even from the javascript on the same origin domain.</s><s> we are already invested in bc enough to want to stick with it, but is there anyone out there that is finding creative ways to fill bc's feature gap?</s><s> maybe some hybrid between bc and a more conventional server-side setup hosted elsewhere?</s><s> thanks!</s><s>

<s>agreed on alot of your points above, the documentation is extremely fragmented imo, to answer your question, it depends on what your customer is asking regarding server side stuff, there is quite alot of things ajax, css and javascript can do with bc, rewriting pages, redisplaying pages, moving things around etc. 
</s><s>with regards to the api, yes nothing we can do about webapps data currently, i have stored data before as part of cases (database) api and used the api to pull that data down.</s><s> you can also store all your data in json (text) into large text fields as part of cases, but it starts to get a little messy in the admin tool.

<post author="thetrickster888" timestamp="Jun 25, 2013 2:56 PM">
<s>hey steve, 
</s><s>it really depends on your clientele.</s><s> bc is great for building a business' first website and to incorporate things like email campaigns, in-context site editing, secure zones and ecommerce. 
</s><s>if your client has a very specific ecommerce setup that isn't covered in the bc ecommerce suite then since bc is a proprietary system and you cannot code server-side processes to customize a lot of it, you might need to use another solution for ecommerce. 
</s><s>if i were you i would try to adapt most of your clients to bc since using bc will cut your development and design time over a traditional php development setup.</s><s> but in order to do some advanced things on bc sometimes we need to have a subdomain off the main domain for a client that is a standard php setup. 
</s><s>i've been using heroku's free php hosting for some of my client sites for those cases so i'm not paying for it but if it's a highly frequented site you might have to pay heroku so that your php hosting doesn't crash (the free account has limited resources). 
</s><s>you could also do a reseller account too and have a bc account and reseller account but i don't recommend godaddy for hosting.</s><s> their domain name services are great but i would use a reseller account elsewhere.</s><s> i used a place called http://railsplayground.net before and i can say they have great support and uptime.</s><s> for $20 - $25 a month you can have a very substantial reseller setup using the standard cpanel/whm to manage your account. 
</s><s>if you do plan to use bc for clients you need to be a paid partner.</s><s> paid partners get to have a partner portal where they can setup their own billing prices, create new customer sites and rebrand the whole bc solution for their customer's admin areas.
