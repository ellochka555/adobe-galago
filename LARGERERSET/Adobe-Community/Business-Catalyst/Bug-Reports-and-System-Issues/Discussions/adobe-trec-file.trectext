<subject>BC/Muse syncing issue with third-party code</subject>
<post author="navigatorjim" timestamp="Feb 6, 2014 9:06 AM">
<s>hi there, i was hoping someone had a solution to this issue - which is this:   i have used some third party code for a hotel's 'quickbook' function on every page.</s><s> periodically, this code stops working on some pages, and works on others - mainly when i republish the site via muse.   i asked the code's developer to look at it and they found this problem:   <form method="post" action="http://fe.avvio.com/convert/site/clandeboye%20lodge/index.php" id="c5quickbook3fields"></form>   the form effectively begins and ends on the same line.   however, the </form> appears on a completely different line in the code - rather than the wrong place (as indicated above) it appears in excatly the correct place.</s><s> does bc 'render' this either in the wrong place, or doesn't recognise it being there at all?   as a temporary fix: when i log into bc and edit the website from the back end, all i have to do is navigate to the offending page where the quickbook rests, click 'update' without making any changes at all and it begins working again.   as a workaround this is obvioulsy a bit of a chore, but more importantly it's impossible to tell when, or on what page, this third party code decides not to work!   it's worth pointing out that the third party code seems to be fine - i've had it looked over and it does in fact work continuously on competitor websites i've been checking.   apologies if it doesn't make sense... honestly, it has me baffled.</s><s> i might even have to re-word this at a later stage!   thanks for any help though.

<s>hi, 
</s><s>i'm noticing a trend of increased spam web form submissions across most of our bc sites.</s><s> this has got particularly bad in the past week or so.</s><s> all spam submissions follow a very similar theme.</s><s> the text is complete 'gobbledygook' basically!</s><s> the forms being used don't have any description fields where long descriptions or links can be entered so i struggle to see why this is happening. 
</s><s>what i want to know is: 
- is this something other bc partners are noticing, particularly recently - are your spam submissions similar to what i have shown below - what can we do to reduce these other than using captcha on all forms? - we exclusively use bc but i would be interested to know if the bc platform is particularly bad for spam submissions or is this something all sites are suffering from nowadays? - any other light you could shed on this issue or advice you could impart would be much appreciated 
real submission example: 
first name: tjlavseb surname: tjlavseb email: zosdcu@dnhstb.com date: hgnhqmmssgynjlb time: 11am house name: lhkjxazhguyclezjqd street address: nvoaqumesbbgsa postcode: ljeodtxlxj

<s>hey there, since you mentioned other then captcha i take it you have not put these on the forms? - if you create any new form you will see a new module in there.</s><s> you can copy that into any of your old forms which will help with spam a bit more. - you need to input a captcha on forms if you want to avoid spam - it is not the platform that is being hit with spam, it is your site.</s><s> a site as it gets more web traffic gets targeted more with spam, that is the nature of gaining more web traffic on a site.

<s>doing a little bit of looking into alternatives to captcha:

</s><s>this would meain spambots trawling a website looking for form's and their inputs, won't see the field setup in the javascript.

</s><s>delibrately add a random field to a form that is hidden using css, but will be submitted by spambots which don't realise that the field is actually redundant. 
</s><s>this would mean the form handler rejecting any form submission made with the hidden field completed.

<s>brilliant! 
what is the usual timeline for a sprint mario lol? 
</s><s>defintely agree with liam in that most of the tags/module tags for both the list and detail layouts should be universal as there are some situations where you need to use the tags dynamically to create outputs that need to be shown in both... 
for example i'm using a polldaddy rating system for a webapp currently and to get it to show up on each listing item separately requires a unique id so using {tag_itemid} made perfect sense as it wouldnt break any polldaddy coding... however i cannot call the same rating system into the detail page (where it would logically be repeated) because i cannot replicate the same id with no {tag_itemid} availble. 
</s><s>asecond example is: since we had managed to put a readers upload gallery into a nice compact layout in the list layout using litebox and the ?</s><s>action=thumbnail feature the client really wanted to keep the photo gallery commenting system simple aslo (not to many steps) so ideally we would have liked to only ustilise the list-template and put the comment feedback tag in a sliding div (to show & hide it) so that readers could stay on one list page... but once again this wasnt possible becuase the {module_ratingfeedback} was not available in the list view (forcing us to make them click through to the detail page). 
fyi: heres a sample link to what we had to put together in the end for the above - still slightly in development http://www.nzhunter.co.nz/test-gallery 

</s><s>anyway i think you get the idea - more flexibility and universal usage options for tags/module calls would be great.

<s>your not really listening as i keep saying that is only one part of the puzzle but something you should do as standard to avoid the problem and as part of the sollution or you will continue to have issues.</s><s> like i keep saying also conical is a suggestive element and not a directive like the 301 for example.</s><s> if google thinks a worldsecuresystems link is stronger it can still choose to use that one over what you ask it to with the cononical.</s><s> do you want google to stop indexing or looking at the urls?</s><s> yes, then that is one step.</s><s> as i said the other thing is to go through your webmaster tools and address the links with disavow and other internal link block features.

a chat with live support concludes bc aren't offering any kind of solution which puts business calatyst site owners in a tricky legal position.

</s><s>the bbc have updated their privacy policy quite extensively and i hope to god this approach becomes an acceptable measure. http://www.bbc.co.uk/privacy/bbc-cookies-policy.shtml 
bt have gone a step further and implemented a rather impressive solution where you get a modal pop-up regards cookie consent and a rather cool slider to indicate the type of cookies you are happy to receive.</s><s> strictly speaking though it is still not fully compliant as they create cookies first and then ask you after the event if you are ok with it.

<s>hi liam,

</s><s>it's still very much up in the air, and there are plenty of people lobbying against this, so it's likely to change considerably.</s><s> however, at the moment, it seems that it is the intended audience of the website that determines the need for compliance. 
</s><s>this is an extract from guidance provided by the 'information commissioner's office' (ico), a government organisation here in the uk: "an organisation based in the uk is likely to be subject to the requirements of the regulations even if their website is technically hosted overseas.</s><s> organisations based outside of europe with websites designed for the european market, or providing products or services to customers in europe, should consider that their users in the uk and europe will clearly expect information and choices about cookies to be provided." - suggesting that we all have to be mindful of these regulations.

<s>ricky is right, it is not where the server is located but where the website visitor is located. 
</s><s>not sure where the ambiguity comes from though, the law has been well covered since it came about 12 months ago and it's pretty clear what is required - before creating a cookie you must first gain consent. 
</s><s>despite it being lobbied and contested heavily - it is already the law - we just got 12 months grace to comply before the ico would enforce it. 
</s><s>however, the ico have said they are unlikely to pursue a complaint about a website if they only use first party cookies for analytics purposes, providing clear information is provided about the usage of cookies.</s><s> this is a relatively recent development, but they are standing by the law and its not going away. 
</s><s>it also sounds like they will only respond to complaints, initially anyway - so they are not going to be on your doorstep banging on the door on 26th may! 
</s><s>updating privacy policies is not enough.</s><s> the ico have referenced that directly stating that "for the last 8 or so years website owners have put cookie usage information in privacy policies, which people rarely read" and they no longer consider that acceptable. 
</s><s>if using cookies for purely analytical purposes then it appears acceptable that you can just create a cookie information page and provide a clear link in the header or footer to the page.</s><s> the emphasis being not to hide it away in a privacy policy. 
</s><s>relating back to business catalyst, i raised a support request to ask what cookies are created and what they are used for so that i can create my cookie information page on a bc site ( i provided them the names of 5 cookies i noticed are created).</s><s> this was their reply.. 
</s><s>the cookies that you have provided are used for tracking purposes (analytics).</s><s> those cookies are set up for anonymous users (users that are not logging into a particular secure zone) and track the actions that they took on the front end of the site.</s><s> please note that those cookies are being removed once the customer close the browser and if he comes again then we will generate a different session id.</s><s> as for the last one "visitordeviceclass" this cookie we are setting up so that we can see from where the customer is accessing the site (desktop, tablet, phone etc.</s><s>) so that if you are using different templates for your site for each type of device to be able to render them accordingly. 

i also use google analytics on this bc site.</s><s> so, because all my cookies are for analytics and purely functional use, creating a cookie information page and providing a link to it clearly in the header or footer would (as i interpret it) be compliant - or in the words of the ico, a complaint would not likely be pursued against me if one was made. 
i certainly wouldn't agree with ricky's comment about it being 'up in the air, ambiguious and likely to change considerably'.</s><s> its days away, its clear enough whats required and by now you should have done or are doing something about it.

<s>it is funny, you said your correcting me but agreeing what i have said here and other threads.</s><s> it is up in the air.</s><s> 
</s><s>i got a creditiation for the report at uni on the topic of country law and regulations and locations of servers.</s><s> things like gambling sites etc. you even have net trulaity laws being passed in certain countries.</s><s> this is a very complex area ricky.</s><s> the thing you quoted is suggestive not absolute and google and co are working to get the eu law changed.</s><s> google drive, icloud, itunes, adobe creative cloud, dropbox all break not just this regulation in the eu because they are dumb. 
</s><s>there are several laws and laws in your country that super seed this cookie thing.</s><s> if you have a site in the au or nz for example and people view it in france you with the regulations and feedom you comply to in those countries you do not have to server stupid cookie information messaging.</s><s> reading the regulation documentation in full you can not even use offline storage and in fact if you want to meet the regulations in full you have to plaster your site informing people that the images and html and css files of your site and moreover javascript (because it has functionality) will be stored on your machine as cache. 
</s><s>this is why it is stupid on so many levels and will never be pushed. 
</s><s>like i said, a message in your terms and conditions and a link to agree to those when you sign up (which most sites do) is all you really need.</s><s> go to a site and see nothing mentioned about cookies an the same "agree to terms" tick and actually agreee to those you will see cookies and use mentioned in there as an update 
you also have things along this lines such as auto ticking for newsletter sign ups.</s><s> in say new zealand you are not allowed to have this ticked by default.</s><s> it has to be an opt in, not opt out.</s><s> in other countries you can, but in new zealand filling out a form, which regulation does the site have to comply to?</s><s> it often in most cases, as i mentioned falls on the sever location.</s><s> this becomes more complciated when you have states.</s><s> us for example has different laws per state and quite a variety.</s><s> and a lot of things form very complex regulations and what is "grey areas" 
</s><s>like i said, it is very likely this regulation will be dumbed down by the end of the year and just doing the terms update (which is what most companies have done, i bet if i read the next itunes terms it will have the paragraph about cookies) and it should be covered. 
</s><s>big companies are doing this and in terms of the adobe id that was all covered in several threads and are in regard to the fact your now on adobe id not just a business catalyst account.

<s>just a small note...</s><s> if you use 3rd party cookies, like facebook, addthis, youtube, etc, be ready to ask your users always, because asking only once is not enougth (contrary to first party cookies, like your own site cookies and google analytics). 
</s><s>also, i've noticed several notices stating that only 3 coutries have implemented it, which is a bit far from the truth: 
http://www.ffw.com/pdf/cookie-consent-tracking-table.pdf [just googled fresh "cookie-consent-tracking"]. 
</s><s>aditionaly, something that was ignored on my previous remark, the legislation doesn't state cookies, but information.</s><s> so if you use webstorage, flash storage, image with encodings, url with encodings or any other mean to convey information between requests, that also require authorization. 
</s><s>another part of the law that is being ignored is the implication on mobile devices (real state if very small, and apps also ask for permissions and don't state why or how they use those permissions). 
</s><s>so, yurp not a simple thing to swallow in one chunk. 
</s><s>and btw, i don't think you will get away with a simple opt-out... as some countries, mainly france are inclined to demand a opt-in. 
</s><s>ianal but i would advise to not only add an opt-in, but also log the answers for legal reasons.
