i have set up all my products on bc and before i go any further with designing my site i wanted to get this bit nailed, so any ideas?

<s>hi nathan / kidskorner, 
</s><s>thanks for the feedback on bc gurus.</s><s> i would like to help clarify a couple of elements: 
1) kiyuco is an alternative, and also bc sandpile has many presentations on varoius topics with bc. 
2) zero to hero training is available free to everyone and can be found here: http://bcgurus.com/hero - you do not need a standard or premium or even free partnership to view those tutorials.</s><s> that set of courses gives a complete overview of bc. 
3) they do not "entrust" us to provide training, we are a private company that does training for bc and we offer a great deal of that training for free which adobe links to.</s><s> we try to keep this training up to date, but bc does change fast and we are not compensated by adobe so it does take us some time to keep up with the changes.</s><s> we have over 30 instructors, so we know the experience can vary.</s><s> i am aware of the instructor you are referencing to.</s><s> we are working to possibly revamp some of that core content as we've gotten mixed feedback on his presentation skills. 
</s><s>we have a ton of premium tutorials available beyond our zero to hero training that are available for $49/month with new content coming out frequently.</s><s> bc is a big platform with a lot of different possible scenarios, so it is a constant evolving project to both provide new information and keep up with changes.</s><s> we have over 600 individual videos on bc gurus, so you can imagine this isn't just something you can "refresh" in a month because adobe changed a screen. 
</s><s>final note, we are in the process of upgrading the bc gurus site infrastructure and it will include a much improved search functionality either end of this month or soon after.

</s><s>sometimes i can cancel the upload-message and redo, then its working (75%). 
</s><s>as i seem to be the only one having this problem, i completely reinstalled the system and cc, but the problem still exists. 
i would really appreciate any help or support from adobe, although i must say, they already did a lot, but unfortunately my problem is not solved.

<post author="thetrickster888" timestamp="Jul 4, 2013 9:09 AM">
<s>incontext editing in dw was a solution unto itself but adobe stopped supporting it officially as an external plugin and decided it would exist solely on business catalyst. 
bc's dw integration does not include inserting ice like they do for modules and other tags in your layouts which is why you can't find any way to do it inside dw. 
</s><s>furthermore, ice is undergoing an overhaul and the next gen version of ice is still being worked out.</s><s> i wouldn't use that version yet for clients full on just yet but you can read more about the next gen version of ice on bc at http://forums.adobe.com/docs/doc-3201 
</s><s>basically, it's just some markup that you add to your html elements in your web page or page template.</s><s> you can also use the new ice in bc's email campaigns so that your clients can create new html email campaigns and edit the content of your email template where you want them to or add/insert new repeating regions that you setup for them. 
</s><s>here's more about the ice in the email campaigns: http://forums.adobe.com/docs/doc-2862 
i don't think you need to worry about including the ice javascript assets like you used to with the original ice... if you add the markup to your html or email campaigns it should work out of the box.

<s>hi lulian, 
</s><s>thanks for your speedy response. 
i agree its a really strange problem.</s><s> i run a web development hosting company which gives me an advantage on troubleshooting but it still took a while to figure this one out between me and a server tech reviewing server logs.. 
</s><s>this is dreamweaver cs6 connecting to an apache server with shared hosting account running the latest software updates.</s><s> i am connecting using the basic ftp settings in dreamweaver with passive and optimized unchecked.</s><s> i have been using dw for years like this without issue until now. 
</s><s>this happened on a few different hosting companies for different clients we have. 
</s><s>the steps are simple we are just connecting with the hosted account web folders through ftp and upload and download web files.</s><s> when we do this it is altering the permissions on the files and the folders to 0 and many files are not transferred and we have to reset the permissions on each. -not sure what you mean that ftp server prohibits setting permissions since we can simply right click on the folder/file in dreamweaver and set the permissions on the local or server side files.</s><s> for example a clients website is running fine but we have updated some simple content on the index.html page.</s><s> we do our updates and connect using dreamweaver through ftp and upload the file.</s><s> usually the file doesn't make through the ftp and the index.html is actually deleted off the server and the folders permissions have somehow been changed to 0.</s><s> we will change the folders permissions back and repeatedly try to upload that file. 
</s><s>now we switched to the ftp client "yummy ftp or transmit" and everything is transferred without a hitch. 
</s><s>this is a common occurrence after i read several posts on your adobe message boards on this exact error which led me to this email address.</s><s> like many of them i am forced to use a dedicated ftp client which has no issues but is not how i want to continue my workflow. 
</s><s>thanks again and tell me if you need anything else.</s><s> i am anxious to resolve this error in dreamweaver and get back to business.
