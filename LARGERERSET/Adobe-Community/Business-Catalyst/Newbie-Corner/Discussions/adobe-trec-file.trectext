<s>hi everyone, 
i've noticed that the contents of a blog on my website are coming up in the google search results.</s><s> the blog is being used to publish testimonials that are given by customers.</s><s> when someone goes to the website and they click on the testimonials link, they can see a page with all the testimonials on it.</s><s> the url for this testimonials page is: 
www.mysite.com/testimonials 
the problem is that in the google search results, if someone clicks on the link that comes up in the results, it goes to a different url, ie. 
www.mysite.com/_blog/testimonials/post/customer_name/ 
the url listed above is different from the page seen on the live site, ie. www.mysite.com/testimonials 
when i say it's different, i mean it's formatted differently and only shows the one post on the blog (ie. the one clicked on from google), whereas if someone goes to the testimonials page on the live site, they see a whole list of testimonials and the page is formatted differently. 
</s><s>in the backend of the site within business catalyst, i tried to find the page called: 
www.mysite.com/_blog/testimonials/post/customer_name/ 
...but i can't find it in the site files. 
</s><s>so i guess my question is, does business catalyst automatically create these one-page blog posts and if yes, where are they stored.</s><s> secondly, since the blog posts are coming up in the google search results, is there a way for the link to go directly to the testimonials page, ie. www.mysite.com/testimonials instead of the seemingly temporary url that business catalyst creates where there is only the one post on the page. 
</s><s>sorry if the above is at any way unclear but i'm struggling to understand all this. 
i really appreciate any help.

<s>thanks for the reply, 
yes that's right - we're on a plan that does not include web apps. 
i understand now that the layout of the blog can't be changed but is it possible to change the colour of the font?</s><s> the colour of the font used in the individual blog posts seems to have been set to black by default whereas it would be good to change this to a different colour and size.</s><s> so is it possible to get access to the css file that controls these things or is this another limitation due to the fact that we don't have web apps? 
</s><s>also, i noticed that the individual blog posts (ie. not the ones on the testimonials page) are being contained by an outer element.</s><s> this outer element is part of the overall layout of the site so i'm assuming that i would be able to change the colour of the outer element.</s><s> you were saying that there are different layouts for the blog posts which i've seen but the blog layout that's been used must have been inserted into the overall layout of the site so can you tell me where this page would be so i can change the colour of the outer element? 
</s><s>the page i'm referring to is the one that appears when i click the preview button in the blog. 
</s><s>thank you again for any further help.

<s>hey will neeteson lemkes,

<s>hi eric, 
</s><s>1) yes the admin can adjust the payment date or payment altogether.</s><s> they just need to access the order record and locate the payment info which is where you can edit and adjust as required. 
2) the system will automatically recur 14 days earlier but will not charge until the actual recurring invoice date. 
</s><s>how invoicing works to explain how the recurring invoicing works for your customers, consider a case where you have an order with an invoice date of 1/sep/09 and it's set on monthly recurring.</s><s> recurring orders are always recurred 14 days before the next invoice date.</s><s> so on the 16/sep/09, the next invoice will be created which will have a 1/oct/09 invoice date.</s><s> when it comes to charging an invoice, the timing of this is dictated by the field direct debit days (go to any order and click on recurrence/direct debit to see this field).</s><s> a value of 0 means the invoice is charged on the actual invoice date.</s><s> so your recurring order that is generated on 16/sep (with an invoice date of 1/oct) will be charged on 1/oct.</s><s> a value of 5 for this field, will charge this invoice 5 days after the invoice date, i.e.</s><s> 6/oct. you can disable invoices being sent to customers when an order is automatically recurred.</s><s> you cannot change the timing in which invoices will get emailed to customers other than turn it on or off for when orders are recurred.</s><s> please contact us if you wish to disable the emailing of invoices for recurred orders.

<s>hi, 
</s><s>have you ever worked with muse before?</s><s> if not, i would suggest learning the basics by following a few tutorials starting here: http://www.adobekb.com/ muse is simply design, it does help you to push a site live, but once integrated with bc it requires extended knowledge about the tags and modules in bc: http://kb.worldsecuresystems.com/134/bc_1342.html and http://kb.worldsecuresystems.com/134/bc_1345.html.</s><s> publishing with muse: http://www.adobekb.com/launching_pt01.html 
</s><s>"automatically be redirected to their languages pages based on their locale", if you mean by automatically that the site would "jump" to a specific domain once the location is detected, i assume this would require javascript on a landing page.</s><s> also this would require the set up of multiple domains or subdomains first to redirect the user to that domain. 
</s><s>this link here goes more in detail: http://kb.worldsecuresystems.com/521/bc_521.html i would imagine that muse could help you with the basic outline of the design of your site, but you would have to stop somewhere to integrate dynamic content in order for you to use the same templates with multi-language support.

i have created an english subfolder where the english site resides.</s><s> if you want to reuse content, images or video's you have to "point to" the directories where these documents are stored.

</s><s>in adobe dreamweaver or any html-editor i opened the html-pages by changing the codes that points to the directories images, assets, stylesheets and scripts. 
</s><s>i.e: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/site_global.css?259224851"/> had to be changed in <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../css/site_global.css?259224851"/> where the ../ "tells" that in the above directory /css the document can be found. 
this works the same with images and other documents.</s><s> i.e: <img id="u8668_img" src="images/apartement.jpg" had to be changed in <img id="u8668_img" src="../images/apartement.jpg"

<s>hi 
</s><s>the problem here is that the player uses a staylesheet called "drplayer.css", placed in your root folder, which overrides the standard styling of your page i've disabled some of the overalapping rules (you can see them greyed out) and now the page renders fine http://screencast.com/t/myz6qyms3aoc.
