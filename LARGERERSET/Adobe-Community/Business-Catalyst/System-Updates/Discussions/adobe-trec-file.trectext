<subject>Kudos on the File Manager Fixes!</subject>
<post author="Phil Lockwood - CC" timestamp="Mar 13, 2014 4:20 AM">
<s>as a group that prefers the "develop" file manager interface over dreamweaver, we're stoked about this week's bug fixes -- works perfectly now! 
</s><s>if you don't already use the file manager, you should consider giving it another try... 
</s><s>with the exception of auto-complete tags, it's faster than dreamweaver in most every way faster saving without the need to upload changes (manual or auto) faster access to module toolbox and data if you work in the admin while also working in dreamweaver, you'll notice that dreamweaver work logs you out of the admin.</s><s> not so if you use the file manager instead!</s><s> doesn't crash like dreamweaver.</s><s> doesn't display the spinning ball of death like dreamweaver (mac) doesn't require so much window swapping 
next, i'd love to see a "refresh" function for both the file structure (if you add a web app now, you have to switch to the manage view, then back to develop to see it listed in the "layouts" folder) and a refresh function for web app data fields. 
btw, if you don't know what the bugs were, they involved auto code intending issues and an odd window scroll jump when deselecting after a "select all".

<s>hi all,

</s><s>to be on the safe side i'm now copying the data from meta description into a custom 1 field in case it vanished again i can recopy and paste it back and not loose hours of rewriting etc. 
</s><s>plus i found the tag to show the more options-keywords on the pages too. 
</s><s>so what i've learnt (in case anyone else is as lost as me..</s><s>) don't touch product page properties.</s><s> (i'm going to go through and delete all mine) on the product large layout page have: <html> <head> <title>{tag_productmetatitle}</title> <meta content="{tag_productmetadescription}" name="description" /> <meta content="{tag_tags}" name="keywords" /> <meta content="{tag_productmetatitle}" property="og:title" /> <meta content="{tag_productmetadescription}" property="og:description" /> </head>

</s><s>but on a service like bc, which is generating dynamic pages, and where business owners and partners can create as many pages as they want from the admin interface, this model does not scale up anymore.</s><s> a far better solution is to have an editor that automatically detects areas of the page that are editable and make them available to a user that wants to make some updates.</s><s> and this is what we have started to do with the new incontext editor that is included in this release. 
i hope this clears out a little bit more for you.

<post author="Peter-AM" timestamp="Sep 17, 2012 10:27 PM">
<s>thanks mario, what is missing from the post and this notification is a fundamental pieces of information "times".</s><s> this is not just your info but also the release by jackson palmer on the blog - totally missed there also 
we need to be notified of the sceduled timing of this release not just a vague date which is not specific globally 25th but we are global - what time specifically 0100am pst is very different to 1030pm pst , the latter being 26th in au why - because campaigns scheduled for around this time can be impacted, and also if the sites go offile during the maintenance window campaigns can be a wasted exercise.</s><s> previously mid week schedules have been a matter of heated discussion, yet the support guys say that schedule ahas not been decided upon not planning is planning to fail, and we have witnessed that all to ofetn in the past.</s><s> bc unfortunately has a history of failing to plan and inform, and this does little to activate confidence in the community. 
i have discussed with dragos on numerous occassion how the missing ingridents at bc like communication, ux, planning and most importantly understanding from the customer perspective (rather than backroom coders). 
eg at 645am 26th of sept 2012 we have a email campaign scheduled ( and can be rescheduled ), the issue i see is without your maintenance window timings being published in a timely manner how can we tell if we move to a sooner or later timing.</s><s> you have to agree it is disasterious marketing to blast out a campaign and find systems down when customers open newsletter offers and want to shop then. 
</s><s>if the time schedule is listed somewhere else even more shame that it is overlooked as an inclusion here plus that chat team are not informed and kept up to date and the blog is just fluff sales and chest beating.</s><s> that is not support of partners regargless of paid or free status. 
</s><s>to much time is wasted with this sort of unthinking about unpublished / incomplete notifications, live chat guy wasted > 15 min of his and my time becuase they don't know either, how many others are being inconvenienced by fialing to plan and notify information to act upon, this communication in the blog is good info but by itself useless and creates more doubt and lack or faith.</s><s> just look at the "hope in the comments"

<s>hey there, same process as every release.</s><s> that date over that date.</s><s> will be we hours au and nz time for example so when you go in the office on 26th that is the time to check out the update.</s><s> times are never given because they do it asap and can span over the course of the day, be delayed before that date or even pulled due to an issue they find in testing over the coming days before the release.</s><s> over the course of the coming days and specifically on the release day patches and updates or again pulling of the release may occur.   i do not see any difference from this releases announcement then others.</s><s> in terms of what is happening key aspects of this release have been shown at say the au townhall meeting, and discussed in a variety of ways before release, especially with this one as it is the first of the new roadmap, outlined by bogdan a little while ago.   closer to the release specifics are outlined and during a release or any issue http://status.businesscatalyst.com is updated, as you can see with the last maintanance which took place.</s><s> of which we got emails about, as we do recent releases and now more recently when email issues for clients with the email servers occur.   new key features rolled out such as the tax rounding is not by default and activated by choice to allow management as a new thing again to avoid on release issues.</s><s> this was formed by posting and asking partners in the partner forums.   bigger updates are now shown off to partners who are able to help provide feedback and previewed, like jason of simpleflame with the new web app system due early next year spending a good amount of time on it and providing the team with feedback.   considering these and other things i think the above is a bit of an overaction.</s><s> last release i saw the breakdowns and progress etc and was quite happy with it.</s><s> today is 18th of september, not the day before the release.</s><s> i appreciated the detailed heads up at this stage and more detail about it will follow.

<s>we are announcing a new business catalyst release, scheduled to go live on january 22nd, 2013. 
</s><s>please refer to our official blog post for feature highlights and other major improvements slated for this release.</s><s> minor enhancements and cosmetic improvements grid state persistence - with this release, most of the item lists displayed in the new admin user interface will remember the page and the sorting applied on a list when returning from a detail page edit page properties in the new file manager - when editing a page in the new file manager, users can now edit the page properties like seo metadata, workflows, or page visibility updated email marketing wizard - we have simplified the email campaign wizard and merged the type and details step into a single one, updated the controls for setting up one-off and loyalty campaigns and moved the email campaign subject into the content tab secure domain redirects - starting with this release, all sites will have this feature turned on; if you redirect users to external websites, you should add those into the secure domain redirect list spam improvements - comment workflow emails are no longer sent when a comment is marked as spam limit the comment size - starting with this release we will be limiting the number of characters per comment to 4000 url redirects have been moved from page details into site settings menu display how many subscribers are into a secure zone in the secure zone list view renamed advanced view tab from pages screen into list view and made it default for new sites after sending a campaign, don't show an error when redirected to the stats tab site manager > pages - advanced view buttons don't have the same height.</s><s> might be reproducible in other screens as well.</s><s> updated styling for find a customer link found in some crm screens updated styling for date picker in filters fixed icons alignment in the left menu + redesign some icons to be more relevant to the menu entry fixed footer spacing in some screens (it's not always the same) page status (draft/live) was sometimes shown in grey table list headers font-size is not the size in specs (all over the ui) consistency improvements for links color (we had 5 different tones of blue, now we have just one as in specs) site manager > page details - breadcrumb has the correct caption pages instead of web pages web forms field categories wrap on the second line when the window is resized although the screen is optimized for low resolutions screens.</s><s> wizard tabs have different colors depending on the screen.</s><s> issues fixed by january release 
issue # description 3157574 updated catalog import to fix an issue causing the import to generate incorrect urls when more than one sub catalogs were created 3164429 enforced shipping tax validation to prevent site customers from bypassing the shipping tax payment 3343967 updated the site setting > file manager to prevent users from creating folders that contain # in their name 3365127 fixed an issue on list views that was causing an incorrect datetime sort (was sorting alphabetically by date instead of actual date) 3373342 fixed an issue that intermittently generated an error when when accessing the bc toolbox panel, via the admin console 3377475 updated secure zone login to prevent an "secure zone access expired" error being displayed when trying to log in a secure zone in some cases 3430574 fixed an issue causing mucommander to corrupt files on upload using sftp 3430529 fixed a file system issue that was not preventing sftp clients from retrieving missing or corrupt files on the remote storage and overwrite the client local files 3428565 fixed an issue preventing users from connecting to sites on sftp, using fireftp 3430571 fixed some issues causing cuteftp and mucommander for mac to corrupt files on upload 2908470 updated {tag_recipientfirstname} so that it will render an empty string instead of "recipient" if first name is empty 2567870 updated the dynamic menu sorting functionality to fix an issue that was causing menu items to intermittently skip a few places 2567955 fixed an issue causing state tax to not be covered by the gift voucher payments on some occasions 2567515 fixed an issue causing the web app edit layout to not populate checkboxes that have the ampersand & in the name 2753571 creating a new free shipping type option hides all other pre-configured shipping options in front-end for all the sub-domains of a website 3227500 fixed "add rss channels to a webpage" and "get rss html code" links from the "actions" dropdown list in the new admin user interface 3344567 fixed an issue preventing the get rss html code link from working on the new admin user interface 3220522 returning url for dibs payment gateway blank 3217223 fixed an issue causing incorrect data to be displayed when using affiliate program tags: {tag_referralslastmonth} and {tag_referralslastweek} 3343296 fixed a an issue causing the line item descriptions displayed on a packaing slip layout to be mis-aligned 2801224 updated tag_productlist sorting.</s><s> the sortby parameter can now accept "releasedate" and "expirydate" parameters.</s><s> we also added the ability to sort ascending or descending for any sort type.</s><s> example: in order to sort by release date ascending, use "releasedate asc".</s><s> in order to order by expiry date descending use "expirydate desc" or simply "expirydate" which will work as before (dates are descending by default). 
</s><s>deprecated functionality {tag_tellafriend} and {tag_tellafriendurl} will no longer be available for use in email campaigns.</s><s> existing campaigns will continue to work as designed.
