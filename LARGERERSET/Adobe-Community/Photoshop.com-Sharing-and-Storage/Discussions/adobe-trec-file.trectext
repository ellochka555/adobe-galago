<s>thanks for the feedback, it has been very frustrating coming from the other mode at photoshop.com where it uploaded by the filename which if you use a date format like 20130415 then they are all in sequence.</s><s> in this case i have several categories of pictures e.g. flowers, scenery, waterfalls etc. with dates as stated so they mix.</s><s> i went back and renumbered all the filenames starting at 1 to 100+ but arranging like 1 Ð 12 as flowers and 13 Ð 25 waterfalls so they would be grouped but as you say since you are looking at the date of the photo they are all over the map.</s><s> in photoshop.com i can load them then drag and drop to the view sequence i want.</s><s> i would vote for that method not using the filename or date of the actual photo. 


</s><s>is there any way i can arrange these now without revel looking at the photo taken date? 


</s><s>another option i've lost is the ability to have a description under the photo when it plays in the slide presentation.</s><s> photoshop.com gave me the ability to have description free form under each photo.</s><s> this was great for letting views have a little bit information about the photo. 


</s><s>by the way when you migrated me over there were many albums that didn't come across as albums just random pictures.</s><s> it was such a mess not having them in their individual albums that i just deleted them all and have started uploading to new albums in revel so the migration you did was a waste of time.</s><s> oh and some albums without photo's in them came over but without the photos in them so i just deleted them too and started over-so much for the migration 


</s><s>again thanks for responding so quickly, looking forward to some of these improvements "soon".

<s>this has really got me going such that i woke several times in the night thinking about all the capabilities i am losing going to revel. 


</s><s>question: have you used photoshop.com if you have then you would know right off what i'm going to high level relate to you below.</s><s> it really is sad we are taking such a huge step backwards with this conversion. 


</s><s>features in photoshop.com that i do not see in revel: 
1) revel does not have any photo or album editing capabilities as i see it.</s><s> following is a screen print of the pull down at the photo level that displays all the options i have at the photo level.</s><s> it is similar at the album level too. 




2) you do not allow .</s><s>wmv format files.</s><s> this is a real bummer as i use this to arrange pictures in an album adding information slides and music.</s><s> follow this link and you'll get an example of what i mean. http://www.photoshop.com/users/astrong29/albums/9e63c13a0a804ed3a48f68 3eecac12a6 click on the "slideshow" to start it and see what i mean-very powerful. 
3) photoshop.com allows you to select a photo out of the album to use as the cover photo of the album to be displayed along with the title. 
4) in photoshop.com i have 2gb of space free that i manage.</s><s> how much is available in revel and how do i view the space utilization at any given time? 
5) when anyone goes to my photoshop.com gallery they are presented with a main gallery album first that i select out of the posted albums and it plays slides from the album.</s><s> following is the link to my photoshop.com gallery, let me know what you think j http://www.photoshop.com/users/astrong29 
6) under online tools the photoshop express organizer is the mode where i do all my work from creating an album, uploading the pictures and organizing them (drag and drop) into the album the way i want it to be displayed not just in picture date order like revel does. 


</s><s>hope this has been helpful.</s><s> i would appreciate any feedback you have as to when or if we will see any of these features in revel especially the .</s><s>wmv format and allow my own picture sequencing within an album. 


</s><s>thanks-.looking forward to hearing back from you.

<s>pattie, 


</s><s>new challenge-.because the album i created hoping to have several themes in it but they were all mixed in because of their creation dates, i deleted the album and decided to create an individual album per theme.</s><s> i created an album titled "creatures" and tried uploading just those photos related to this theme, i did add one new photo that had not been up loaded before and it did load.</s><s> after the process of 17 picture uploads completed i received the message that 17 pictures were bypassed as they were duplicates. 


</s><s>what is going on?</s><s> there are no other albums/pictures loaded but revel seems to remember it has seen the other 17 pictures before so will not upload them.</s><s> how do i reinitialize revel or whatever it takes so it will allow me to create new albums with pictures i have previously uploaded but have been deleted as far as i can see?

<s>nope, just below that post, i posted the information below.Ê by the way, which part are you feeling cut off from by having a pc.</s><s> other than editing, adoberevel.com for pc has nearly all of the same features as the apps do.

<s>sorry guess somehow i'm not seeing all the great information you are providing. 


</s><s>let me start again, i thought i could edit right in adoberevel.com mode.</s><s> i do have other editing features in xp and photoshop elements v8 that i have.</s><s> yes then i can import into an album but then the "arrange" and "tag" features disappear.</s><s> i like to have my pictures sometimes tell a story so arranging them in the sequence i want not by creation date is required.</s><s> second being able to provide a tag or description under the picture when displayed in the slide show in then needed.</s><s> and of course i've mentioned using windows movie maker to make my own slide show with added music and extra informational slides inserted. 


</s><s>so for now there is no editor for pc users within revel, correct? 


</s><s>from the information i've told you what exactly has been submitted for enhancements to revel for pc users? 


</s><s>how long do you think it will be before any of these added features may become a usable feature for pc users? 


</s><s>thanks again for all your help and sorry i haven't been seeing everything you have provided first round.

<s>so in fact the email advice you sent out to likely thousands of users who, like me, signed up for the app and tried it in the past, without apparently needing a photoshop.com id, was completely useless, and it's taken you several weeks to work that out?
