<subject>Troubleshooting 101: Export to .idml or .inx to clear file corruption</subject>
<post author="Peter Spier" timestamp="Apr 3, 2012 9:23 PM">
<s>sometimes a particular indesign file may behave badly (if all your files are doing strange things, see replace, or "trash" your indesign preferences ).</s><s> in such cases the first thing to try is export to .inx if you have cs, cs2 or cs3(indesign interchange format) by selecting file > export- and choosing .inx from the file type dropdown, or if you have cs5 or later export to .idml.</s><s> the resulting file should then be opened in id and saved as a new .indd file. 

</s><s>interchange format was set up to allow users to open files in a version of id one release earlier (minus, of course, new features) than the one in which they were created.</s><s> it reduces the file to the bare minimum of information needed to recreate the layout, and as a side effect it often strips out minor corruption that will cause strange behavior but is not bad enough to prevent the file from opening.</s><s> other things interchange format can help with are removal of stubborn unused swatches and references to missing plugins. 

</s><s>the .idml (indesign markup) format was introduced in cs4 and in that version you have your choice (.inx is listed as cs3 interchange) and is the replacement for .inx going forward.</s><s> my non-scientific intuition says that .idml is slighlty less effective than .inx at solving problems, so i would opt for .inx in cs4 as my first choice, but i also would not dismiss .idml out of hand if i suspect document corruption.

<subject>Troubleshooting 101: Replace, or "trash" your InDesign preferences</subject>
<post author="Peter Spier" timestamp="Feb 24, 2014 3:17 PM">
<s>when indesign starts to behave strangely, the number one suggestion for troubleshooting is to replace (or trash, reset or restore) the application preferences.</s><s> this will remove corrupt preferences and replace them with a new set of default preferences, and often end bad behavior.   there is a quick and easy method for doing this using the keyboard: close and relaunch indesign, and immediately hold down ctrl + alt + shift (windows) or cmd + ctrl + opt + shift (mac), and respond in the affirmative to the dialog asking if you really want to replace the preferences.</s><s> there are two downsides to this method, however.</s><s> first, you must be extremely fast on the keyboard (if you don't see the confirmation prompt, you were too slow), and second, anytime you replace the preferences you will lose most program customizations, and using the keyboard method leaves you with no backup to restore them when the problem turns out to be something else.   my preferred method is to close indesign and do a "manual" prefs replacement, which consists of finding and renaming the two files which make up the preference set: indesign defaults and indesign saveddata.</s><s> both of these files should be replaced at the same time.</s><s> you can delete them, but renaming or moving them will give you the opportunity to copy them back in the event that new prefs doesn't cure your issue.</s><s> when you restart id, the program will look for these two files, and when they are not found, a new default set will be written.   note: the indesign team is collecting corrupted preference files to investigate related issues.</s><s> please share your corrupted preferences files with the team here: http://adobe.ly/1jv2b7n   these are normally hidden files, so you will need to set your system to show them.</s><s> they will be found in various places depending on the os, and the version of indesign.</s><s> (edit: for mac users running osx 10.7 or newer, you can learn how to show hidden files here: access hidden user library files | mac os 10.7 lion)   indesign defaults: windows xp: c:\documents and settings\<user>\application data\adobe\indesign\<version #>\<language>\  (note: prior to version 6 [cs4] the language folder is not used).</s><s> windows vista or windows 7: c:\users\<user>\appdata\roaming\adobe\indesign\<version #>\<language>\ (note: prior to version 6 [cs4] the language folder is not used).</s><s> macintosh: hard drive/users/<user>/library/preferences/adobe indesign/<version #>/<language>/(note: prior to version 6 [cs4] the language folder is not used).   indesign saveddata: windows xp: c:\documents and settings\<user>\local settings\application data\adobe\indesign\<version #>\<language>\caches\ (note: prior to version 6 [cs4] the language folder is not used).</s><s> windows vista or windows 7: c:\users\<user>\appdata\local\adobe\indesign\<version #>\<language>\caches\  (note: prior to version 6 [cs4] the language folder is not used).</s><s> macintosh: hard drive/users/<user>/library/caches/adobe indesign/<version #>/<language>/ (note: prior to version 6 [cs4] the language folder is not used).   in some earlier versions of id, indesign saveddata may also be found in the first directory.   as mentioned above, when you replace your preferences you will lose customizations beyond those things that are set in the preferences dialogs.</s><s> these include document and print presets you might have created.</s><s> if you haven't made backups already, you should go, prior to replacing the preferences, to the "define" dialogs for printer and document presets and custom stroke styles, and select all of your custom entries, the click the save button and put the file someplace safe.</s><s> after resetting preferences using the keyboard or by renaming/deleting the old files and restarting indesign, these customized settings can be re-loaded with a single click once again in the define dialogs.     pdf presets can be backed up in the same way, but they are stored in a different location and will not be destroyed by a simple preference reset.</s><s> other customizations that you should not lose are workspaces, keyboard shortcut sets, and find/change queries.   as a further step i strongly recommend that you make a copy of these two files when you have a working customized set.</s><s> store them in a safe place and you can use them to overwrite a corrupt set so no further editing or reloading will be required.</s><s> users of indesign cs4 can use a free script from intools.com to backup and store multiple sets of preferences: in-tools scripts " preference manager script   edit: corrected mac path per jongware's post below.   update: i just ran across a situation in which overwriting the indesign defaults and indesign saveddata files failed to restore functionality to the tools on a single user account on a multiple user system (the other account was fine).</s><s> this is an absolute first and i've been using the technique for years, including replacing these two files on this system which is used by the student newspaper where i was a professor, in order to customize or restore preferences every semester.</s><s> what did work was to use the keyboard method first, then close indesign and manually replace the two files to restore the prefs to the proper settings.  -- peter

<s>(but the preview is still affected) 
</s></quote>when there's transparency on the page the soft proof is via the transparency blend space profile-your document's cmyk profile if it is cmyk.</s><s> it's the same as turning on overprint preview.</s><s> if your placed image is rgb the preview is showing you what will happen when it converts to document cmyk. 
</s><s>in photoshop you can get the same preview by setting the working cmyk profile to match your id profile and turning on proof colors.

<subject>IDCS6/IDCC MACOSX 10.6 and up: Inability to create tagged PDF during "Export PDF" in Data Merge</subject>
<post author="cdflash" timestamp="Mar 21, 2014 6:10 PM">
<s>i have a rather odd question concerning an obscure feature of indesign but have to ask it concerning a somewhat over-engineered solution to an ongoing problem.</s><s> i will try to give an abridged version but forgive me if i ramble... 
i have a solution that splits a large pdf based on bookmarks in the document.</s><s> the indesign file doesn't use bookmarks itself; but has paragraph styles that have been tagged using the expert tagging feature of the paragraph style.</s><s> once in acrobat, i am able to make new bookmarks from structure and voila... bookmarks that were based on tags. 
</s><s>for this solution to work, a checkbox in the general window of the export pdf dialog box called "create tagged pdf" needs to be checked 

</s><s>this checkbox is normally available when exporting pdfs from indesign.</s><s> however, when attempting to export pdf from the data merge panel, the dialog changes. 
</s><s>the parts highlighted in green i expect to change; but the red change is unexpected and for my purposes, fouls up what i'm trying to do. 
i should stress that if the data merge file is merged to one large new indesign file, then this problem doesn't happen.</s><s> however, the amount of data that i'm dealing with (tens of thousands of records) would take too much time and be double-handling. 
</s><s>is this greying out of the checkbox a glitch; is it intentional; or am i missing something? 
</s><s>concerning alternative ways of making bookmarks from a data merged pdf: 
i have tried using manual bookmarks applied to form fields and only the actual words that were made as a bookmark appear in the pdf; merging to a new indesign file is not an option given the record lengths that i work with (from 10,000 - 100,000) acrobat does have a way of automatically tagging an untagged document; however the results have been less than desirable so far.</s><s> there are a few third party applications for acrobat that allow dynamic bookmarks based on type in certain positions, but many of these applications are windows based.</s><s> mac compatible pdf-sam looks promising but have had no testimonials on whether or not tasks like mine are possible.</s><s> colin

<s>i do not use picas, so i cannot comment on how useful they would be.</s><s> 6p0 would be equivalent to 1 inch, or 72 points.   i use points beacuse: it is the same unit of measure for the text (font size in points) at 72 points per inch, it is roughly equivalent to the pixel resolution on images (72 pixels per inch).</s><s> i can adjust things by points, where each point equals 0.01389 inches.</s><s> it is easier to adjust by adding 1 or more points than by large decimals of inches, even though the dialog boxed can do the math for you.</s><s> if you need to set something as a scale in inches, you can still enter that number into any field, and the field will convert it for you, enter 1.25 in, and you get 90 points.   still, it is my personal preference.</s><s> it is not the only way to do things.   -mt   ps: when you set the preference using the rules, you are setting the document preference.</s><s> though, each ruler can be different.  for instance you can have inches vertical and picas horizontal.

<s>it is not a bug, though at first glance it may seem to be.

<s>consider the professional benefits of knowing and using the pica (and its sub-unit, points) measurement system: 
1.</s><s> postscript computer drawing language is founded on picas/points at 6 picas per inch / 12 points per pica / 72 points per inch.</s><s> therefore, all the math within indesign is most accurate at its native measurement system. 
2.</s><s> bear in mind that this electronic-era pica/point system is different (slightly, at 72.27 points to the inch) from the pica system of metal typesetting days. 
3.</s><s> why use it if north americans are born and raised on inches?</s><s> why use it if europeans are familiar with the metric system?</s><s> (and i'm not trying to define all parts of the globe ... this is just a rough illustration.</s><s>) the main benefit is the simplicity of math that is based on sixes and twelves as opposed to twos and fours (inches) and tens (metric).</s><s> a unit of measure based on sixes and twelves can easily be divided by 2, 3, and 4. this makes a tri-fold brochure or a three-column newsletter easier to measure.</s><s> ask yourself: have you ever measured a third of an inch?</s><s> likely no!</s><s> imperial inches often bring you to fractions like 11/32.</s><s> can you type that into a dialog box field easily?</s><s> no!</s><s> can you divide an 8.5 x 11 inch page easily into thirds without painful repeating decimal inches.</s><s> no again!</s><s> can you even calculate that in your head?</s><s> my experience says no, you cannot.</s><s> but it is all easy, whole numbers when you use picas. 
4.</s><s> professionals in the printing and graphic design industry in the us where i live commonly work in picas/points and are natively comfortable with inches, too.</s><s> maybe you should consider the two to be close cousin measurement systems, affording simple math advantages sometimes in one; sometimes in the other.</s><s> it is trivial in at least two ways to change the measurement system of any document: either right-click the ruler's zero point, or type the explicit measurement system into a dialog box field.</s><s> there is even a shortcut for it (cmd+opt+shift+u, i think.</s><s>) 
</s><s>i have to comment on the claim that you haven't come across picas since 1998. as the native measurement system of all postscript adobe software, it is certainly not dead.</s><s> it is a reborn innovation.</s><s> the fact that many aren't using it simply indicates the enormous paucity of education in our industry.</s><s> with the 1980s, many seasoned folks retired when computers came along.</s><s> the next generations were mainly self-taught, and this has left big experience gaps for us all to re-discover. 
</s><s>next time you encounter picas/points, give them a hug, why don't you?</s><s>!</s><s>

<s>you should have told us the version of id you have so we know what features are available to you.</s><s> alway tell us the version of the programs you are using and your os. 
i can think of no way to automate this.</s><s> you can use grep styles to apply a no-break character style to a sentence, but that will prevent the sentence from breaking at any line ending.</s><s> indesign can't tell the difference between line breaks, whether they are in the same column or in a diffent column, a different text frame, or on a different page. 

</s><s>your request is strange.</s><s> i understand not wanting just one or two words in the next column, but i have never known someone to want to keep all words in a sentence together when breaking columns.</s><s> i do notice that articles in canada's globe and mail that continue from page a1 often continue at the end of a sentence.</s><s> but then, that's when continuing on another page, not just flowing from one column to the next.</s><s> in fact, i think it would be easier for the reader to grok that the story continues in the next column if she is in the middle of a sentence. 

</s><s>you can use grep styles to apply no-break to the last few words or x characters of a paragraph.</s><s> it is tricky and you should ask for help doing that with a new post so you can state the problem specifically.</s><s> i suggest a post title like, "cs4: use grep styles to apply no-break to last 4 words of a paragraph." clearly stated problems in the subject line, including the version number, have several benefits: responders can see your problem with a glance at the forum page and those knowing the solution know to read your post since they know they have the answer; and once your problem is solved, other readers can see that your question is answered and can read your thread instead of posting the question again and waiting for a response.</s><s> that last one, of course, requires people to search the forum, which nobody does because the forum is so terribly designed.

<s>i'm sure it could be scripted, but i wouldn't know where to start. 
</s><s>also, i'd have to agree with scott that it is a somewhat odd solution for the widow/orphan/runt problem.</s><s> one word of overflow, yes i can understand how ugly that is, but it makes no sense to me to want to force entire sentences to a new column when, really, forcing a few more words over, or tightening up a bit to pull that one word back, would achieve a similar result without nearly as much effort or thought.</s><s> because, if one word of overflow pushes an entire sentence to the next column, you're going to have some very ragged-looking columns.</s><s> or some of your columns/pages are going to end quite prematurely. 
</s><s>upon reflection, i bet that script wouldn't be that hard to start - it would count characters from the last period to the end of the frame or column, and from the beginning of the next frame or column, and then dither for a bit, and then start replacing spaces with nonbreaking spaces until it reflowed the text.</s><s> however, i think that this is a decision that should not be automated.</s><s> a human, with a decent eye for type, can do far better by looking at text composition and inserting an occasional nonbreaking space where reflow is called for.</s><s> trying to robot-ize the process of making column or page breaks pleasing to the eye (without unduly affecting the many other criteria of decent-looking text composition) sounds like a fascinating project for a mathematically-inclined artist working a double-major graphic design/computer science degree.

</s><s>this thread seems to be heavy on the fit-pitching, to be honest.</s><s> a good workflow will sometimes require conventions that will make light work of some particular task that, in other workflows, would require vast amounts of manual clicking-about.</s><s> but this is a convention.</s><s> you get to choose what value you have set for this behavior.</s><s> it's hard to figure out, but that's what you get when you work in a decade-old page-layout app with buckets of functionality.</s><s> there are lacunae and dead ends and almost-impossible-to-find toggles that will affect everything in your layout.</s><s> there are features that are inaccessible by any means but scripting.</s><s> it's kind of a mess sometimes, but despite the steep learning curve and the abandonded feature-sets that haven't seen a lick of new code since 2006, this app is the industry standard, so it's best to just clamber up the steep learning curve and remember that one person's counterintuitive stumbling block is another person's most important feature. 
</s><s>like daniel just said, i have a suite of things i do to every document to test it for, um, funkiness.</s><s> i have some carefully groomed preflight profiles in both id and acrobat that help me find the stuff that will be problematic.</s><s> i have scripts that act as blink comparitors, scripts that color invisible objects with magenta, scripts that unlock all objects, and so on.</s><s> rather than fire off missives about what ought to be default, i suggest that you figure out a way to make the app work for you.</s><s> i bet that it would take me about fifteen minutes to write the startup script that would always set this value in the direction that you want it set for every document that you touch, and i am a very slow script developer.

<s>hi bob and everyone else, 
</s><s>i saw your really helpful post on the adobe forum about an indesign file that won't open in cs5 due to missing plug ins, or maybe the original was created in indesign cs5.5, we don't know. 
i am trying to help a journalism student with his project (exam is monday) and when i try to open his indesign file i get the following messages: 
this document users one or more plug-ins which are not currently available on your system: sharedcontent.indesignplugin 
and when i continue, a second alert lists the following missing plug-ins: 
formfield.indesignplugin xml.indesignplugin generic page item.indesignplugin text.indesignplugin dynamic documents.indesignplugin hyperlinks.indesignplugin document framework.indesignplugin graphics.indesignplugin 
and it says: please upgrade your plug-ins to their latest versions, or upgrade to the latest version of adobe indesign. 
i cannot see anywhere to upgrade my plug-ins, and cannot afford to upgrade from cs5. 
</s><s>so does this mean the original document was created in indd cs5.5? 
</s><s>or can i download the relevant plug-ins from somewhere? 
</s><s>or can you someone very kindly convert it to cs5 for me please?</s><s> i do have a dropbox. 
</s><s>many thanks
