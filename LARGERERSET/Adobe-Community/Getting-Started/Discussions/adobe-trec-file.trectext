<subject>How can i create an expanding rainbow?</subject>
<post author="Victor Codesseira" timestamp="Nov 23, 2013 8:31 AM">
<s>hey, i've just started using flash and thought that it would be an easy thing to do.</s><s> i've made it in multiple layers, and don't know if it's the right way, but the thing is that i want it to loop around, and when it starts the last colors to enter don't let the first appear, even if i repeat them in the timeline.</s><s> i understand why this is happening (the last colors are on the first layers, and are on front of the others), but i want to know how to solve it.</s><s> do i have to use coding or can i make it only with the graphic options of the program, like scaling and editing the timeline?</s><s> i'll add the .fla archive for better understanding.</s><s> i also know that it must be really easy to do, but i started today, and all i have done so far are moving balls on the screen. https://www.dropbox.com/s/0pz7uubirjx3b08/rainbow.fla 
edit: i wasn't getting any replies so i thought it could be because of lack of information, and so i added the video of how it is now.
