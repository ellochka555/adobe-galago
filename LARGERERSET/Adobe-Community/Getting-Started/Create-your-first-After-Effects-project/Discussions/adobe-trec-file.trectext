<s><quote>
<s>> so, what does that mean? 
</s></quote>it means that in after effects cs5 and earlier, you need to take extra steps.</s><s> one way---if you've already done the trimming in the footage panel---would be to create an empty composition first and then use the insert edit button at the bottom of the footage panel to insert the trimmed asset. 
<quote>
<s>> a new composition should be comprised of the segment selected, right? 
</s></quote>
</s><s>in after effects cs5.5 (10.5) and later, yes.</s><s> that's why we made the change; it made this much easier. 
<quote>
<s>> should i use some other tutorial? 
</s></quote>most aspects of this tutorial are the same for after effects cs5 (10.0) as for after effects cc (12.0) 
</s><s>i'd recommend that you use the more recent versions of the application, though, since there are many improvements and fixes since after effects cs5 (10.0).
