<s>@doc, you have a lot of question in this post, so let's start with just a few of them: * the lightroom library that's created on installation (called the catalog) does not contain your images.</s><s> it is essentially a database containing data that describes edits you've made to your photos, along with metadata, which you can use to organize them 
* finding existing images on your computer: if you get a chance, please check out the first video on https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/learn/start/lightroom.html

<subject>How can I get my files back in their proper folders in Windows Explorer?</subject>
<post author="amhey" timestamp="Dec 21, 2013 1:32 PM">
<s>for over 10 years i have meticulously put my photos in folders according to month, event.Ê so a folder is in directory labeled 2013, with i've successfully used adobe bridge to browse, edit, final edit in photoshop. Ê now i use lightroom and everything is put into a lightroom catalog with weird numbers on the folders and all my pictures have vanished from my carefully created folders on windows explorer? Ê how do i put the pictures back to where they were - short of going to my backup files. Ê also since using lightroom, photoshop is hanging saying it is waiting for network i/o threads - so i cannot save (on my own disk - why photoshop cc should look at the network for every task beats me - i had about 5 threads waiting on the network). Ê Ê all i'm trying to do is find my best 12 pictures from 2013 to make a christmas letter and i've already spent a whole evening trying to get this to work. Ê is this how lightroom works, or is it a terrible bug, or is there an option to not move the original files when making a lightroom catalog? Ê i am a single user, so don't need sharing, network, workflow. Ê i only want lightroom to point to my files, not to move them.Ê maybe i should go back to bridge?

<s>i discovered a wonderful blog that explained: lightroom is a database and it holds the pictures bridge is a browser that browses files on the disk 
i'm getting used to lightroom, even though i have many pictures because i organize them and only look at recent ones, it does seem that bridge is better for me - so i am not locked into adobe's database.

<s>hi graham, 
</s><s>if you downloaded the start_lightroom-manage-photos.zip file, it needs to be un-zipped before you can use the raw dng photos within it.</s><s> also, it sounds like you are on a mac?</s><s> if so, it's true, the preview program will not know how to open the .zip file.</s><s> you simply double-click it, and the mac should de-compress it and the raw files will be inside the new folder that's created.</s><s> lightroom can import and preview the dng files, but preview cannot open them. 
</s><s>does this help?

<subject>Why is my preview area showing only greyed out boxes instead of photos?</subject>
<post author="Kellyy8" timestamp="Oct 26, 2013 7:51 AM">
<s>i am unable to import my photos so they can be seen.</s><s> whether i try to import them from the hard drive, camera card, or my desktop (following the tutorial), i do not see photographs in the preview area, only greyed out boxes instead of photos.</s><s> if i imported 6 photos, i have six greyed out (photo-sized) boxes.</s><s> the specific photos are there somehow, becuase they are properly named when i scroll the mouse over them, but i see only flat grey, no pictures.</s><s> as i said, this happens even when i follow the tutorial and import from my desktop.

<s>george, 
</s><s>i appreciate you responding to my inquiry.</s><s> we (that would be the "royal" we, which would be my husband) finally determined that the monitor was not configured properly.</s><s> "we" discovered this out after uninstalling and reinstalling lightroom several times. 
</s><s>to answer your question, i was trying to import both photos taken in jpeg, as well as raw, both were problematic.</s><s> i could import no images.</s><s> it was interesting that i could tell all of the data was coming over (when i floated the cursor over a grayed-out box i could read the data), just not the images. 
i have a nikon d5100.</s><s> i purchased lightroom 5.0 just before now(two days ago), and was trying to install and play with it.</s><s> i upgraded to 5.2 as i was going into it for the first time (it is an automatic question).</s><s> i knew there was obviously a problem when i couldn't see any images.</s><s> particularly when i went into the tutorials -- it just reemphasized that something was wrong.</s><s> who ever thinks of how their monitor is configured?</s><s>?</s><s>?</s><s>?</s><s>?</s><s> 
</s><s>thank you for following up.</s><s> i was very frustrated for many, many hours.

<s>@montanamaryd., here's what i suggest: 1) make sure you have lightroom 5 installed. if not, go here and download it (if this is your first creative cloud install, you will be prompted to download and install the creative cloud app first) 2) download the file with the sample images from here.</s><s> unzip it.</s><s> 3) go back to http://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/learn/start/lightroom.html, scroll down the page and watch the videos in sequence, starting with the organize your photos video
