<post author="Michelle%20Yaiser" timestamp="Jul 25, 2013 10:37 AM">
<s>frames in indesign can contain only one image at a time.</s><s> from what you wrote above, i think you are replacing the image each time you click in the selected frame. 
</s><s>to place multiple images they should: click and drag out a new frame for each image in the place gun queue click in different part of the document to place the images in the queue at full image size 
as to the question about the target in the middle of the image box: this is the "content grabber".</s><s> its a control that allows you to easily select and manipulate the content within an image frame without the need to select the frame first, double click, then act on the content. 
</s><s>hope this helps.
