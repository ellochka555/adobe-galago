<s>hi andreas, 
</s><s>this may be related to the same problem you reported with the location pitch.pptx document.</s><s> if neither of my suggestions in your previous post helped fix that, let me know and i'll look into other alternatives. 
i was able to download the files for this tutorial and make them work, so hopefully it's just a matter of downloading the .zip file again.

<s>hi andreas, 
</s><s>do you have powerpoint on your machine?</s><s> if so, are you able to successfully open the pptx file directly within powerpoint?</s><s> if so, perhaps the zip file got corrupted during download? 
</s><s>maybe you can try: 
</s><s>1. downloading the zip again.</s><s> 2. downlading the pptx directly from this link (i uploaded it to my personal web server): 
http://empress-media.net/creativecloud/gettingstarted/acrobat/location pitch.pptx 
i hope that helps.
