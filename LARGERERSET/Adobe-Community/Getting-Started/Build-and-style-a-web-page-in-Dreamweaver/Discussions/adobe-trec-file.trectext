<post author="David_Powers" timestamp="Mar 7, 2014 11:04 AM">
<s>styles are applied automatically to elements by the selectors used in the style sheet.</s><s> if styles aren't being applied as you expected, there could be a number of reasons.</s><s> one common reason for styles not being applied is spelling ids or class names incorrectly.</s><s> they are case-sensitive.</s><s> another reason is that the style is being overridden by another. 
</s><s>css stands for "cascading style sheets".</s><s> styles "cascade" down, and are applied cumulatively.</s><s> if two conflicting styles apply to the same element, the basic rule is that the style lower down the style sheet overrides the earlier one.</s><s> however, some selectors are more powerful (have higher "specificity") than others.</s><s> an id takes precedence over a class, and a class takes precedence over a tag (or type) selector. 
</s><s>it's a complex subject that can't be fully covered in a forum post.</s><s> to learn more about how style rules work, take a look at this tutorial i wrote a few years ago: http://www.adobe.com/devnet/dreamweaver/articles/css-selectors-pt1.htm l. it was written for dreamweaver cs5.5, but is still relevant because it concentrates on the css code rather than specific parts of the dreamweaver ui.

<subject>make sure main.css is selected?</subject>
<post author="KevinB9" timestamp="Feb 7, 2014 3:03 PM">
<s>hi.</s><s> when david powers says, "make sure main.css is selected", i laugh a little.</s><s> it's a bit like saying, "make sure your seat belt is fastened" when the plane is about to crash. 
</s><s>what i'm getting at is that it is very confusing for the beginner trying to understand what dreamweaver cc (13.2) is trying to tell you at various times - through selections, bold vs regular, and linethrough.</s><s> i have not seen this covered at all in the literature.</s><s> i'm hoping you can help me. 
</s><s>let's take a very simple test case.</s><s> i set up a blank web page with layout:none and an external style sheet called "teststyle.css".</s><s> then i inserted a small div with id "container" and gave it a few simple properties.</s><s> like this: 

</s><s>it has a background color and i set the margins to "auto" so it shows up at the top middle of my page.</s><s> fine.</s><s> 
</s><s>now, if i click below the container, in the blank body area, in design view, the css designer goes blank and the "teststyle.css" shows as regular type.</s><s> i understand that this is because i have clicked in an area of the document window that has not been styled.</s><s> then if i click inside the container div, the "teststyle.css" goes bold and the rules appear in the properties pane.</s><s> again, fine. 
</s><s>but - if i click in an area of the body next to and outside the container div i also get the bold teststyle.css 
first question - why is this?</s><s> what is the difference between clicking below the container and next to it - on the left or the right? 
</s><s>my second (and last) question has to do with the linethrough.</s><s> in the above scenario when i click in the container div i get a line through the properties: width, height, auto, background color.</s><s> what is dreamweaver trying to tell me?</s><s> why do i get a linethrough insome situations and not in others? 
</s><s>thanks for your time.

<s>when the style sheet is displayed in bold type in the sources pane of the css designer, it means that the style sheet is active.</s><s> the reason you need to select it to create a new selector is because the selectors pane automatically switches between a computed state and an editing state.</s><s> when you see computed at the top of the selectors pane, it's listing the selectors that apply to whatever is currently selected in the document window. 
</s><s>when you see a property with a strikethrough line, hover your mouse pointer over the property name.</s><s> dreamweaver then displays a tooltip explaining why the property is struck out.</s><s> it's usually because the value of that property is being overridden by another style rule. 
</s><s>the computed list in the selectors pane displays all the style rules that affect the currently selected element in order of priority, with the most important rule at the top.</s><s> for example, if you click inside one of the navigation menu items in the bayside beat case study, computed shows a list of all style rules that affect the navigation button.</s><s> if you select the third selector (a:hover, a:active, a:focus), the color property is struck through.</s><s> hover over that struck-through property, and the tooltip tells you that the color property (#7f3300 - burnt orange) is being overridden by the color property in #mainnav a (#ffffff - white).

<s>hi, david.</s><s> thanks for staying in touch. 
</s><s>yes, i am aware of the main support forum but most of that discussion is over my head. 
a big part of my problem is that i was relying too heavily on the official adobe training workbook.</s><s> i find that the book is as much of a hindrance as a help, although i know the authors meant well.</s><s> the "greenstart" dummy website featured in the book is much too fussy - your bayside beat would have been more helpful for the beginner. 
</s><s>to give you an example about the shortcomings of the book - the early descriptions of descendancy and specificity do not include the css designer which contributed to my difficulties later on when i had to create my own selectors within css designer. 
</s><s>also, i tried to float an image inside a div of my first site which caused the div to collapse.</s><s> finally i read on page 300 of the elizabeth castro book about "overflow:hidden".</s><s> that set me back a couple of weeks.</s><s> later i saw one of your earlier tutorials which mentioned something about that, but it was a tutorial for dreamweaver cs5.5 if i remember correctly.</s><s> that brings up another question for the beginner - should you look at tutorials for the older versions of dreamweaver?

Ê although dreamweaver seems as though it can save me a substantial amount of time... Ê i can't f'n use it.Ê it's so frustrating to have the ability to code then purchase a cms that allows the integration of other premiere artisan development tools, only to find my self wasting time when i should be able to speed up my production time.Ê any help is most appreciated.

<s>glad you enjoyed the tutorial. 
</s><s>yes, it's possible to add another text box on a different part of the picture.</s><s> just nest another element inside the #hero div, give it an id, and create similar style rules for it. 
#secondbox { position: absolute; top: 100px; left : 20px; } 
</s><s>because the #hero div has its position property set to relative, absolutely positioned elements nested inside will calculate their offsets from the edges of the #hero div. 
</s><s>it's important to understand that this happens only when the absolutely positioned element is nested inside a relatively positioned one.</s><s> without the relatively positioned outer element, absolute positioning is calculated from the edges of the page.</s><s> because you have no way of knowing how wide the user's browser window will be, using absolute positioning on its own results in the positioned element appearing to move.</s><s> in fact, it doesn't move.</s><s> it remains absolutely positioned in relation to the edges of the page.

<s>you can make an image 100% of the browser width by removing the width and height attributes from the <img> tag, and giving the image a class that sets the width property to 100%. 
</s><s>in the html: 
</s><s><div><img src="images/morro1.jpg" alt="morro rock" class="wideimg"/></div> 
</s><s>in the style sheet: 
.wideimg { width: 100% } 
</s><s>the image will fill the full width of its parent element (in this case, a div).</s><s> if the parent element is the full width of the browser window, the image will be too.</s><s> the problem with this is that the image could become badly blurred on a large screen. 
</s><s>another way of making a image fill the width of the browser window is to use a background image, and set the background-size css property to cover. 
#mydiv { background-image: url(images/morro1.jpg); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size: cover; } 
</s><s>again, the problem is that the image might become blurred if it's not big enough.</s><s> the other issue is that background images don't control the height of the element they're applied to.</s><s> if there's only a small amount of content in the div, the background image will cover the full width, but it won't expand the height of the div.</s><s> you could apply a min-height value to the div, but you have no way of knowing (without using javascript) how wide the browser window will be.</s><s> one other consideration: background-size is not supported by internet explorer 8 and earlier. 
</s><s>as for the screenshot, i don't know how it was created.</s><s> when i was commissioned to create the video tutorial, i created the text, images, and design for the bayside beat case study.</s><s> adobe decided it wanted some changes, so another designer sent me a composite of the revised design, which is what i created in the tutorial.</s><s> i suspect that the screenshot of the sky extending behind the title and navigation bar was probably one of the ideas the other designer was experimenting with, and it somehow ended up in the tutorial web page.</s><s> i quite like the effect of the sky going behind the title and navigation bar.</s><s> the problem is that it won't work on other pages. 
</s><s>from the technical viewpoint, if the image is in the html, you would position the navigation menu over it using the same technique as in the bonus video.

<s>david, i greatly appreciate the effort you are putting in to help computer dummies like me.

</s><s>what i'm getting at is that adove should spend more time on grammar and vocabulary with exercises independent of a finish website. 
a case in point is the official dreamweaver cc classroom in a book from adobe which gvies only a few excercies in chapter 3 (nothing on "float" or "clear", for example) and then suddenly in chapter 4 the book says, "start sketching your website on the back of a napkin!" what?</s><s> the reader is not ready for that.</s><s> what the reader needs is lessons on how to position elements on the page reliably without everything flying apart.
