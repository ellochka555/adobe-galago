<s>so, im brand new to catalyst,(and builder). and the design class i have this semester would have me make something interactive using either catalyst or builder.</s><s> im thinking i can stick with catalyst for my project but that is part of the questions.</s><s> question 1: is catalyst capable of what i need for my project or is builder my better bet.</s><s> question 2: i would ask if what im trying to do is possible for a little advice on how to accomplish it would be nice.(as ive realized finding tutorials for my needs has prooved unsuccessful.</s><s>) Ê Ê so here what the project is and what it needs.</s><s> im making an interactive map sorta like google maps. Ê it will have certain elements: Ê maps: -illustrated terrain map [can do in photoshop] -a road map with seperate layers for roads, trails, city symbols and capitol symbols.</s><s> [will be done in illustrator and and will overlay the terrain map] -detail bubbles: kinda like a popup that will appear with information about a location if you were to hover over or click on a city symbol [either done with buttons, or states] Ê legend: -an interactive legend that can be toggled on or off. which will have options to toggle visibiliy certain layers of the road map (toggle visibility of roads or symbols independently) [dont with several page states.</s><s>] ok all of the above im pretty sure catalyst can accomplish, i just mention this to give a full overview.</s><s> the next part is where im going to have difficulty. Ê navigation: -a diamond shaped four directional pan control hud. basicly 4 buttons for up,down,left, right. used to pan around the map(im thinking ill set them up like the arrow buttons of a horizontal and vertical scroll bar?</s><s> but idont know if it will be functional without a thumb or track?</s><s>) -a zoom slider.</s><s> a simple horzontal slider that will zoom the image in and out.</s><s> ive found a tutorial for a zoom button using a zoom and unzoomed page state but im looking for more control over the amount zoomed. also if this is not possible would it be possible to have multiple zoomed states and have them linked to certain positions on the zoom slider, to kinda mimic the effect im trying to get. Ê finally when panning or zooming i need all the map elements( terrainmap, road maps, location symbols, detail bubbles) to move in unison, while the other elements(the legend and the navigation controls) to remain stationary like a hud for the map. Ê so how about it?</s><s> some one wanna point me in the right direction? Ê edit: i have asked my iinstructor, but when it came to the navigation feature he seemed unsure about it and the method he reccomended was to make different page states for the map and distribute the map into quadrants that would be swapped between using the buttons... thats just way to many page states that will have to all have there own buttons that go to the correct quadrant, and thats a head ache cause my map is 40x40 inch and the frame for the app im making is 800x600 pixel

<s>yes i know this and so does the instructor. which is also why its proven hard to find much tutorial style or learning info. the best i have is the lynda tutorials which doesnt really cover what im trying to do. 
i think the only reason they are still teaching it is because of doloris(spelling?</s><s>) a new adobe program of some sort. idk a whole lot about it. 
ive been trying to look into flex because of the extreme scarcity of catalyst support. and even got the flex trial to play with it at home, but im by no means a developer and its too far outside the designer realm(especially with no design view in it which i learned they removed) it would take me more then a semester to attempt to learn the codeing enough to accomplish what i need. 
if you or anyone knows of a free source code which has the functions i need i could use that and probably attempt to backward engineer it to modify it to my needs. but to make it from scratch i will not be able to accomplish in the time i have.

</s><s>when editing an action sequence, if you select a component on the canvas that has more than 1 state, you can add the "set component state" action to it.</s><s> unfortunately, this will not let you edit a state of a component outside of the current component.</s><s> as a workaround to this, you could create a short 1 second video clip in something like premier or after effects, and import it into your flash catalyst project.</s><s> you can then trigger its playback from within the action sequence.</s><s> (it doesn't need to appear on your canvas, you can just keep it hidden somewhere, and trigger it when the time is right).

<s>another idea that might work, if you just wanted to adjust overall scale would be to simply embed your swf in a div with a hidden overflow.

function resizediv() { var swfdiv = document.getelementbyid("myswf"); if (swfdiv) // check to see if div exists, in case this is called before document finishes loading { var height = window.innerheight; var width = window.innerwidth; var ratio = math.min(height/1200, width/1600); height = 1200*ratio; width = 1600*ratio;

<subject>State transition via button shows in Preview mode, but not when in Run mode?</subject>
<post author="eemaus5" timestamp="Sep 4, 2012 12:01 PM">
<s>i am new to flash catalyst (using 5.5) but have picked it up fairly well over the last week.</s><s> i am working using an existing project, and i am to add to the project in the format that has already been determined.</s><s> that being said, i have really only learned what i needed to in order to complete the tasks given to me.</s><s> so far, i have not had any problems aside from "on click" transitions from one state to another. 
i created a button and then added an interaction in which "on click" of the button, there would be a .</s><s>75s fade out to another state in the project.</s><s> there are already "on click" button transitions of this exact type in the project, and from what i can tell the interaction settings and smooth transition settings of the new button i created seem to match to those of the existing. 
</s><s>here's the thing: the transition works properly when clicking the preview button in timeline, but it is when clicking file > run project that the transition no longer seems to work.</s><s> instead of the .</s><s>75s fade out that is shown in the preview, the transition is a stark and immediate switch to the next state.</s><s> so the actual transition from one state to the other is correct, just not aesthetically correct, as there is no fade. 
i have tried copying and pasting an existing and working button with a correctly functioning transition from an exisisting state to the new one, but when i change the text of the copied button, it is linked to the existing button whose text also changes.</s><s> this is even when the previous button was unselected and only the new state was selected. 
</s><s>what could be preventing the transition from happening properly in run mode when it appears to be working correctly in preview?</s><s> is this a glitch of some sort or am i missing a step/some information?</s><s> of all of the new things i've learned to do in catalyst, this seems to be the easiest one, yet for some reason the hardest to execute. 
</s><s>my apologies for being so long winded, this is just driving me nuts, and at the risk of wasting time, i wanted to provide as much info as possible. 


</s><s>update: problem solved 
</s><s>in case anyone was suffering a similar problem, the solution is simple: select your desired state transition (state 1 > state 3) in the "timelines" panel.</s><s> then select the button being used to incite the transition by clicking on it in the area where your state is being previewed.</s><s> then click "smooth transition".</s><s> simple enough, and the transition should now run when in run mode.

no matter what i try, no matter what file i use, i always get this error when i try to export a library package: "parent of resource: /[filename]_tmp is marked read-only." 
where [filename] is the name of the fxp file i'm trying to export from. 
i have also tried repairing permissions on my mac, as well running catalyst as super-user, but no luck. 

some other error details that might be relevant: - cs5 is fully updated. - the files used have been: built from scratch or imported from psd - nothing is recorded in the console when the error occurs - the mac is running os x 10.6.4 - the error dialog pops up after the save dialog appears, and after a filename is entered.

making a custom preloader requires some technical diving.</s><s> here are two great resources for how to do this between flash professional and flash builder: http://www.alagad.com/blog/post.cfm/custom-preloaders-for-flex http://gotoandlearn.com/play?id=108 
the basic workflow would be this: 1.</s><s> create your project in catalyst, save it as an fxp and import it into flash builder 2.</s><s> create your preloader animation in flash professional and export it as a swc 3.</s><s> bring the swc into your project in flash builder 4.</s><s> create an actionscript class that links the swc to flex loading events 5.</s><s> attach the as class to your main application 
for now, there is unfortunately no way to do this without some coding and some work between multiple flash products.

<s>if you want to create an image gallery using data lists, check out this thread: http://forums.adobe.com/message/2649963 which covers the topic in detail. 
</s><s>creating a custom preloader, as i mentioned above, requires non-trivial work in builder.</s><s> if you want to replace the loader with a custom static image, then you should be able to customize the resources here: http://www.psyked.co.uk/adobe/flex/custom-preloader-class-for-flex.htm or here http://onflash.org/ted/2006/07/flex-2-preloaders-swf-png-gif-examples. php 
if you want to use any type of flash file for your preloader, you will have to work in flash authoring (flash cs4).</s><s> catalyst projects rely on the flex framework, which is not available during the preloader phase.</s><s> this means that you cannot use a catalyst-generated .swf as a preloader.</s><s> to load and play a simple .swf animation, you can adapt the code at the above link.</s><s> to create a preloader that changes based on the loading status / percentage, you will need to do significantly more coding, and you can follow the steps at the below tutorials. http://www.alagad.com/blog/post.cfm/custom-preloaders-for-flex http://gotoandlearn.com/play?id=108 http://www.jessewarden.com/2007/.../making-a-cooler-preloader-in-flex- part-1-of-3.html (temporarily down due to a site hack, but you can use google's cached version) (or try a web search for "flex custom preloaders")

<s>nicely done.</s><s> everything works as i would expect when i visit a flash website. 
</s><s>did you notice that when you go to the gallery and click on a an image's thumbnail - and then leave the gallery by clicking a link to a different page on the site - and then go back to the gallery - the image is still the same one you last clicked on, rather than resetting to the first image?

<s>i too, have the same concerns regarding adobe catalyst which i've become comfortable with.</s><s> however, go to adobe labs and read about adobe edge (in beta).</s><s> you're allowed to download it for free and experiment... like myself, you just might be pleasantly surprised.</s><s> to me, it seems that adobe is replacing any new flash-based apps with apps that are html5-based... yes, no?</s><s> anyway, there's also another app in adobe labs that you can download called adobe muse... pretty cool interactivity minus motion.</s><s> would love to see edge and muse merged into a single app.

<s>there is also another solution called "hype". http://tumultco.com/hype/ <- cheap or wakanda which can be found here: http://www.wakanda.org/features/studio <--free 
muse + edge (with multiple scenes/states) + the ability to add custom code would be nice. 
</s><s>but the subscription pricing model of muse is a abolut no-go 
but muse + edge do not let you so easily create webpages with dynamic content as it is possible with catalyst + flash builder. 
</s><s>creating javascript widgets is less fun that creating skins with catalyst and implement the logic in fb
