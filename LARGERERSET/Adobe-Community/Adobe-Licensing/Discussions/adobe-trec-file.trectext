<s>i am having the same problem, but i described it differently in a post i did this morning, so here is what i said: 
i purchased an upgrade from photoshop cs 4 to photoshop cs 6 directly from adobe in december of 2012.</s><s> (my version of cs4 was originally purchased by me as part of a cs4 web premium suite.</s><s>) 
</s><s>my cs4 version has worked since 2009 with no licensing issues. 
i did not install the upgradeto cs6 immediately, i just installed it in august of this year, but i do not think that the problem stems from my delay in installation. 
</s><s>what happens is that every 6-8 times that i open the program, i get a screen asking me to "license creative cloud", which i do not want. 
</s><s>the only options i am given are: join now, license this product, or continue trial. 
</s><s>if i simply x out of the screen, photoshop cs6 will not open at all. 
</s><s>if i click: license this product, i get a sign-in screen that asks for my serial number, which i fill in and then my program opens. 
i have tried customer support 3 times - one chat and 2 phone calls (all lasting at least 1 hour each time) and i am not getting the correct help to solve this issue. 
i am extremely frustrated and outraged that i am bothered by this stupid issue.

<s>believe it or not, i just got a phone call from adobe! 
i got onto their website yesterday and "reported a bug".</s><s> i also wrote a long complaint when i received an email with my case number.</s><s> if you can long in and find your case number, i suggest that you also write a complaint or see if you can re-open the case if they have closed it.</s><s> also, report the issue as a bug. 
</s><s>anyway, the woman who called me (obviously from india, but quite good) said that this is a "known issue"!</s><s> can you believe it?</s><s> i can't even express how angry this makes me!</s><s>!</s><s> 
</s><s>so she had me uninstall photoshop cs6, but then we had to go to a number of different areas to delete other files.</s><s> it was quite complicated, so i don't recommend that you do this yourself unless they offer the step-by-step process that you can first print out. 
</s><s>she explained that the reason we had to take all of these steps was that some program files (not photo files) were corrupted.</s><s> after we spent about 10 minutes or so deleting everything as she directed, she then had me download and run a "creative cloud cleaner" from adobe's website and run that. 
</s><s>next, we reinstalled cs6.to my horror, the program opened in exactly the same way!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s> but, then we put the serial number in, opened the program, and went to the updater to downloaded the latest version which is 13.0.(whatever), which took another 1/2 hour. 
</s><s>then, the program opened normally.</s><s> she is sending me an email in case the issue pops up again.

<s>this is (per adobe web site) the same price you'd pay to upgrade win cs4 to win cs5; adobe allows a platform switch along with the upgrade, no extra charge.</s><s> as to why an upgrade from old master to current design premium is more expensive than from old design premium ... it's adobe's pricing policy. 
i can speculate as to adobe's business ressons for the policies, but it's only speculation: 
i suspect that, in part, they are concened that some users will upgrade version, downgrade package, and discover that many/most features from the old install / expensive version will still work even though not "included" in the new / less-expensive version.</s><s> you (and i, of course) are honest and would be careful not to exploit this, but the world has a noticeable population of villains. 
</s><s>as to why they don't support switching from win cs4 to mac cs4, i can think of several reasons, but in the end they come to not wanting to maintain stock (web or physical) or to extend ther support burden for prior versions.

<s>technically speaking, there should never be any harm in performing a manual deactivation of an adobe product, because it will free up a slot your two allowed systems that can be reactivated at any time (on the same computer or another). 
</s><s>having a cloned version is fine but that won't have a computer to run and activate on until you restore that image to some machine. 
</s><s>if the hardware or o/s is different after an upgrade, then adobe may sense that as a "new" activation and thus run you out of your count.

<s>ordinarily, each adobe product can be used by one primary user on up to two computers, although not at the same time... 
</s><s>if you need more users, you can just purchase an adobe volume license (also called a "business" license) for as many seats as you require. 
</s><s>so in your case victor, 10 users would probably qualify you for a volume discount there. 
</s><s>and typically with business licenses you can "downgrade" the software to an older release if you need to, although it goes only one major version back...</s><s> so cs2 would be too far back now - but cs4 would be okay.
