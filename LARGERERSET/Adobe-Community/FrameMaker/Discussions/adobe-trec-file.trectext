<s>if you are using fm on windows but don't have framescript, you could use autohotkey, which is a very versatile, macro interpreter for windows under gnu license (i.e. free to use). Ê in contrast to what a framescript could presumably do, autohotkey won't recognize whether the cursor is within a table or not, but as the fm key sequence is unambigious, that doesn't do any harm. Ê your ahk macro could look like this: #ifwinactive ahk_class framefamily7.0mdiframe down::sendinput {esc}tmd{down} up::sendinput {esc}tmu{up} #ifwinactive the first line is specific to fm8 (although it says "framefamily7") and restricts the hotkeys to apply only in fm.

<s>hi lynne.</s><s> i found your reply as i was looking for a solution to this problem (keyboard navigation up and down rows in tables) in framemaker 10 and was wondering if you/anyone knew of an updated solution if you were now using framemaker 10. 
</s><s>for example, in fm 10, i'm assuming the file to update now is cmds.cfg because i couldn't fine customui.cfg (e.g., it's now under c:\program files (x86)\adobe\adobeframemaker10\fminit\configui)?

<s>c, a few things: 
1. fm does not provide a file called customui.cfg.</s><s> if you need it, just create it with your favorite text editor.</s><s> it can go in ...\fminit\configui.</s><s> alternatively, you can create the file elsewhere and/or name it something else.</s><s> just find the line in maker.ini that says:

</s><s>remember that there are two copies of maker.ini--one in the fm installation directory and one in your user area (such as \users\<your userid>\appdata\roaming\adobe\framemaker\10). 
2.</s><s> the ability to specify a custom config ui file is provided specifically so you do not need to edit cmds.cfg. 
3.</s><s> if you want to inspect cmds.cfg, there's an easy way to make it more readable, even if the contents are still somewhat obtuse.</s><s> there are various conventions for representing line breaks on different computer systems and the cmds.cfg convention is different than the most common windows convention.</s><s> just open the file in fm, which recognizes the line breaks correctly. 
4.</s><s> starting with fm 11, each workspace has its own menus.</s><s> while maker.ini can still specify a customui.cfg, it's not very useful.</s><s> fm does process any such file when it starts up, but as soon as you open a document all the menus and shortcuts are replaced by those specified in the .cfg file associated with the current workspace.

<s>hello, i've installed framemaker 12 on a surface pro (windows 8, tablet-sized monitor).</s><s> when the preferences are set to framemaker 12 basic, the interface is displayed as it should, using the complete screen.</s><s> but if i switch to a different flavor: framemaker 12 xml authoring, or framemaker 12 structured, the interface shrinks to about half the screen making it utterly unusable as i can't see anything.</s><s> i've set the monitor to default.</s><s> this "shrinking" also occurs when i'm in the basic framemaker 12 mode and press the shortcut of f9 to get the list of paragraph styles. 
</s><s>is there a way to control this undesired behavior and have the gui use the entire screen?

</s><s>jpgs are only meant to be used for photographic images (not any form of screen captures).</s><s> so unless you are actually dealing with photos, disregard this format (it will introduce unwanted artifacts, especially around text and straight lines). 
</s><s>if by word 10 you actually mean word 2010, then the graphics can be direcly obtained from the file.</s><s> the word .docx format is just a zip container.</s><s> so simply crate a copy of the file with a .zip extension and use any zip program to open this..</s><s> you will find the graphics in their original state and can adjust them as required, rather than relying on microsoft's filtering. 
</s><s>in the mif file, look for the "<colorcatalog" entry, which is the start of the color catalog.</s><s> then there will bee a series of < color entries, each looking something like this: 
<color <colortag 'black'> <colorcyan 0.000000> <colormagenta 0.000000> <coloryellow 0.000000> <colorblack 100.000000> <colorattribute colorisblack> <colorattribute colorisreserved> > # end of color 
the first 16 colors (ending at "salmon") are system reserved colours and should be left as is.</s><s> the subsequent rgbxxxxx color tag entries can all be deleted. 
</s><s>be careful not to delete the closing ">" for the "<colorcatalog" entry after the last "<color" entry.

<s>just something to think about...

</s><s>we do this for several reasons, some of which might not apply to other users: 
we're on fm7.1, and since no one seems to know exactly when and how adobe does unicode conversion when migrating a document to fm8 or later, this isolates any problems to the variable catalog.</s><s> this is not just future planning.</s><s> our outside translators, usually on later frame, probably find it helpful already.</s><s> when you use keyboard shortcuts, you often have to apply a character format (font name and/or style).</s><s> the next character you type after that is by default also in that override.</s><s> using a variable automatically resumes the current formatting.</s><s> the appearance of all instances of the char is controlled from one place.</s><s> so if, for example, you can no longer use the inherently superscripted 0123 (usually because you need 4), it's easy to change all the current ones to explicity supers.

<s>when you convert a legacy fm document to fm 8 or later, the conversion is pretty smart.</s><s> fm will look at the font used for every character (either stylesheet of hardcoded), and the character map used by that font, and will convert that character to the correct unicode character. 
i used it to convert some multi-lingual masters (english, russian, and chinese mixed, along with dingbat and symbol) and it converted all document text perfectly, although i had to hardcode the double-byte chinese text into a chinese font because the main stylesheet font could only handle english and russian.</s><s> it was impressive, and a real time-saver for a 60-manual set.</s><s> another remarkable thing is that i could still use the old (non-unicode font) if i wanted, within the limitations of that font of course.</s><s> in my case, fm8 could still display the converted russian text correctly using the old non-unicode font!</s><s> fm will backmap the unicode document characters (which are stored in unicode and stay as unicode) on-the-fly and use the old font to display the characters correctly using the old font.</s><s> it was very useful and it gave me workable documents for the interim, until i could set up stylesheets that used the new proper unicode fonts that came with fm 8. 
</s><s>however, no conversion is performed on features with "internal" text that has no inherent font format such as cross-reference formats, variables or markers, which is probably just as well because remapping the cross-ref marker text would break the links).</s><s> you'll have to convert or rebuild those by hand. 
i have some related questions.</s><s> using \x code to make special characters that you can pick off a menu only works for the "traditional" character slots at position 256 (ff hex) or below.</s><s> is there any syntax that works for unicode slot numbers that are higher than 256?</s><s> i have tried \u and \u followed by the four-digit utf-8 code but i get nothing.

<s>what i experienced recently (independent of the printer driver software , on both nt4 (with the kernel mode printing system) and xp (with the user mode running stuff)) is that, whenever using truetype fonts which are downloaded incrementally, it happens that the initial part of the font program (the part containig the type42 interpreter) is downloaded more than once, which causes the set of glyphs of the previously loaded instances get undefined (i.e. replaced by .notdef) and thus appearing as white space.</s><s> i suspect that this is an issue of the windows gdi, as i never encountered this bug with applacations which generate their own postscript code, like indesign.</s><s> helge

<s>derek, 
</s><s>thanks for replying.</s><s> the thread you mentioned was one of the many i tried, but none of the suggestions worked.</s><s> it seems the only solution you found was to install a very old driver, is that correct?</s><s> i don't want to do that when every other program on my pc, adobe or not, can print perfectly fast to the default, uncustomized adobe pdf printer. 
</s><s>that points the blame at framemaker, or perhaps using linked illustrator files within framemaker.</s><s> the reason i say this is because when printing, the little framemaker print output window clearly shows the process is slowing on the graphics-heavy pages.</s><s> i'd expect that a bit with any program, but should sending a single page with a little 1.2 mb linked ai file really lock up a 3.0ghz pc for 25 seconds? 
</s><s>some further tests are necessary.</s><s> i'll have to waste some time taking one chapter from my book and replacing all the linked ai files with linked svgs to see if the problem is illustrator based.</s><s> if that doesn't work, i'll try tifs or jpgs... 
</s><s>edit: since writing the above i have tried using a cs3 illustrator file, an svg and a tiff.</s><s> the cs3 file and the svg still took 20 seconds to print a single page, but using a tiff instead caused the page to print almost instantaneously!</s><s> how can it be that using a vector based file can cause printing to adobe pdf to be about 20x slower than using a tif file? 
</s><s>edit: using framemaker's save as pdf... menu option to write the complete book takes around 4m 30s, an improvement over the 7 minutes printing it to the adobe pdf printer, but still far too slow.

<s>from your reply it isn't completely clear if you are you importing native .</s><s>ai format files or files saved in eps format. 
</s><s>files in the current native .</s><s>ai format use a pdf-like structure (that contains a lot more info than a pdf required for display), which fm assumes is a pdf file.</s><s> when creating output, fm then tries to run this "pdf" format through it's internal filter to create an eps representation, which takes additional time trying to sort out the illustrator internal information from the pdf drawing information.</s><s> the epslevelforplacedpdf setting in the maker.ini file determines how the features are converted.</s><s> by default this is set to the dumbest level (i.e. ancient level 1 postscript). 
</s><s>eps files are just simply dumped straight into the output stream (passed through). 
</s><s>on a fast machine, the resource hit from this sort of conversation may not be too noticeable for the occasional file, but with many .</s><s>ai files, this could be more noticeable, though i doubt it's solely the cause of the larger times that you're seeing.</s><s> usually, if you have a properly configured adobepdf printer instance set as your system default for fm, work on local drives, use eps, tiff, jpeg, png imported by reference, print to file to create .</s><s>ps files, the process is very quick.</s><s> all i can think of is to use a tool like process explorer to monitor what is happening when creating output from fm to try to identify where the slow down is occurring.

</s><s>yes, but did you also uninstall and reinstall acrobat 8?</s><s> since you had both, you can't just uninstall the one you don't need.</s><s> my understanding is that acrobat and reader each can overwrite files of the other.</s><s> so uninstalling reader may still leave messed up files or missing files for acrobat.</s><s> you have to uninstall both, reboot, then reinstall acrobat.

<s>arnis, 
</s><s>many thanks for clarifying the situation with ai and framemaker.</s><s> in conclusion, for other users coming to this thread: 
* importing a native .</s><s>ai file into framemaker (using "import by reference" in my case) doesn't work as it should. * framemaker doesn't interpret the .</s><s>ai file correctly as simple vector artwork, but instead as pdf, and so makes very slow work of converting the graphic when printing. * outputting from illustrator as .</s><s>eps instead of .</s><s>ai should be much quicker when imported into framemaker, but not necessarily.</s><s> other unresolved issues might also cause slow printing. 
i do hope a future update patch to fm10 will cure this flaw in framemaker's interpretation of ai files.</s><s> personally, i am not remotely interested in fm10's 'rich media', but would love it if framemaker could properly handle 'lean media', such a vector drawings made in illustrator.
