<post author="JJRosenfield" timestamp="Dec 5, 2013 9:07 AM">
<s>thank you for writing back, sg. 
i currently use creative cloud and have used all versions of photoshop since 2 was released.</s><s> i am a daily user with time spent in the program ranging from 6-12 hours.</s><s> i'm a professional retoucher and rely on the program to be dependable. 
</s><s>my mac is top of the line, approximately 3 months old, with all software up to date. 
</s><s>specific issues i have experienced are: general crashes, healing tool program crashes, healing tool freezes and delays that are minutes long (without program crash), folder group mask program crashes. 
</s><s>the lowest photoshop moment i have had thus far involved version 6, but not through creative cloud.</s><s> it did not result from a crash.</s><s> i finished my work for the day, and on re-opening files later, all data in my retouching layer was deleted on several files for a project.</s><s> the layer itself was visible on reopen, but contained no pixels.</s><s> that was shocking because i save files every few minutes.</s><s> i've never seen anything like it before. 
</s><s>another strange problem: sometimes command + z stops working.</s><s> after a program restart it works again. 
i have asked colleagues if they have similar issues лл they do.</s><s> (with the exception of data from layers being deleted.</s><s>) 
</s><s>i don't understand all the bugs and glitches, and some of these issues feel virus-like.</s><s> photoshop 5 was a perfect program лл 3 was pretty great, too.</s><s> all these bells and whistles adobe adds, are they causing other problems?

<subject>Edge 3 animations and compositions not working on Android v4.0 to v4.2</subject>
<post author="Padua" timestamp="Mar 2, 2014 9:49 PM">
<s>i am developing an android app using webview (using phonegap/cordova v2.8.1 ) .</s><s> i used adobe edge 3 and generated few animations using svg images and couple of html pages 
query #1: scaling of image is continously increasing with every orientation change 
on nexus 5, nexus 7 and nexus 4 (all with android version v4.4.2) the adobe edge animations work as expected in my app, however there is one issue when configchanges option in android manifest file is set to "orientation|screensize" used in the main activity of my app to allow it to automatically resize this screen/images when screen orientations between portrait and landscape.</s><s> this works but image size keeps increasing (never reset to original size) every time change the orientation of my android device from portrait to landscape and vice versa. 
</s><s>is there any issue with adobe edge based animations w.r.t to automatically resizing based changes to screen orientation on android ? 
</s><s>query #2: images(i.e. symbols) are incorrectly loaded/shown and sometime stage itself is not loaded 
on samsung tab 2 (v4.1.1) and samsung s3 (v4.2.1), the same android app runs fine, however some images are not loaded randomly, sometimes the image is blank and sometimes incorrect symbols are overlayed onto the stage1 and stage 2 screens. 
</s><s>has body faced similar issues while using adobe edge generated animations with webview/phonegap based android applications ?</s><s> if yes how it was fixed ? 
</s><s>this android app uses only the two html pages (as stage 1 and 2) and then it loads different symbols (i.e svg images) using hide and show , load composition methods to create animations. 
</s><s>let me know if there are any adobe edge 3 related issues specific to different version of android ...in particular android v4.0, v4.1 and v4.2 ..because the same app works fine on android v4.3 and v4.4 
i suspect it is due to differences and support available in webview implementations in different versions of android. 
</s><s>any help on this is greatly appreciated ! 
thanks

<subject>Black screen with sound on every Youtube video</subject>
<post author="REGIFISHY" timestamp="Jan 23, 2014 10:30 PM">
<s>i posted this on the official youtube forums three days back, but seeing as how nobody knows about them and that it's probably either flash or chrome acting up, i'll re-post it with some additional information here. 
</s><s>basically, every time i try to watch a video, regardless of which channel it's coming from, the video always fails to load.</s><s> not just the video, though, but the entire gui!</s><s> the only thing that appears is a black void accompanied by the audio of the video or an ad. 

i do have adblock plus installed and was lead to believe that since the video ads are seeping through (ab+ normally blocks those.</s><s>) that it was a problem with that instead of flash.</s><s> uninstalling it did absolutely nothing. 

</s><s>since that didn't work, i tried uninstalling flash.</s><s> again, no progress.</s><s> likewise with clearing the history and cache of chrome, running an antivirus scan, and using ccleaner to remove unwanted files. 

i have no idea which program is causing this or how to go about fixing it, if it's a problem with my computer and not the website itself, that is. 

</s><s>any ideas?</s><s> 
</s><s>in addition to this, i have also checked tried firefox and while the ads are blocked, and the gui appears, it lags excessively. 
i ran a disk defragmenter followed by an antivirus/spyware scan in safe-mode (yes, i did try and see if that would remedy the problem in chrome.</s><s> while the gui loaded and the video played ad-free, it would only do so for about 2 to 3 seconds before greying out and saying "an error has ocurred." i didn't try firefox.</s><s>) after re-ccleaning my hard drive.</s><s> still nothing. 

</s><s>another interesting tidbt is that right-clicking and selecting "inspect element" will display the video as it should be, but only until either the video is fullscreened, or the text window is closed.</s><s> after that all subsequent attempts will display the text window, but will fail to restore the video.</s><s> (boy, i sure love those comma things, don't i?</s><s>) 
</s><s>i'm not sure if the problem is with flash, chrome, both, or neither but it still irritates me either way. 
(apologies for the mess of a post, hopefully somebody can read it.</s><s>)

<subject>Media queries stopped working with update 1.0.390.1</subject>
<post author="joeyblowie123" timestamp="May 4, 2013 2:39 PM">
<s>correction: media queries are working (including multiple media query blocks in a single css file).</s><s> what has stopped working is the ability to use weinre to inspect the current rules applied to an element, on the mobile device.</s><s> weinre reports only those rules that are applied outside of the media query, even though the ux displays according to the rule inside the media query. 
i know definitively that i was previously able to see the rules as overridden by the media query, and adjust those on the fly.</s><s> i don't know what changed, or where, and i have tried previous versions of my source where this was working. 
</s><s>i've reinstalled ei, the chrome extension, and have tested with both the default and a local weinre server. 
</s><s>i'm stumped... any suggestion or ideas are welcomed!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s> 


</s><s>i updated cs6 dreamweaver today to resolve a crashing bug... which it didn't. 
</s><s>while updating, edge inspect was updated as well. since the update, media queries fail in the weinre interface.</s><s> i have read the known issues about multiple media query blocks in a single css file, which i was doing and it was working just fine for me.</s><s> now...</s><s> nada.</s><s> the queries do not execute.</s><s> i tried moving the css into separate files and loading them conditionally, but both files now get loaded, and the latter always get the priority.

<s>"edge inspect" recently took over shadow, and i'm noticing some bigtime problems.</s><s> i develop locally using mamp, and then use shadow to view progress and target different screens.</s><s> recently while developing with wordpress, i'm using template tags to dynamically point to the theme's stylesheet.</s><s> on my local machine, it points to "localhost/wp-content/themes/~", and on my production server it automatically points to the theme dir on that machine.</s><s> but i've noticed that shadow is basically useless for this now, as it tries to point to "localhost" on the ipad, iphone, etc, and obvi doesn't find files there.</s><s> when it was called shadow, it just worked when i pointed my browser at a site, but now i can't use the software to develop locally.</s><s> am i missing something here, or do i have to reconfigure all my uris and template calls if i want to use inspect?</s><s> i'm finding myself doing it the old way, pushing to staging and then using the browser on the ipad.

<s>mbswartz, this has always been an issue with shadow and now edge inspect.</s><s> we currently translate only the url of the main page and not urls referenced within the page.</s><s> therefore, if your source references css, js, etc. using absolute urls containing 'localhost' edge inspect is not able to locate the content correctly for the reasons you noted.</s><s> this is most common in local wordpress installations where it is configured as 'localhost.' the current workaround is to either use relative urls or, if that's not possible, modify the wordpress configuration to use the ip address instead of localhost.

<s>hi wondim, it looks like you're asking about a number of different issues here, i'll try to address them all... 
</s><s>for edge inspect to be able to browse your wampserver on localhost, you need to make sure that wampserver is online and that there is no firewall software blocking incoming connections.</s><s> those are the two most common issues we see with this workflow.</s><s> can the native browser on your device reach the localhost site?</s><s> if you're seeing slow synchronized browsing, check your wireless connection signal strength.</s><s> if the signal strength is low, that can slow everything down.</s><s> do what you can to increase that strength and you should see some improvement.</s><s> fyi, edge inspect has little control over how quickly your device can access and retrieve the pages you're trying to test.</s><s> if you're seeing slowness loading pages, it's very likely you'd see the same issue with the native browser.</s><s> we've never claimed miraculous results from using edge inspect.</s><s> it's a simple tool that can help simplify the mobile develepment workflow, especially with multiple devices connected.</s><s> it offers a few nice features in addition to synchronized browsing.</s><s> it's true that for some webpages you will need to log in on each device separately, but that's because we can't transfer the session information from your computer to your devices.</s><s> if the page supports use of credentials in the url for login (e.g. https://gooduser:secretpassword@www.example.com/webcallback?foo=bar ), then you should be able to enter that into your computer and the devices should log in using those credentials.
