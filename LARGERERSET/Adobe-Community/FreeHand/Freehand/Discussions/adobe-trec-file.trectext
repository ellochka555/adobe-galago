<s>the red squares are text overflow boxes in adobe applications, which use a different text engine than freehand. 
</s><s>you can avoid the overflow boxes by using a modern adobe application to generate the pdf. 
</s><s>method 1: from freehand, print to a postscript file.</s><s> use acrobat pro/distiller to distill the file into a pdf.</s><s> this will keep the exact positioning of text as set in freehand, but the text is no longer in contiguous blocks and easily editable. 
</s><s>method 2: open the fh file in illustrator cs4 or later.</s><s> adjust the size of the text boxes.</s><s> save as pdf.</s><s> there will be some line spacing changes and text reflow with this method.

<s>quote: originally posted by: d.m.gold curt, it was due to the merger that they were laid off. so i would think adobe didn't need these people in their new merged company. see john nosal weblog statement below december 07, 2005 -------------- it depends on how you define "they." john's note doesn't refer to anyone else but himself.</s><s> perhaps the whole fh programming team wasn't laid off, but they certainly weren't working on fh.</s><s> i also remember a post by someone in the dallas area that saw the mm office remove its sign well before the adobe buyout.</s><s> this was around the fh10 ugliness.</s><s> and about the time john was most active and obviously fighting for fh, but never too optimistic.</s><s> my guess is that he (alone) was kept on before the buyout, then after the purchase, some beancounter in adobe made more cuts.</s><s> probably because the suits bought mm without much consideration of fh, and then when it was theirs, they finally got around to considering its fate.</s><s> at that point, it was a c/b analysis.</s><s> so again, cs3's planning probably was started before cs2's release.</s><s> then worked on well before mm's purchase.</s><s> now that cs3 is about to be released, it will be time to think strategically about what adobe can do with it's vector apps aka. cs4.</s><s> look at the timeline from cs to cs2 to cs3; expect the same timeframe for cs3 to cs4.</s><s> that makes it about 2009 before you see fh's influence on any meaningful level.</s><s> but it ain't gonna happen unless we as a community make an effort to be realistic in our feedback.

<s>greetings and thanks to everyone who's posted to this thread.</s><s> interesting insights and opinions here.</s><s> special thanks to those of you who sent private messages of condolence and support via my site.</s><s> i took a few days off and i'm feeling a little better.</s><s> i stopped in here off and on and decided to wade in again with what will probably be another longwinded epic-style post.</s><s> i tend toward verbosity, especially with a subject like this.</s><s> in addition to raising my blood pressure a notch or two, the subject of freehand's demise sparks some passion in me.</s><s> this will be a long post because i want to attempt clarity.</s><s> clarity sometimes takes time.</s><s> navale's post regarding the fact that adobe charges full price for a broken freehand is spot on, as is darrel's car metaphor.</s><s> if gm sold a car, and the engine exploded when a buyer first turned the key, well, that would be the lead story on the evening news.</s><s> congress would launch an investigation.</s><s> i think there's a federal law somewhere that requires carmakers to make parts available for 10 years after a car is released to the public.</s><s> i could be wrong, but i think that's true.</s><s> anyway, there's no parallel in the software world...</s><s> no protection for consumers.</s><s> it's buyer beware and blame the consumer if things don't work as advertised.</s><s> while the speed of software development makes a ten year 'parts' guarantee impractical, i don't think some sort of mandated guarantee of maybe 3 years is unreasonable.</s><s> i appreciate judy arndt's post.</s><s> "keep in mind that if adobe is going to put it's logo on a freehand box, the product is going to have to live up to adobe standards." well said, judy.</s><s> as for the eps, pdf, opentype, and "old code" issues, well, i could discuss that at greater length later.</s><s> the short version is that there are workarounds which worked prior to mac osx 10.4.</s><s> adobe's freehand product page states that freehand is compatible with mac osx 10.4.</s><s> i took that statement to be true, without following the "emerging issues" link.</s><s> stupid me.</s><s> i took adobe at it's word without reading the fine money grubbing print.</s><s> adobe has a major pr problem with freehand and chooses to blow it off.</s><s> frankly, this astonishes me.</s><s> maybe adobe thinks we'll just fade away.</s><s> maybe adobe is correct in that assumption.</s><s> for better or worse, adobe now owns freehand.</s><s> freehand is a spectacular vector drawing tool (and i still contend that it runs circles around illustrator -- old code and all -- don't even get me started about illustrator's lumpy old legacy code).</s><s> there's a market for freehand and no more competition (thank you ftc; nice to know you're watching out for consumers -- not).</s><s> i know no figures on the number of people who use (and maybe even love) freehand, but i suspect it's easily in the hundreds of thousands... maybe even millions.</s><s> why would adobe abandon a product it now owns and shun a substantial market?</s><s> maybe it's just corporate spite?</s><s> the trouble is, we just don't know.</s><s> adobe is silent.</s><s> there's a major communication break between adobe and freehand users.</s><s> i want somebody at adobe to tell us the truth... either adobe will support and develop freehand or ignore and therefore kill it.</s><s> i want to read a letter on adobe's freehand web page from somebody in a position to tell me what the hell is going on with a product in which i've invested thousands of dollars and thousands of files...</s><s> a product i still want to buy.</s><s> quick note to doentz here: yeah, i loved fontographer too.</s><s> call me paranoid if you like, but i sometimes think fontographer was way too brilliant to be allowed to exist in a market-driven world where adobe owns just about every font and there's no room for people to freely make and distribute their own creations.</s><s> from adobe's point of view, such freedom is way too dangerous.</s><s> capitalism run amok.</s><s> curtcarto's post was interesting.</s><s> yes, software development always takes time.</s><s> i know this; i've seen it first hand... and maybe that's what's going on with adobe freehand.</s><s> the point is, we don't know!</s><s> all indications from adobe don't look good.</s><s> adobe is silent.</s><s> adobe still charges full price for a broken freehand, but doesn't list it in its main products page (you have to dig to the "view all products" link).</s><s> if an updated version of freehand will indeed join adobe's product line - with full support and commitment - you'd never know it by cruising through adobe's corporate site.</s><s> r.i.p.</s><s> freehand.</s><s> argh.</s><s> i'm gonna stop typing pretty soon.</s><s> i'm tired and sad.</s><s> before i go, i want to post a little more background about my life with freehand.</s><s> maybe this will help readers understand why i'm so passionate about freehand.</s><s> i became aware of freehand way back around 1986 - shortly after aldus pagemaker launched a revolutionary concept called "desktop publishing." prior to that, i made art the old fashioned way... you know, i threw paint at a canvas or scribbled stuff on real live paper with pen and ink and oil pastels.</s><s> i beta-tested fhv.7 for some of the guys who wrote the original freehand code.</s><s> i bought freehand v1.0 and later used v2.0 at a design firm that employed me to make illustrations for their clients.</s><s> with freehand v3.1, aldus nailed the interface and features.</s><s> it was a stunning and elegant piece of work.</s><s> it made illustrator look like the junky copycat it is to this very day.</s><s> if adobe offered a mac osx compatible version of freehand 3.1, i'd buy it in two seconds flat.</s><s> adobe could market it as "freehand lite" - heh.</s><s> and then things started getting ugly and convoluted.</s><s> illustrator was emerging as a serious competitor in the vector art world, while aldus was loosing track of everything that made it great.</s><s> too many cooks in the kitchen... it happens all the time.</s><s> the dot com bubble started to pop and nobody gave a flying fart about art and vision or related nonsense.</s><s> it was all about money.</s><s> i beta-tested freehand 4.0 (which was code named "roadrunner" at the time).</s><s> it was a wreck...</s><s> a screaming, flaming car crash.</s><s> it pulled the rug out from under every user who had invested time and money and trust in freehand.</s><s> i told the development team that if it was released as written, loyal customers would scream bloody murder, jump ship and buy illustrator.</s><s> i said, "if your intention is to kill freehand, release this version immediately." by this time, aldus was dead.</s><s> macromedia owned freehand and released it as freehand 5.0.</s><s> loyal freehand customers screamed bloody murder, jumped ship and bought illustrator.</s><s> freehand's market share (not to mention its art and vision) was a sad memory.</s><s> macromedia dorked around with freehand for a decade or so.</s><s> version 5 was pretty dismal, but almost useable.</s><s> by version 7, it was almost ok.</s><s> by versions 9 and 10, it was almost interesting.</s><s> through all these versions, macromedia didn't fix the stuff that didn't work in previous versions... they just tacked on new "features" nobody wanted and nobody used.</s><s> illustrator followed the same development path, but by this time it was too late for freehand.</s><s> illustrator ruled.</s><s> a buddy of mine just sent me an email.</s><s> his message punched through... one of two legitimate emails and 56 spams.</s><s> he said: "maybe its time to start associating adobe with microsoft in software's "evil overlord" category." argh.</s><s> welcome to the future.</s><s> adobe launches a new marketing tool called "adobe youth voices" on its home page.</s><s> socially conscious work that can only be expressed by kids who buy adobe products.</s><s> it's all so sick.

<s>ok, i speak for myself then.</s><s> my experience is similar to yours, started with mac ii and fh 1.0 twenty years ago.</s><s> i also had illustrator for a while, but found it like walking in wet cement compared to freehand.</s><s> i can agree that osx is not what i wanted except for the stability.</s><s> but since it causes my old fh7 files to crash in fhmx, the combination is a disaster.</s><s> so i continue to work with fh7 in classic mode and even if it is a little slow, i doubt that anyone working on illustrator in windows can keep the same pace.</s><s> and as i have said here before, when working with mx in osx, it takes me ten times longer to get the same result...</s><s> i may be very oldfashioned, but what i can achieve with fh7 is more than enough for all of my present and future needs.</s><s> more bells and whistles like in mx might satisfy other people but is very annoying to me.</s><s> compares to mobile phones that has 2 cameras, games, mp3, radio and tv. - i just need a telephone in mine....

<s>quote: is a four-year pause in a new-release schedule hard evidence that a piece of software has been abandoned?</s><s> if windows users can wait five years for the upgrade to vista, then i'm willing to wait for an upgrade to freehand mx which was released in 2003.</s><s> judy, i agree with what you said here.</s><s> four years may be a long time, but it's not unheard of in this industry.</s><s> i still hold on to the theory that adobe will concentrate on the other programs, like freehand, once the cs3 release is out of the way. quote: my suspicion is that illustrator's "code base" is probably more "old world" than fh's--i know its interface is.</s><s> i also liked what jetlt said about freehand's code.</s><s> i am so glad someone spoke up about this.</s><s> it seems to me (and i have no programming experience as well) that freehand's code must be fairly clean.</s><s> for example, macromedia had no problems converting freehand's interface when adobe won the lawsuit against them.</s><s> if the code was such a mess, wouldn't this have been a difficult challenge?
