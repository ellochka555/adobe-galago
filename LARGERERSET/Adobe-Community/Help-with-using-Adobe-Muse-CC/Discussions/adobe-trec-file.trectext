<subject>Can't get TypeKit fonts to work in Adobe Muse!</subject>
<post author="drasik" timestamp="Mar 21, 2014 2:54 AM">
<s>hi there! 
</s><s>just wondering if anybody new how to get purchased fonts from typekit to work as html in adobe muse? 
i have tried following the link below but when i go to publish my site the text is still all images.</s><s> problem is i know nothing about code but this seemed pretty straight forward to follow but don't seem to be getting any luck with it. 
i was trying to use the font 'museo sans rounded' and i was told to try maybe other fonts which i did and also they did not work, but if i just take a font from within the adobe muse/typekit 'web fonts' then this works. 
</s><s>please could someone explain to me if i'm doing something wrong or if there is a better way of acheiving this? 
</s><s>many thanks darren

<s>hi darren, 
</s><s>the muse insider workflow you are using requires you to use a web-safe or a supported web font in muse design mode.</s><s> if you use a system font, muse will export it as an image. 
</s><s>that you can't see the typekit web font until you preview or publish is the main shortcoming of the muse insider workflow.

<subject>Different key positions for multiple scroll effects (motion, opacity and slideshow)</subject>
<post author="LeMartz" timestamp="Mar 21, 2014 7:22 PM">
<s>hi, 
</s><s>is it not possible to set different keypositions for the motion and opacity scroll effects.</s><s> when ever i try to change one of them the other get automaticly change to the last edited key position. 

what i am trying to achieve is: 
object starts at 100% opacity position x-200px object moves towards and reaches keyposition x objects starts to fade out at keyposition x+200px obejct reaches 0% opacity at x+300 
i really miss a 4th key position for opacity as i often need a sequence of 0%-100%, 100%-100%, 100%-0% - it feels silly having to dublicate the object in order to achieve this. 
</s><s>the other problem i am having is while using a scoll effect triggered slideshow(autoplay), i cant seem to be able to add motion scolleffects as well.

<post author="Sanjit_Das" timestamp="Mar 21, 2014 10:53 PM">
<s>hi martin 
</s><s>with scroll effects and opacity , you setup the opacity to change with scroll which would be the initial , browser edge and final position.</s><s> so the object would have a opacity change effect on initial show up, while movement on page which depends upon the browser edge position and then the final position.</s><s> i understand the purpose you are trying to achieve , but at current stage we don't have a middle scroll position or vertical one where you can setup scroll speed and effects separately. 
</s><s>regarding slideshow autoplay to get triggered with scroll motion, you would need to setup that like slideshow moves up on the page and autoplay is configured to start after few second which we would assume sufficient to scroll up the page , that would be the workaround because there is no direct way we can setup the scroll with autoplay trigger.

<s>sorry for the slow reply.</s><s> thank you for sending your file.</s><s> (i was on vacation for a few days.</s><s>) 
</s><s>at ~1.5gb and 978 pages, yours is the largest .muse file i've seen to date. 
</s><s>muse is currently not a great tool for the site you're creating.</s><s> the shear size of your site is beyond what muse can work with in a single .muse file. 
</s><s>your site is best suited to a content management system where a small set of template pages are married with a database of items, products, or in your case, animal species.</s><s> unfortunately, i'm not aware of any content management systems that provide a no coding wysiwyg solution to website creation.</s><s> i'm confident muse will eventually grow to enable database-drive website creation without coding, but we're not there yet. 
</s><s>if using a cms and a developer and/or coding a site is not an option, then you could get to the end result i think you're looking for with the current muse, but it will be labor intensive to create and maintain. 
</s><s>the basic idea would be to view your website as a set of smaller microsites (all hosted under the same domain name yourbiz.com).</s><s> each microsite would be uploaded to a separate directory/folder on your hosting.</s><s> perhaps there would be a folder (and thus a .muse file) for birds-a-d and another for birds-e-h, etc. you would manually create url hyperlinks to link from a top-level microsite with the home page and major category navigation pages to specific pages within the microsites.</s><s> and manually create url links from the microsites back to the top-level microsite. 
</s><s>strictly speaking there is no specific page count, image count or other complexity limit within muse.</s><s> but as the total size and complexity of a .muse file increases, the performance of muse will degrade.</s><s> targeting a page count of 50-100 pages per .muse file (assuming low to moderate complexity per page, as you currently have) should provide reasonable performance and room for growth in each .muse file. 
</s><s>we're actively working on major changes that will eliminate some of the memory constraints muse currently has and enable us to take alternative approaches to improving performance of large sites.</s><s> but it will be some time before the fruits of our labors result in muse being the best tool for creating and maintaining a website like yours.

<subject>WHY does Muse upload every page when I only change one thing. And how can I make Muse faster.</subject>
<post author="DrKoob" timestamp="Mar 21, 2014 12:32 PM">
<s>i have a bunch of sites i do for people that are similar.</s><s> here's one: www.mattfelis.com. 
</s><s>when i make a single change on one page, just a text change (the last time i deleted a freakin' period) and tell muse to upload it to ftp host, it uploads every single page in the site.</s><s> every one.</s><s> and since there are 55 pages, that means it takes about 20 minutes with a darned fast upload speed (20mbps upload).</s><s> it isn't the uploading that kills me, it's the exporting of pages.</s><s> all of them.</s><s> all 55.</s><s> why is it doing this? 
</s><s>and while we are talking about speed, most of the time in working with these files i see what i call the beach ball of death on a constant basis.</s><s> just opening a page from plan mode or going back to plan mode from a page can take 20 seconds.</s><s> i know, i've counted.</s><s> copy and paste between pages can take longer.</s><s> i am running a 3 year old mac pro with 12 gigs of ram and tons of disk space.</s><s> how can i make muse work better.</s><s> more ram?</s><s> to speed it up i find that i have to quit about every 30 minutes and restart muse to get it back to any semblance of speed.</s><s> smaller sites obviously don't do this but big ones (i have a lot of those) do.

<s>i have a problem.</s><s> i am using feautered news widget as a sliding panel for some info far left of my website.</s><s> and i have 2 triggers: 1 with info and 1 empty if someone wants to make info dissapear (in case of overlaping).</s><s> but i want that info to show only on homepage, so i set that other empty pannel as active on another pages, but now when i click info to be shown it comes from right instead of left!</s><s> its becuase the widget is made so that the starting triggered panel is always far on the left!</s><s> and thats stupid...:/ 
you can see my problem if you go to the site im making: http://stapla1.businesscatalyst.com/index.html and go to any other page than homepage, for example: go to "o plastici" and then try triggering "vreme i kontakt" on the far left of the page...it comes from right instead of left like it does on home page.</s><s> why the objects cant be ordered independently and instead they are binned by the starting triggers. 
</s><s>is there a workaround of this problem?</s><s> i tried everything i could think of, so for now i just set transition on "fade" for other pages. http://stapla.businesscatalyst.com/

<subject>New features in Adobe Muse 2.0</subject>
<post author="Corey@Adobe" timestamp="Nov 15, 2013 3:37 PM">
<s>the following is a list of features now available in adobe muse: 
align palette we've added a new align palette, available from the window menu, or by clicking on the new 'align' control in the control strip.</s><s> you can use the new align features to align or distribute selected objects relative to each other, or to the page content area (which is the area from the bottom of the header to the top of the footer). 
</s><s>asset upload you can now link to any external file (i.e.</s><s> pdf, .zip file, .dmg or .exe) and add a hyperlink to it to enable users to download the file from your web site.</s><s> all linked assets will be uploaded / exported along with the rest of the adobe muse site, in a new 'assets' folder. 
</s><s>code generation improvements we've improved the html code generation for adobe muse 2.0 in several areas.</s><s> shadows, glows, and gradients now use css instead of generating additional images.</s><s> we've eliminated many cases where we generated duplicated html nodes.</s><s> we've also changed our javascript framework for our widgets from spry to a smaller, faster framework called webpro.</s><s> these changes make the export process faster, and adobe muse now generates less images and smaller html files.</s><s> shadows and outer glows are represented using css box-shadows instead of rasterizing.</s><s> fixed the naming of images exported by adobe muse which have been either resampled or cropped before exporting.</s><s> background images that have been set to "scale to fit" or "scale to fill" are now exported with the 'contain' or 'cover' background-size css property, respectively.</s><s> browsers display a warning when you serve a page that mixes http and https content, which can be triggered if loading content from a content delivery network (cdn) such as amazon's cloudfront.</s><s> to avoid these warnings, adobe muse uses some javascript to not use cdn urls with https in favor of falling back to a local version of the content. 
</s><s>forms we've added a new form widget to the widget library.</s><s> you can easily configure the form to send the form submissions to multiple email addresses, and optionally redirect users to another page after submitting the form.</s><s> you can add and remove fields, and style the form as you would other adobe muse elements.</s><s> you can independently style the various states of the form, and form fields to provide a compelling user experience, with visual cues for error states, empty states, and more.</s><s> because form processing requires server-side support, adobe muse forms are configured to work when published to adobe business catalyst.</s><s> if you make changes to your form and publish again, adobe muse will make the appropriate changes to your adobe business catalyst forms.</s><s> adobe muse will safeguard data when redesigning your adobe business catalyst forms if a field with no data submitted is removed, it will be deleted from the database.</s><s> if a field that has submitted data is removed, it will be preserved in the database, but can be deleted from the adobe business catalyst admin console if desired.</s><s> font improvements the font ui includes font previews in the form of sample text rendered in the corresponding font/weight/style.</s><s> submenus for the various font types (web, web-safe and system) have been eliminated in favor of a single sectioned list, with shortcuts to scroll to each section.</s><s> web fonts and system fonts are grouped by font family; individual weights and styles (e.g.</s><s> bold, italic, bold italic etc.</s><s>) of multi-face font families appear in sub-menus.</s><s> the font ui displays an automatically generated list of recently used fonts.</s><s> the number of recently used fonts to display can be configured and list can be cleared.</s><s> the font list can be filtered by font family (e.g.</s><s> "myriad pro"), weight or style (e.g.</s><s> "bold italic"), a combination of these (e.g., "myriad pro bold italic"), including partial names in any order (e.g., "it bold myr pro").</s><s> adobe muse now uses platform-independent references to fonts, so adobe muse documents can be exchanged between mac and windows without failure to resolve font references.</s><s> adobe muse displays localized font names (if available) based on the application locale, rather than system locale.</s><s> adobe muse documents can be exchanged between across application locales without failure to resolve font references. 
</s><s>ftp upload adobe muse now includes the ability to ftp to the host of your choice by selecting file > upload to ftp host in the adobe muse menu.</s><s> adobe muse's ftp upload dialog allows you to specify the host, subdirectory, and login information. 
</s><s>adobe edge integration if you publish an .oam file from adobe edge, you can place it into adobe muse.</s><s> all required images, css and javascript content will be uploaded at publish or export time.</s><s> as with other placed content any changes made in the source adobe edge file and re-saved in .oam format will be detected within adobe muse, and you can use the assets palette to update the content in adobe muse. 
</s><s>language support japanese and italian localizations have been added.</s><s> specific japanese features include the addition of japanese web safe fonts on the font menu as well as support for japanese ime, including text input and double-byte text. 
</s><s>ruler guides adobe muse now includes the ability to drag guides onto a page from the horizontal or vertical ruler.</s><s> page items snap to guides when moving, but guides are not exported.</s><s> adobe muse supports selecting multiple guides on a page. 
</s><s>sitemap.xml adobe muse now creates a sitemap.xml file for better search engine optimization when the site is hosted somewhere other than adobe business catalyst.</s><s> you can exclude a page from the sitemap.xml file (if you don't want search engines to find it) by setting an option in the page properties dialog. 
</s><s>browser fill improvements you can now set a gradient on the browser fill.</s><s> (note: opacity, focal point and size are not available due to cross-browser compatibility and usability standards) in addition, you can now set your browser background image to fit or to fill. 
</s><s>control strip improvements the adobe muse control strip now has collapsible control sets (similar to illustrator).</s><s> as you expand the width of the adobe muse application window more controls appear.</s><s> additional controls have been added to the control strip Ð states, transform, and align.</s><s> text controls are now available when text frames are selected, not just when you're using the text tool. 
</s><s>drag and drop styles/swatches/colors you can now drag and drop a paragraph style or character style onto a text frame to apply the style to the text.</s><s> you can also drag a graphic style into a page item, or the page to apply it.</s><s> you can drag a swatch onto a page item, page, or browser area of a page to apply background fill.</s><s> you can drag a color (via dragging the color preview area just above the rgb edit boxes) onto a page item, page, or browser area of a page to apply background fill.</s><s> you can also drag a color to the swatches palette to create a swatch of it. 
</s><s>hyperlinks the hyperlink control can now be resized so that users can see entire url.</s><s> we've changed the label of the hyperlink option "title" to "tooltip" to help clarify where user enters the hyperlink destination information.</s><s> new selection visuals hint labels now show when you hover over elements on the page.</s><s> there is a new preference to turn this display off.</s><s> groups and widgets are now indicated with dotted line containment rectangles.</s><s> when a page item cannot be resized in a specific direction we now show an "x" instead of a missing handle. 
</s><s>widget improvements slideshow and composition widgets now include a numeric stepper for controlling the auto play speed in seconds rather than off, slow, medium, fast.</s><s> we've added shuffle as an option to the slideshow and composition widgets so the slideshow or composition contents play in random order.</s><s> changing a menu widget from horizontal to vertical, or vice versa, now does a much better job of preserving size and spacing.</s><s> changing the state of one part of a widget at design time now changes appropriate sibling parts to the same state to more closely mimic browser behavior.</s><s> based upon customer feedback, we renamed the following: "fit width" and "fit height" to "uniform spacing" "uniform width" and "uniform height" to "uniform size" other assorted improvements shift + return/enter will create a soft return instead of a carriage return.</s><s> control/ctrl + tab activates next tab.</s><s> control/ctrl + shift + tab activates previous tab.</s><s> option/alt + click a page tab will close all open page tabs.</s><s> option/alt + click a site tab will close all open sites.</s><s> holding the shift key down while resizing an image allows you to perform a non-proportional resize.</s><s> the x, y, w, h, and angle edit boxes support duplicating and transforming the selection if you hold down the option/alt key when you hit return/enter or tab.</s><s> if you enter a value in an edit box you can do a shift + enter to apply the value and keep focus in the edit box.</s><s> select same feature added which selects other objects on the page that are the same type as the object currently selected and can be used through alt control shift a and the context and edit menus.</s><s> added feedback to rotation tracker so you see the angle next to the cursor as you rotate.</s><s> changed rotation display values to be between -180 and 180 to match other adobe apps.</s><s> previously it was 0 to 360.</s><s> publish dialog has a new faq link to help users understand the implications of publishing.</s><s> upload to ftp and export to html workflows now have a 'domain name' input field.</s><s> this is used for generation of sitemap.xml and for enabling typekit web fonts.</s><s> the display of 100% width items on ios devices is now enabled.</s><s> adobe muse now produces functional submenus on ios devices.

<s>me too, i totally agree.</s><s> adobe could generate serverside code (php) according to the form-structure and put it into the export folder of the website.</s><s> i would say an additional check-box ( generate serverside code ) would do the job.</s><s> depending on checked or not, muse generates the code for you.</s><s> the webdesigner is responsable for installing that code on the customers server.</s><s> i understand, that adobe want to sell their service, but i have a lot of customers, that have their own provider and don't like to move to another. 
btw: i thank the muse team for their improvements and i think it's a good thing to have a default option for the forms with business catalyst, but what speaks against distributing the generated code for catalyst to the user to implement the server-side code on the customers server?

<s>hi 
</s><s>this is not really a fix but what we did at things & ink.

<s>hi there. Ê so the solution for this requires two things.</s><s> well actually you could do it in your os's build in explorer and the text editor of choise, but that would take ages to complete. Ê so how do we quicken up the process, and what do i actually want you to do here.</s><s> well... Ê .html files can be converted into .php files with no loose whatsoever.</s><s> the reason it breaks a site created in adobe muse is because the code generated by muse refers to .html files and not .php files.</s><s> so you need to rename all your .html files to .php and you need to do the exact same within your documents. Ê what you'll need is: a program that can rename multible file at once, and another to find and replace within multible files i used these adobe bride dreamweaver Ê here is a guide for you to convert your site adobe muse site into a fully functional php site. Ê +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +ÊÊÊÊ remember to backup your websiteÊ + +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Ê first we rename the file extentions... Ê 1.</s><s> open adobe bridge.</s><s> 1. within bridge navigate and select all the folders and files that was created when you exported your muse website as html.</s><s> 2. now go to tools>batch rename.</s><s> 3. in the window that opens find new filenames.</s><s> 4. set option one to string substitution and option two to original filename.</s><s> 5. in the find: test field enter .html and in the replace with: text field enter .php make sure 'replace all' is cheched. Ê now all your html files has been converted into fully functional php files, that could be integrated into wordpress.</s><s> but your site is currently broken, cause all the links on your website still looks for html files. Ê to get around this you'll need a program that can find and replace on multible files.</s><s> i used adobe dreamweaver.</s><s> and this is how it's done in dreamweaver. Ê 1.</s><s> open dreamweaver.</s><s> 2. edit > find and replace...</s><s> 3. in the window change find in: to folder...</s><s> 4. select the folder where your muse website is stored.</s><s> 5. in the find: field enter .html in the replace: field enter .php 6. press replace all. Ê all done.</s><s> your website is now a fully functional php site, that can run php code.</s><s> you will now be able to integrate wordpress into your website.</s><s> see: http://codex.wordpress.org/integrating_wordpress_with_your_website Ê jacob

<s>additional tip on this process - if you have headers and footers that are the same across multiple pages, you can create header-common.php and footer-common.php files which will speed up your work process in wordpress.</s><s> make sure you tag the "get_header( )" and "get_footer( )" function calls correctly for each page-[name].php, or wordpress will just call its fallback "header.php" or "footer.php".</s><s> be sure to check that all your scripts for any given page are in the correct places (which is why i like to create individual headers and footers).

<s>muse does not implement "responsive layout" as defined by a hand coder (which means using one html file and one set of images for multiple layout variations that are driven from multiple css definitions usually triggered by media queries). 
</s><s>however, muse does provide a few features for creating a web page design that responds to some degree to resizing of the browser window: 1) browser fill images set to scale to fill or scale to fit (generally with the page fill and stroke set to none, so the browser fill is the background everywhere) 2) 100% browser width objects (which can contain background images set to scale to fill, scale to fit, center, etc. and which can include text frames) 3) pinned items, which maintain a specific location offset from one or two edges of the browser window 
you may want to look through the sites at the muse site-of-the-day to get a feel for the spectrum of webpage designs muse is capable of.

<s>i 100% agree with eugenezubov.</s><s> the adaptive solution to mobile was not a direction for muse.(the team just wanted to give us a temporary solution to ease the request-tensions and the negative publicity it will give muse) in a tablet version, the contents of a desktop version of a site would often be maintained on that medium, and that will be hell of a work to redo!</s><s> i'm working on a site now and am finding it difficult delivering on schedule.</s><s> it's just like doing the site all over again. 

</s><s>nevertheless, muse future is bright, if the muse team can place priority into muse-bc 'marriage', then non-bc features later.</s><s> i believe that will help in finding a better workflow and arriving at a perfect solution (bc already supports responsive design/unlimited list templates, etc )

<s>dj, first, technically speaking the lastest version of muse is "responsive".</s><s> you can create three different layouts for desktop, tablet and cell phone.</s><s> it does not implement this support in the industry best practices, but i don't know of any plans in the works to offer anything further than this.</s><s> but as we have discussed above muse is not the tool for a web developer.</s><s> it is a tool for individuals to build microsites or vanity sites.</s><s> simple, small sites for specific purposes. 
</s><s>if you are truly building many sites and want then truly responsive, muse isn't the product you want.</s><s> you should use dreamweaver or something else.</s><s> i like specific features and functions in muse, but i can't use it for most of my work because i can't read/edit the code it makes.</s><s> it was not intended for that purpose.</s><s> it's good for what it does.</s><s> my toolbox has many tools in it.</s><s> not one of those tools does every job i need to do.</s><s> but i use each one for its best purpose.</s><s> when a product tries to do everything, it usually doesn't do any of them very well.</s><s> i'm sure muse will get more and more functionality, but i doubt if it will ever replace dreamweaver and dreamweaver will probably never be able to do all the things muse does.</s><s> i'll keep them both in my toolbox.
