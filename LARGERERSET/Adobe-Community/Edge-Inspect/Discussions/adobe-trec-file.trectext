<s>hi ryan, 
</s><s>i checked with my boss and he says we have only one wifi router, so he thinks it shouldn't be a subnet issue.

</s><s>if i originally established the connection at home (the first time i tried to connect -- which i think may have been while working from home), would the chrome extension remember settings that would keep me from being able to connect when both devices are moved to another wifi network (i.e., office)?</s><s> i wonder this because i think i also had trouble connecting when i was at my friend's house on his wifi network.

<subject>Edge Inspect Won't Display Typekit Fonts over Local IP</subject>
<post author="dgaebel@madebymode.com" timestamp="Jan 28, 2014 2:49 PM">
<s>liz Ê jan 28, 2014Ê |Ê 05:17pm est hi dennis, Ê here is the information from one of our engineers on using edge inspect and typekit: Ê "unfortunately it seems you've run into a situation where edge inspect and typekit don't integrate very well.</s><s> i'll explain a bit more, then offer some suggestions to work around the issue. Ê when you're browsing a local website via the hostname 'localhost', which would not be accessible to any other devices on your network, edge inspect automatically gets your machine's local ip address (which is not the same as the external ip as shown on sites like whatismyip.com) and sends that to the mobile apps.</s><s> for instance, let's say i have a sinatra application running in chrome on my mac as http://localhost:4567.</s><s> my iphone wouldn't be able to understand the hostname "localhost", but it can see my mac using its ip address 10.1.10.1, so edge inspect will navigate to http://10.1.10.1:4567. Ê so, to get fonts working, you could add both 'localhost' and '10.1.10.1' to your kit.</s><s> however, we don't recommend adding local ips to kits because they tend to change without warning.</s><s> (in my example above, the next time i turn on my computer its ip could have changed to 10.1.10.2, but all i would know is that fonts had stopped working on my devices again.</s><s>) Ê to work around this, we recommend using some form of "dynamic dns" - basically, a domain name that is automatically updated with your current ip and therefore will always point to your computer. Ê if you're using a mac, the simplest thing would be to use your mac's bonjour hostname.</s><s> bonjour is a technology built into mac os x and ios to help devices find each other automatically over networks. Ê to find your bonjour hostname: Ê 1.</s><s> open system preferences on your mac.</s><s> 2. choose the sharing icon.</s><s> 3. your bonjour hostname will be displayed in the top area, under the "computer name" field. Ê you can add the hostname that appears there to your kit, and use it on any apple device on your network.</s><s> for example, my bonjour name is my-mbp.local, so i can browse to http://my-mbp.local:4567 on any mac or ios device and see my sinatra app. Ê unfortunately, this simple solution will only work on apple devices or windows pcs with apple's bonjour software installed - you can't use this hostname with android phones or tablets.</s><s> if you need a hostname that will work on any device, there are a couple of options i'd recommend: Ê 1.</s><s> a third-party service called forward offers a way to easily forward ports from your computer to other devices anywhere on the internet.</s><s> you can learn more about them and sign up for a 30-day trial here: https://forwardhq.com.</s><s> forward will give you a permanent domain name for your forwarded app that you can add to your kit, such as 'dev-yourcompany.fwd.wf'. Ê 2.</s><s> 37signals has a free "wildcard dns" service called xip.io that will automatically forward traffic to a local ip address.</s><s> you can get your current local ip address by opening system preferences, then choosing network.</s><s> the ip address should be shown in the small text underneath the connection status for whatever connection is active (i.e. has a green dot next to it).</s><s> once you have the ip, you can access your computer at [your ip].xip.io.</s><s> to get fonts working, add *.xip.io to your kit.</s><s> remember that your ip may change, so if your site stops being accessible you should check to make sure you have the correct ip address. Ê i personally use xip.io if i need to test typekit on multiple devices using edge inspect.</s><s> it's certainly not the easiest option to use, but it works quite well with almost no setup and it's free. Ê we're going to work to make the experience using typekit and edge inspect together better in the future, but hopefully these suggestions will help you out for now." Ê i hope that this helps; let me know if you have any other questions on this! -- liz Ê dennis Ê jan 28, 2014Ê |Ê 04:25pm est original message Ê howdy, Êlooking for some suggestions to setup edge inspect correctly so i'm able to see my fonts served from typekit. Ê Êmy current setup is the following w/mamp pro http://cl.ly/image/0w2h1e1q2p2t (http://cl.ly/image/0w2h1e1q2p2t) Ê Ê it's a lithium based project setup so i need to operate this way in order to view the site locally.</s><s> changing the server name to something custom like mysite.local does not seem to work so far with edge inspect nor does localhost (especially since mamp screams at me). Ê currently, if i add my local ip to the typekit kit settings my fonts still won't load on edge inspect. Ê thanks for the assistance, Ê ~dennis

<s>edge inspect doesn't do anything different to read the website off your computer than a normal browser does.</s><s> we send a url to the connected devices and expect them to be able to load that address into the webview/uiwebview components in the edge inspect app on the devices.the reason you're seeing an issue with edge inspect and your http://foobar.dev site is the same reason why you wouldn't/shouldn't expect to type that url into a browser on another machine and be able to view the website... there's no external dns server to talk to that knows where that address is actually located.

# # this is the main apache http server configuration file.</s><s> it contains the # configuration directives that give the server its instructions. # see <url:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2> for detailed information. # in particular, see # <url:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/directives.html> # for a discussion of each configuration directive. # # do not simply read the instructions in here without understanding # what they do.</s><s> they're here only as hints or reminders.</s><s> if you are unsure # consult the online docs.</s><s> you have been warned. # # configuration and logfile names: if the filenames you specify for many # of the server's control files begin with "/" (or "drive:/" for win32), the # server will use that explicit path.</s><s> if the filenames do *not* begin # with "/", the value of serverroot is prepended -- so "logs/foo.log" # with serverroot set to "c:/program files/apache software foundation/apache2.2" will be interpreted by the # server as "c:/program files/apache software foundation/apache2.2/logs/foo.log". # # note: where filenames are specified, you must use forward slashes # instead of backslashes (e.g., "c:/apache" instead of "c:\apache"). # if a drive letter is omitted, the drive on which apache.exe is located # will be used by default.</s><s> it is recommended that you always supply # an explicit drive letter in absolute paths to avoid confusion. 

# # serverroot: the top of the directory tree under which the server's # configuration, error, and log files are kept. # # do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.</s><s> if you point # serverroot at a non-local disk, be sure to point the lockfile directive # at a local disk.</s><s> if you wish to share the same serverroot for multiple # httpd daemons, you will need to change at least lockfile and pidfile. # serverroot "c:/wamp/bin/apache/apache2.2.17" 

# # listen: allows you to bind apache to specific ip addresses and/or # ports, instead of the default.</s><s> see also the <virtualhost> # directive. # # change this to listen on specific ip addresses as shown below to # prevent apache from glomming onto all bound ip addresses. # #listen 12.34.56.78:80 #listen 80 listen 0.0.0.0:80

<subject>WORKAROUND/POSSIBLE SOLUTION: Chrome 30 for Mac and Edge Inspect CC sec-WebSocket-Protocol error</subject>
<post author="ArnoldD" timestamp="Oct 2, 2013 7:19 PM">
<s>i came across this thread (how to solve the sec-websocket-protocol error in chrome 30.0.1599.66 m) and applying the same edit to the inspect.js file for the edge inspect chrome extension solved the websocket error immediately, the issue most of us have been experiencing with the latest chrome version: 30.0.1599.66. we couldn't revert back to chrome 29 (latest known version working with edge inspect) because we couldn't find it, but in any case chrome will auto-update to version 30. 
</s><s>my system info: osx 10.7.5, chrome extension adobe edge inspect cc 1.0.424.1, adobe edge inspect cc 1.0.407, chrome 30.0.1599.66 
</s><s>disclaimer: this steps will modify the adobe chrome extension as installed from the chrome web store.</s><s> i will not be held responsible for any other issues this may cause.</s><s> i'm just reporting a fix that immediately worked for me.</s><s> i'm assuming you can always remove the extension from chrome and reinstall from the store. 
</s><s>step 1: disable edge inspect chrome extension browse to chrome://extensions and uncheck/disable adobe edge inspect cc 1.0.424.1 
</s><s>step 2: browse to the inspect.js file in finder, cmd-shift-g or from the menu bar go > go to folder...</s><s> copy/paste ~/library/application support/google/chrome/default/extensions/ijoeapleklopieoejahbpdnhkjjgddem/1.0.424.1_0/js/ 
</s><s>step 3: edit inspect.js file select inspect.js and edit it any text editor (textedit, textwrangler, or even edge code cc) on line 61 look for the following code: this._wshandle = new websocket(this._protocol + "://" + this._host + ":" + this._port + "/", "shadow"); edit the line to remove , "shadow" (note the comma and space is also to be removed).</s><s> so you're resulting code should be: this._wshandle = new websocket(this._protocol + "://" + this._host + ":" + this._port + "/"); save changes 
step 4: enable edge inspect chrome extension browse to chrome://extensions and check/enable adobe edge inspect cc 1.0.424.1 the icon in your toolbar should change immediately from grayed out to full color brown and everything should function as usual 
again, i'm not sure if this is the ultimate fix, but at least edge inspect works again until the chrome extension is fixed or chrome changes the way websockets are handled. 
</s><s>hope this helps!</s><s>!</s><s>

<s>hi handycam, 
</s><s>first, the client applications can't use file:// urls, make sure to only use the http protocol to access the files you want to preview in edge inspect. 
</s><s>second, yes, you absolutely can use localhost urls served by mamp, wamp, xammp, mac web sharing and the like.</s><s> i'm not sure exactly what's going wrong for you, but here's a few things to look into: make sure to (at least temporarily) turn off any software firewalls you have running to eliminate that as a problem.</s><s> try accessing the local page with a http://localhost url.</s><s> if that doesn't show in edge inspect click the button in the upper right corner of the edge inspect application on your ipad and choose "open in browser".</s><s> what url do you see in safari and is your page displayed correctly there?</s><s> try accessing the local page via http://<your_ip_address> and answer the questions from #2 look into the apache error and access logs in mamp and see if you see any messages relating to those recent failed accesses.</s><s> sometimes you need to modify the apache httpd configuration file so that outside computers can access your page.
