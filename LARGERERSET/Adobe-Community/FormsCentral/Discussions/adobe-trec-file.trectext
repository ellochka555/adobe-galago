<s>hi; 
</s><s>what is happening in the pdf is actually a "feature".</s><s> we had a lot of issues previously with customers not being happy with print out of the downloaded pdf since text boxes that had text input that overflowed the size of the text field would not display all of the text in the printed version. 
</s><s>the change (feature) was to expand all text boxes to fit their content.</s><s> in order to expand the boxes, when the fields are laid out side by side, they have to each be moved to their own row, so if one field overflows each field in that row will get it's own row. 
</s><s>the reason it took me a bit to realize this was as it should be was that i thought we were doing this only for multi-line text fields, but it is done for all user input fields so that the pdf will print all of the data.

<s>hi; 
</s><s>a workflow for form filling where multiple users fill out the form is not something we support - however it can be accomplished using our "save web form" feature, which is what it sounds like you are trying to do.</s><s> see this tutorial on using that feature: http://forums.adobe.com/docs/doc-4135 
</s><s>when you say "but once we opened the form again..." it sounds like you are opening the url to the form from when you were signed in creating the form, and not clicking on the link in the email that you are sent with the saved form to complete...</s><s> there would not be any data in the form after a user does a "save web form", no data is sent to formscentral until a user clicks "submit".</s><s> clicking on the link in the saved form email should retrieve the partially filled form for the next user in the workflow to continue and then either save again and email to the next in the work flow, or submit. 
</s><s>thanks, josh

<post author="Randy Swineford" timestamp="Sep 14, 2012 8:49 AM">
<s>formscentral now allows you to create, distribute and collect data using fillable pdf forms.</s><s> when you distribute your form as a pdf respondents will be able to: fill out and save forms offline, then submit when back online fill out the form little by little over several hours/days, then submit when completed forward the pdf form to other people to fill out different sections of the form then submit when completed keep the filled out pdf form for their records print a copy of the pdf form Ê the new page view mode in the design tab shows how the form will be laid out across pages when saved to pdf.</s><s> you can access the page view mode by selecting it in the lower right corner of the ui: click image to view full size Ê based on the paper size chosen (file menu -> form setup), page view mode will automatically break the fields up into pages.</s><s> click image to view full size Ê you can also define your own custom page breaks within page view by clicking the new page button on the item toolbar.</s><s> click image to view full size Ê page breaks created in the web view do not show up in page view Ð each view has its own independent page breaks.</s><s> this allows you to better optimize your form pagination based on the form type (web vs pdf) Ê once you have setup your form go to the distribute tab to distribute the pdf form.</s><s> click image to view full size Ê save submission-enabled pdf - this will save out a fillable pdf form that contains a submit button at the bottom of the form.</s><s> respondents can fill out the form, click submit and all of their data will appear in the response table. Ê if you want to save out a fillable pdf form that does not contain a submit button (the data will not be collected using formscentral) then go to the file menu and select the save as pdf form menu item.</s><s> you will be asked if you want to collect responses or not using formscentral.</s><s> select "don't collect responses" - this option is focused at users who just want a pdf form that can be sent around in email, filled out and then managed like a document. Ê Ê the fillable pdf forms created using formscentral allow adobe reader users to fill out the form, save the file locally and submit their data.</s><s> your respondents only need reader or acrobat version 8, 9 or x. Ê you can also distribute both a web form and fillable pdf form at the same time - the options are not mutually exclusive.</s><s> all of the submitted data from both will appear in the response table. Ê pdf forms do have a couple of limitations that prevent some of the formscentral features from working with them.</s><s> pdf forms do not support these features (click here for more info): page skip logic question skip logic redirect urls payment processing attachments Ê this feature is part of our basic and plus plans.

<s>hi, 
</s><s>formscentral does not distribute your forms directly - you have to email them yourself, or post the form to a website.</s><s> because of this, there's no customer/contact management feature in formscentral, and therefore no import contacts feature. 
</s><s>your customers do *not* need an adobe account to fill out the form.</s><s> whoever you send the pdf (or html link) to, can fill it out. 
</s><s>unfortunately at this time, we do not offer any kind of signing feature for our forms.

<s>i want to have a pdf but then let the user select options and based on those it will add a transparent image to the pdf for printing, is this possible? 
i have a cd label and they need to change the image and text before printing it, and so i thought i could create all the custom images in png transparent and then if there was a way to allow them to pick and add it to the pdf it would save a lot of time, plus it would be easier to update the background main image.</s><s> otherwise i have to create a separate pdf for each one...

<s>hi randy, is it possible for the same respondent to complete the " same" form a number of times offline.</s><s> in order to submit all responses when they are online again. 
i am using forms on android tabs and ipads , submitting through 3g connections. the signal in the area is really bad and it is difficult to complete a survey without this facility.

<s>hi avis; 
</s><s>if you are using the "formscentral" desktop application included with acrobat pro xi then you will need to sign into formscentral in order to save a pdf with the formscentral submit button.</s><s> in addition to being signed in the form needs to be "online", you can move the form online from the "collect responses online" tab when you open the form. 
</s><s>what is the question "also suggest..."?</s><s> i think you are asking how to add another type of submit button, not one that submits to formscentral, if that is correct you can check out this youtube video on creating an email submit button: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jql1wp5gofs 
also - if you are creating forms in formscentral desktop application and need to edit those forms further in acrobat xi (such as to add your own submit button) see this faq on editing formscentral pdfs: http://forums.adobe.com/docs/doc-3661
