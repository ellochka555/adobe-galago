<s>you need to set up a job with two inks.</s><s> i would advise that you check with your printer before starting.

<s>there is a solution!</s><s> you actually go to your "printers and faxes" (under the start menu if in windows.</s><s>) then you choose "acrobat distiller" properties (by right clicking on acrobat distiller from the "printers and faxes" window), then "printing preferences" then "adobe pdf" tab to change settings.</s><s> you will see a checkbox that is probably checked for "do not send fonts to distiller." you can uncheck that and look at any other settings you might want to change at this point before you save and exit out of this window. 
</s><s>you see, the "export pdf" command in pdf relies on that distiller setup in your "printers and faxes" window.</s><s> making a pdf is really generated through the print feature.</s><s> and exporting directly from pagemaker to pdf makes a shotty pdf, unless you are only using it for viewing (if you are using to have it printed anywhere, you wouldn't want to rely on those results).</s><s> the best method is to make a postscript first by choosing file, print, and then choosing acrobat distiller instead to print a postscript to a certain location, and then you would tell that postscript to open in your acrobat distiller (where you have set up your job settings as you would like the pdf quality to be). 
</s><s>it seems like everytime an acrobat update happens, it wipes out the setting in the print setup windows of acrobat distiller and adobe pdf.</s><s> i have to go back and change these to how i like them when i notice this problem. 
i actually have more tricks for successfully exporting pdf's directly out of pagemaker, so if you want them, let me know!</s><s> it's a little work intensive after another inevitable acrobat update, but it's worth it for what i have to do--- and if you want to be sure those pdf's embed the fonts!

<s>from the pm faqs over ten years ago: <quote>
<s>12:03pm may 17, 02 pst 
</s><s>opentype or unicode is the latest development in fonts. 
</s><s>they allow an enormous number of characters within a single font and are advantageous for typesetting in foreign languages that can comprise many more glyphs than a 255-character ansi set can contain.</s><s> they also allow the inclusion of traditional typographic features like small caps, text figures, ligatures, etc. 
</s><s>as cool as all that is, you won't be able to take advantage of these extended character sets with pagemaker. 
</s><s>there is currently no support for opentype for pagemaker.

<s>willmark, we seem to be talking about completely different things.</s><s> i haven't said a single word about an os x version of pagemaker.</s><s> almost since indesign made its first appearance, i realized that it was the result of trying to rewrite pagemaker from scratch to avoid problems with code dating from version 1.0 -first one i used.</s><s> it's therefore a long time since i accepted we will never see a carbonized pagemaker.</s><s> and i can even add another reason to your list in support of this unofficial fact: the adobe user to user forums survey (see acrobat forums) does not include pagemaker in the list of "adobe products you use".</s><s> trajan and you published consecutive messages in this thread saying you don't understand why there are so many people clinging to pagemaker.</s><s> i think i do understand, and have tried to explain why; no ranting coming from here.</s><s> you now give arguments against things i have not ever said or disputed.</s><s> my only other contribution to this one sided discussion has been to comment that it would be nice if adobe produced a very light version of indesign precisely in benefit of those who have been faithfull adobe clients for 400 years, but don't need the full capabilities of indesign to produce their monthly newsletters or whatever, don't have the money to pay for their upgrades, are too old or to busy or too lazy to face a not so level learning curve ..., and will be forced to move on to os x sooner or later.</s><s> people who need just a plain word processor are not forced to pay for the full parafernalia of ms word; there are much cheaper and completely satisfactory alternatives.</s><s> i am glad to see that you agree with me at least in thinking that there are no really valid alternatives to indesign.</s><s> because of this, i see nothing wrong in thinking that, if adobe can produce photodeluxe for people who have neither the need nor the money for all the wonderful capabilities of photoshop, they could equally well produce a modest carbonized indesign based layout program.</s><s> you seem to think that, instead, all these people should just buy indesign and simply not use any features they don't need.</s><s> in this we fully disagree.

<s>claudio, i usually agree with you so let me further clarify; in addition none of my previous posts were directed at you so please do not take them as such.</s><s> my suggestion to use id is very sound one for a number of reasons 1) contrary to what many pm users might believe id has a similar feature set, and interfaces, while not the same is more in line of what they experience now.</s><s> 2) cheaper upgrade path.</s><s> i'm willing to be that when id3 is released there will be some sort of new upgrade path to id for those that have pm. its a way no move forward and pm users should treat it as such, not idly complain that "adobe is abandoning us".</s><s> 3) dave has suggested this many times: move to id treat it as pm until you are comfortable.</s><s> when a pm user feels comfortable move onto some of the new features, thus gaining greater knowledge.</s><s> 4) this is kind of a personal thing but here's a great thought provoker.</s><s> maybe graphic design isn't for everyone.</s><s> this seems to be adobe's mindset.</s><s> adobe seems to be of the mindset that they are going to only push forward a professional osx client (to everyone who wants to jump on me for this statement: arguing whether or not pm is professional grade or not is not relevant for this thread.</s><s>) again, if you look at intent, its seems to me that adobe is more interested in the professional graphic design market than the home user, casual user one.</s><s> im also speculating that adobe is trying to funnel those users who use pm into id to give them even more leverage against quark in the graphic design market on osx.</s><s> 5) it looks like for the casual user that framemaker is the direct that adobe is wanting people to go.</s><s> i will say framaker is a program i freely admit i do not know a great deal about.</s><s> 6) pms current position today came about in a highly unusual set of circumstances that are unlikely to repeat themselves.</s><s> pm was once a standard before quarks rise to dominance.</s><s> pm was cutting edge then.</s><s> i would say that it is in the backseat now that id is in its 4th version coming up.</s><s> pm has become a intermediate design tool by accident, not by design.</s><s> in other works aldus did not intend to create a middle-of the road design program, it just happened that way.</s><s> while i can understand the frustration of the pm install base i just dont see how this is going to resolve in the i want my pm on osx camps favor.</s><s> if anything this is a non-issue, with very few cheap alternatives.

<s>bob it can really affect the quality more than a little, when outputting to print vector text gets rasterized at the resolution of the printer, which for offset printing can be as high as 2540 dpi.</s><s> quality for web pdfs is a lot better with vector text, and the size of the pdfs is a lot smaller.</s><s> but s for some jobs it can be good enough, frankly with pagemakers lack of ability with pdfs it can be more trouble than it's worth. 
</s><s>double check the color of your black text when you rasterize a pdf in photoshop, first off it's difficult to tell what color mode the pdf is in and if the person is actually using 100% k text and secondly the conversion in photoshop can change the color (using a custom cmyk conversion with max gcr is a way to ensure 100%k in photoshop).</s><s> indesign has a separations palette that makes checking entire documents much easier.</s><s> if you have acrobat pro you can use it's separation palette to check your pdfs from pagemaker
