<s>hello, Ê this is the problem we are having Ê when a designer opens an indesign file that is stored on a network share through indesign, and an editor tries to open the same indesign file through incopy, the error message "this file is already open by another user or another application.</s><s> this file may be stored on a network server and cannot be opened until the other user closes it." is displayed.</s><s> to get around this issue, the designer must close out of the file in indesign, and the editor must open the indesign file in incopy before the designer reopens the indesign file using the indesign application.</s><s> this issue did not occur in 9.1.</s><s> adobe support has stated that files cannot be used at the same time in incopy and indesign, but that is the function that the product was designed to accomplish and this issue has never occurred before.</s><s> the files are stored on a shared network. Ê also, when an editor updates an assignment from incopy and a designer clicks on the updated assignment to update their view from indesign, the error message "the content is locked and cannot be modified." is displayed.</s><s> if the designer clicks ok, the view is updated as expected.</s><s> this occurs even is the assignment is not checked out by another user. Ê finally, if a designer adds or updates a graphic inside of an indesign file using indesign while an editor is editing the file using incopy, the editor using incopy will not see the update unless they completely close out of the incopy application and reopen it, which due to the above problems, is not feasible.</s><s> the only way the file can be updated in incopy is for the designer to completely close out of the file, for the editors to then close out, and reopen in incopy, at which point the designer may reopen the file.</s><s> if some editors are away from their desks at the time of update, the entire process must be repeated in order for them to be able to open the most recent version of the file in incopy.</s><s> this issue appears to be due to a major flaw in the 9.2 version update for indesign, as none of these issues occurred before the 9.2 update.</s><s> one computer currently still has the 9.1 version of indesign at our company, and does not experience these problems we are having with 9.2.</s><s> we have tested multiple configurations of our network trying to rule out our network as the problem, but the only case in which we don't experience these problems is when we use indesign version 9.1.Ê also, we never experienced this problem before the update of indesign and incopy to 9.2.

<s>graham, thank you for such a detailed post and screenshots.</s><s> an incopy client group of mine alerted me to the issue and pointed me to this thread.</s><s> i've passed it along to some adobe indesign/incopy product managers and engineers, and hope to see their replies here soon (and a fix, fingers crossed). 
</s><s>in the meantime, a workaround that's not *too* onerous would be use assignments.</s><s> incopy users on 9.2 can open assignments without an issue, as far as i can tell.</s><s> if you're using a layout-based workflow (as most of my clients are), all this means is that you have your designers take one more step when prepping their id file, and that is, to create an assignment that is the *entire* indesign file, effectively turning it back into a layout-based workflow. 
</s><s>they create the assignment by clicking the new assignment button at the bottom of the assignments panel, no need to enter anything in the "assigned to:" field or change any other defaults, making sure indesign saves it to the project folder on the server. 
</s><s>say they name the assignment "april issue." if they've already exported stories, just drag them from the unassigned incopy content category onto the april issue category, and then update the assignment (they can right-click on it to update, or choose update assignment from the panel menu).</s><s> if they export more/new stories, have them export them or drag/drop them to that same assignment. 
</s><s>tell your incopy users not to open the indd file anymore.</s><s> instead have them go into the project folder's assignments folder (which id created automatically) and open the assignment file there.</s><s> "april issue.icma" in this example. 
</s><s>multiple incopy users can open the same assignment file concurrently, just as they could open the same indd file concurrently.</s><s> they still check stories in and out as usual.</s><s> still only one indesign user can have the file open at once. 
</s><s>the only other change in workflow is that the designer will have to remember to always update the assignment whenever it changes.</s><s> saving changes to the indesign file does not automatically update the assignment (icma) file.they might want to assign a keyboard shortcut to that command.

<subject>Layout in InCopy does not match InDesign</subject>
<post author="technothrakon" timestamp="Feb 26, 2014 9:39 AM">
<s>hello - 
</s><s>i have a designer having an issue where the layout in incopy is not reflective of the correct layout in indesign.</s><s> in indesign cc (v9.2) the body/story flows and is interrupted by several images and quote sections, as you can see in this example image: 

</s><s>but, when i save the body and the pull quote sections into incopy assignments and open them in incopy cc (also version 9.2), incopy ignores that the text should break at the quote and the images, and displays the layout improperly.</s><s> i've highlighted some text being obscured behind the image for demonstration purposes.</s><s> the text in the assignments is still workable, and otherwise the assignments appear to function without issue.</s><s> but the functionality of the system as a whole breaks down our process where we're trying to avoid making pdf proofs of documents to check the layout.

</s><s>saving the file as idml did not appear to have an effect (same issue in incopy, though i did not try removing the assignment altogether and re-creating, just updated the existing assignment).</s><s> i've also tried removing the inset objects and creating new ones that have proper text wrap options, and also removing the text object for the body and recreating that on the page - still getting the same issue.</s><s> so i'm theorizing that the issue doesn't exactly have to do with the individual elements on the page, but some underlying setting similar to what you were alluding to in your previous post.

</s><s>in answer to your questions: 
yes we work off of a server.</s><s> all windows environment here.</s><s> the ic users also work off a server.</s><s> the indd files are in one shared location exclusive to designers.</s><s> the ic users access icma files from a different shared location that both designers and editors can access.</s><s> when i mention 'security' above, it's in that context: right now the ic users can't access the indd files.</s><s> granting that access is not that difficult, but it opens up more hands into a shared folder which ultimately results in more support for me when someone accidentally moves/deletes something.</s><s> but it is something to consider, and maybe we can go with security that restricts delete and possibly create rights.</s><s> but i digress. 
</s><s>as i said they are working off a windows file server.</s><s> there are layers in this document but they're not being utilized effectively.</s><s> by that i mean that the text is sitting in the 'footers' layer right now, while the objects in question (pull quote, images) are on a layer called 'text'.</s><s> from what i can tell these are not anchored objects.</s><s> the pull quote and pictures will stay in a static position on the page and the text will wrap around it, and position does not change if text is added or removed, unless the designer moves the object.</s><s> forgive me, i'm an it nerd being asked to figure this out so i might not have the terminology correct! 
</s><s>if we're talking a single assignment scenario, is that really no different than opening up the indd file directly?</s><s> if the designer makes layout changes, do the ic users just get a notice to update the layout as in a regular assignment?

<s>hi gurus all over the world! 
something strange happened with my incopy, when i export an assignment from indesign the incopy recieves the text frame one grid below (you can see that) 
left, indesign file right incopy file 
so, like always, i think is a indy problem and save to cs4 when i open the .idml back it has a inset space in the frame (you can barely see the green frame), so i'm assuming that is what is happening with my incopy files 


no need to say that some frames with one line only are dissapearing because of that, and no editing work is possible 
ive checked the default object styles and nothing there. 
i accept all kind of strange solutions!

- find an icml file needing updating, delete it from assignment. - cut and paste new content from the incopy .icma files into the appropriate textbox in indesign, using the pasteboard preference to maintain all information. - recreate the icml assignment. - repeat for each icml that needs updating.

<s>ok, did you look at the report?</s><s> it's actually a lot clearer than i had expected: 
unhandled error condition

</s><s>session started up at 7:10 am on monday, january 14, 2013
</s><s>version: 8.0.1 - build: 406

</s><s>error code 0x20705: "the content is locked and cannot be modified."


</s><s>called to process command 0x1352f
</s><s>command processor stack (from top to bottom):
6.</s><s> command 0x13517 "delete hyperlink destination"
</s><s>5. command sequence "re-import file"
4. command 0x7314 "re-import file"
3. command sequence "update"
2. command sequence ""
1. command 0x8c59 "update link"

</s><s>error code 0x20705: "the content is locked and cannot be modified."


</s><s>called to process command 0x1352f
</s><s>command processor stack (from top to bottom):
9.</s><s> command 0x13517 "delete hyperlink destination"

4. command 0x8c59 "update link"
3. command 0x18e38 "relink story"
2. command sequence "relink story"
1. command sequence "update story" 
</s><s>so, in both cases, indesign crashed because it encountered something that was locked while it was trying to delete a hyperlink destination (or crossreference) while updating a linked file (presumably incopy file). 
</s><s>so, if your document makes use of locked objects, or hyperlink destinations, you can mess around with them and try to see if you can eliminate the problem.

<s>strange.</s><s> i can assure you that for the vast majority of users, this doesn't happen.</s><s> if ic or id says a story can't be checked out because it's already in use, then that means for some reason an .idlk (lock file) didn't get deleted from the server when the story was checked back in by the previous user.</s><s> the lock files get created and deleted silently by id and ic behind the scenes (in the same folder as the incopy stories-- the incx files -- themselves), and their presence/absence is what id/ic check to let you know if a story is available or in use.</s><s> so if a user doesn't have the correct read/write permissions for a particular folder on a server, then he'll have trouble trying to check out a story to edit it (because his system is not allowed to write to the server folder -- to create the .idlk file) or he won't be able to truly check a story back in (because his system isn't allowed to delete files from the server folder -- to delete the .idlk file).</s><s> barring user error, this is why whenever people report problems regarding ic/id not letting them check stories in/out, i normally suggest they check with their it department and make sure the all the user's permissions are set correctly.</s><s> i've seen it happen that most people's systems are okay but it forgot to turn a switch or click a checkbox for one or two other users in the department.</s><s> am

<s>i'm sorry, morgan, but from your most recent reply, i really can't tell what you're doing exactly, which makes it difficult to give you advice. Ê this time i had a look at the editors pc using incopy and opened the links panel.</s><s> inside the links panel i was able to go to utilities\search for missing links, funny how it works in the links panel and not in the assignments panel? Ê first, incopy cs4 default settings are to automatically search for missing links when you open a file (edit > preferences > file handling).</s><s> the only time that links panel menu > utilities > search for missing links actually turns up something is if either 1) the default preference was turned off when the file was opened; or 2) the links became missing *after* the file was opened. Ê so i'm really surprised to hear that using this command from the links panel menu did anything for you.</s><s> is that preference turned off in your user's copies of incopy?</s><s> or is someone moving linked story files out of the folder they were originally exported to?</s><s> or neither? Ê 1.</s><s> story and galley view do not come back - have to edit in layout view only. Ê i've never heard of that before.</s><s> you're positive the user can *edit* in layout view (and not just look at it, or copy text from it to paste in a different file)? Ê or maybe the user is in indesign by mistake?</s><s> (if a user has both apps installed on the same machine, believe me, this happens a lot.</s><s>) Ê i'm really doubting the user can edit in layout view.</s><s> it sounds like the file he opened in incopy cannot find its linked stories, and in that case, yes, you can only see layout view.</s><s> (but you can't edit it ...</s><s> no stories to check out.</s><s>) you can an alert explaining this when you open the file. Ê 2. can not save the fact that the links are now found.</s><s> so if the editor close the indesign file and reopened it, he would have to search for all those links again (all up on his machine would take 4 or more minutes, estimated). Ê incopy cannot save any changes to an indd file or to an assignment (icma, in cs4) file.Ê only indesign can do that.</s><s> the only thing that incopy can save is the content of incopy (icml, in cs4) files.Ê that's why the command is save content and not just save ... when you choose save content, you're saving the edits you made to the checked-out story's contents .. in other words, to the external icml file. Ê the location (file path) of links is a property of the indd file, so incopy can't save those changes. Ê morgan, you still haven't answered my earlier question (i know you probably forgot it ...</s><s> no problem) ... the next time you have the problem of incopy opening a file and reporting missing links, but they're not missing in indesign, please jot down: Ê the filepath that indesign reports for one of those links, the filepath that incopy reports for that same link, andÊ the actual filepath of the link on the server, starting from the drive's name. Ê the easiest way to get the answers to #s 1 and 2 is to select the link in the links panel of the program in question, and choose utilities > copy full path from the links panel menu. Ê am

3.</s><s> "you're positive the user can *edit* in layout view (and not just look at it, or copy text from it to paste in a different file)?" yes i am positive.</s><s> i did a test and edited a few stories and closed the magazine file from incopy on his pc and opened it in indesign from my mac and the changes where made.</s><s> i accepted the changes and they work.</s><s> the editor does not have a version of indesign on his machine.
