<s>no worries - when we find the solution, it will probably be useful for both products.

<post author="SaurabhCheenu" timestamp="Jul 19, 2010 2:16 AM">
<s>
</s><s>hello, 
</s><s>i installed flashbuilder4 trial version which is not a standalone application but rather eclipse plugin, in my latest eclipse installation which is eclipse helios 64 bit version.</s><s> the installation went on smoothly but after i restarted my eclipse instance and upon clicking the flex module from properties menu it popped up quite a few issues. 
i did some research and came to know that adobe is not supporting 64 bit version of eclipse.

<s>we strongly desire to use the new 64-bit eclipse helios jee platform for our development, and plug the flash builder 4 plug-in into it.</s><s> our applicaiton is a large enterprise application with a java server-side and a flex client side.</s><s> we have about 50 engineers and 50 professional service people that use this platform.</s><s> our engineers and professional services people work on the entire code at once... switching between two different ides is a real pain.</s><s> we did that originally but then figured out how to get the flex builder 3 plug-in installed into our existing java enterprise eclipse ide and have been much happier since. 
</s><s>we have 100+ projects, 50,000+ files, 2.5 million lines of code, and use over 150 third-party jars.</s><s> working in a 32-bit ide is now too much of a pain point.</s><s> we've hit the wall on the 32-bit jvm... we allocate 256m to permgen (just about enough) and 1024m to heap.</s><s> this is a compromise heap size: its not enough heap: compiling and validating everything is always slow and sometimes it fails or hangs thrashing near out of heap space, but it is also too much: we often get other kinds of oom errors (native memory, etc) because the heap is too large.</s><s> the 32-bit address space is just too limited for our ide needs.</s><s> thus, we absolutely need to switch to a 64-bit ide.</s><s> in our trials with the 64-bit helios, we allocate 2048m of heap and full builds builds are about 50% faster, and so far, not a single crash from other oom conditions.</s><s> problem is... the flash builder 4 plug-in will install nicely with no errors or warnings, but does not work (many of its .dlls are 32-bit dlls and it fails because it can't load the native library for bridgetalk). 
</s><s>when will adobe release a flash builder 4 plug-in that will work with the 64-bit version of eclipse helios?</s><s> helios is the 64-bit revolution for eclipse... every package that is available (classic, java, jee, etc) is now available in both a 32-bit and a 64-bit download.</s><s> adobe should follow suit. 
</s><s>david williams over on the eclipse.org forums answered this question with this answer: "in an ideal world, a p2 install [of flash builder 4] would automatically pick out the right platform version [32-bit or 64-bit] and you'd work with either one transparently." 
http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=msg&goto=545212&#msg_545212 
thus, we'd like to officially like to request this feature.</s><s> is this the proper place ot make a feature request?

<s>how do you monitor the demand?

<s>well, i would echo what j.c.</s><s> hamlin wrote (far above). 
</s><s>we've got a very large project with a large java component as well as many flex projects.</s><s> developing in one ide is very convenient in that code refactoring, searching, deployment to the test environment, etc. is all integrated into one ide instance.</s><s> however, in our environment, the heap/memory limitations of a 32-bit jvm constrain the performance of eclipse with our projects and all the plugins that we use. 
</s><s>we're constantly trying to balance heap, maxperm, etc. to tune, but we're totally crunched down by the 32-bit jvm 2g limit, and even below that because of windows overhead and whatever eclipse itself is doing.</s><s> when you get it wrong, sometimes eclipse will simply just die, and restoring the workspace to its former state is not always easy and quick. 
</s><s>even more concerning is that our product as well as eclipse and our other plugin tools (including flashbuilder) is a long-lived one and continues to grow.</s><s> looking down the road, therefore, heap space will continue to be more and more of a limitation. 
</s><s>our entire development department and many others' that i've talked with use 64-bit os versions to allow application development with fewer memory constraints.</s><s> eclipse 64-bit works great unless you must have a 32-bit-only plugin.</s><s> myeclipse 9 now supports 64-bit on windows. 
</s><s>having flashbuilder as a 64-bit compatible plugin would not only help address this case, but also put you in line with where i would imagine the future of operating systems are eventually heading.</s><s> maybe it will take a few years, but how long before 32-bit apps are as obsolete as 16-bit ones?

<s>andrew, 
</s><s>i think i've stated *our* reasons in a message earlier.</s><s> due to the size of our codebase and number of projects and third-party libraries, the helios 32-bit version just simple can't import, compile, and function properly.</s><s> we run out of memory (either heap space if heap is too small, or out of some other native memory resource if heap is too large).</s><s> when eclipse crashes like this, sometimes getting interrupted to get your workspace back into a usable state can be a real pain. 
</s><s>we want to use an *integrated* development environment (the key word being integrated) which means running helios 64-bit for all of our work (java, jsp, database, etc) and flex development.</s><s> without the integration (i.e. being forced to run two ides 32-bit flash builder 4 for flex and 64-bit helios for java/jsp) refactoring, search, search and replace, svn commit/update, deployment and testing, just becomes a pain.</s><s> so, until flash builder 4 comes as a plug-in that plugs into our 64-bit helios enviornment, we're forced to run two ides and have a non-integrated development environment.</s><s> this is a real pain. 
</s><s>i'm guessing this will be the primary concern you will hear expressed here. 
</s><s>eclipse is wonderful, but its also a memory hog, and helios is even moreso than ever (i.e. our project used to work, barely, in 3.4.</s><s> it sort-of worked in 3.5.</s><s> it does not work in heloios [3.6] because we can't even allocate a heap large enough).</s><s> helios provides even more features than ever, it also needs more memory to function.</s><s> this problem will continue to get worse over time so that even smaller projects than ours start to bump into the 32-bit/2g limit.

<s>actually, the reason i added the reference to the requirements for plugin usage is simply to point out that the instructions given by adobe do indeed work as advertised, noting the following: 
1) software, by its nature, has compatability requirements, and in this case eclipse must be 3.6 to 3.7.</s><s> the original question stated that "it must be a bug with the installer", where that simply isn't the case.</s><s> the installer works well within the stated requirements.</s><s> the original poster is assuming that the plugin must work with post 3.7 eclipse verions, which it clearly does not. 
2) toshe-de did indeed suggest a "workaround" to the adobe requirements, and as noted, there may be risks to this down the road.</s><s> this is just the way it is, however, when one wants to exceed a vendor's requirements or limitations.</s><s> it is quite obvious to all that eclipse is moving on, while flashbuilder is not.</s><s> apparently, adobe is not committed to continuing fb development, and so in the mean time...life goes on.

<s>hi all, 
</s><s>a few possibly helpful additional tidbits.</s><s> i am using flash builder 4.5 (not 4.6 - i work with cs extension builder, and that works better with 4.5 than with 4.6).</s><s> i experienced the exact same symptoms as the original poster (lawrencem49).</s><s> using mac os x 10.7.4.</s><s> have also installed cs6 on the same computer. 
</s><s>after trying all the obvious things for naught, i rolled back my computer one day based on the nightly image backups i make, and things started working again.</s><s> then a dreamweaver cs5.5 update came in through the update manager.</s><s> i allowed it to proceed, and subsequently discovered the problem was back. 
</s><s>not sure whether the two are related, but i do remember that the same dreamweaver update came through yesterday some time before the trouble started. 
</s><s>this morning i removed and reinstalled fb 4.5 and it works again. 
</s><s>so i have a suspicion the dreamweaver cs5.5 update might be the culprit or at least involved in breaking things.
