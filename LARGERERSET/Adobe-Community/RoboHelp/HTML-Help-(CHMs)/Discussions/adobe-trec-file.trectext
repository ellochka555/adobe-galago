<s>i have rh 9, so can't speak for rh10, but for rh 9 x64 anyway, i think it partially sort of works.</s><s> i mean, i got it to do something, but i don't know if it's quite working the way it should. Ê plus, it's hard to know, because the rh help needs more info on how to use this tool.</s><s> here's what i tried doing: Ê i run it from the view | pods submenu. - check the message in the bughunter tab says says to enable it, i have to select the tools menu and choose enable bughunter.</s><s> it now says "bughunter enabled..." - check Ê but then what?</s><s> do i just use any application as usual and press f1 and it intercepts the call?</s><s> being confused on this point, i naturally go to the help on bughunter http://help.adobe.com/en_us/robohelp/9.0/robohtml/ws5b3ccc516d4fbf351e 63e3d11aff59c571-7fe0.html#ws5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d11aff59c571-7fdb and view this subtopic "test with bughutner for html help" Ê it says...</s><s> "note: microsoft html help projects only." - check. Ê it also says...</s><s> "note: before you start using bughunter, you must launch html help workshop once.</s><s> to launch html help workshop, double-click the hhw.exe file in the html help workshop install folder." - confusion Ê hmmm.</s><s> okay.</s><s> so i do a search on my c:\ drive for hhw.exe, but the search can't find it.</s><s> i then figure i have to install it.</s><s> i download and install the html help workshop from microsoft to the default c:\program files (x86)\ location.</s><s> (by the way, windows said a newer version was already installed.</s><s>) Ê anyway, i try to run the html help workshop (hhw.exe) once per the instructions.</s><s> but it don't open if i have bughunter enabled.</s><s> so, i disable bughunter and run it.</s><s> then try to re-enable bughunter.</s><s> i get this message: Ê "html help bughunter cannot be enabled while the microsoft html help workshop is running." Ê curious, because clearly the rh help file told me to run it first.</s><s> but i dutifully close down the workshop and re-enable bughunter.</s><s> perhaps what i did was sufficient? Ê going back to the bughunter help... Ê "to start capturing data, right-click inside the pane and select enable bughunter.</s><s> the output dialog box displays capture data while the program is enabled.</s><s> " - check.yup i re-enabled it. Ê then this: "when you activate help in an application's dialog box, messages from bughunter appear in the output window." -- fail. Ê to me, this means bughunter should be intercepting the f1 calls somehow from our application.</s><s> or am i misinterpreting it?</s><s> or do i need to do something special for it to know i'm calling that application's help?</s><s> anyway, if i press f1 in our application, the help launches as expected, but no messages appear in the bughunter output window.</s><s> (i even tried running our application through rh's file | context sensitive help | open application menu item and pressing f1 within our app.</s><s> same story.</s><s> help ran fine, but not output message.</s><s>) Ê the closest i can get to bughunter doing anything is if i right-click on the bughunter output pane and choose "test html help api" from the popup menu and a dialog box of the same name appears.</s><s> i browse to a chm file of ours.</s><s> for command, i choose hh_help_context, and in map number, i type a number and then i click test.</s><s> only then does bughunter do something and display info on the mapping. Ê i can't get hh_display_topic to do anything.</s><s> i've tried map number and help file for html file and nothing ever happens.

<s>i get your point about chm and falling sort of "behind the times".</s><s> i've been a huge chm fan for seemingly eons.</s><s> i've loved the ability to package things into a single file and have it ship and the fact there is no external application needed in order for folks to use it on windows systems.

</s><s>it's been about a year ago, but i had a conversation with a high ranking adobe person that advised that adobe had performed a study and chm was still among one of the most widely used output types.</s><s> so that reason alone would seem to mandate that chm output remain a viable option for the time being.

<post author="rasterdan" timestamp="May 24, 2013 1:06 PM">
<s>i write a lot of service procedures.</s><s> our field people like the procedures to flow top to bottom only without hyperlinks all over the book to remind how to perform various procedures. 
</s><s>using snippets inside dhtml dropdown boxes, i can provide information to our field techs who need detailed steps and others can just perform the step without having to read a bunch of details they already know.</s><s> some snippet steps use information that is repeated all over the book so i would like to put a snipped within a snippet for the novice field guys who really need to know every last screw to turn step by step. 
</s><s>rh9 will not allow putting a snippet inside a snipped.</s><s> further, if you have too many levels of dhtml dropdown boxes within other dropdown boxes, it gets confused.</s><s> once rh9 let me put a snippet inside a snippet and it worked for 5 minutes and then crashed our project.</s><s> it took hours to undo that one but we finally got version control to go back in time and then we were ok. 
</s><s>my question, is there any plan to allow snippets within snippets or can that feature be added to the request bin?</s><s> also, is it possible for the rh people to test multiple levels of dhtml drop boxes with dhtml drop boxes?</s><s> ... say 3 or 4 deep? 
</s><s>having procedures that flow from top to bottom only is becoming more and more important, especially when using tablet devices.</s><s> scrolling around and hyperlinking is a hassle and easy for our techs to get lost.</s><s> the dropdown boxes are working beautifully but we are just having a lot of trouble stacking them several deep in some more complex procedures.

<s>so, i'm trying to use the script provided by microsoft in the link given above to open an external pdf.</s><s> we're trying to link to a .pdf file that's going to be installed with our software but is going to be one directory above and then down into a "en" directory relative to the chm location.</s><s> so the relative link i'm using is:

</s><s>the same link to a simple text file in that same directory works fine with the script, but for some reason a link to a pdf doesn't work.</s><s> has anyone else seen this, or does anyone have an idea on how to do a relative link from a chm to a .pdf file outside of the project in a different directory?

<s>you can set the initial size of the chm file window inside your robohelp project.</s><s> all you need to do is create a window designed specifically for use with your chm files.</s><s> this allows you to define the window properties including its size.</s><s> you then need to ensure you have used that window inside the microsoft html help single source layout.

</s><s>finally i stated that this only sets the initial window size.</s><s> there is nothing to stop a user resizing the window.</s><s> i am pretty sure that when they do this, their size setting is recorded and used the next time they open the chm file.</s><s> this is recorded in the hh.dat file on the end user's pc.</s><s> you can read more about this file here.

<s>ok but at least we have reached some common ground. 
</s><s>this does have all the hallmarks of a bug but before i can pursue that, i need to get things a bit more consistent. 
</s><s>first of all, in the project you sent me i am having trouble removing those dhtml effects.</s><s> if i go to popup1 and remove the effect, then change from design view to html view and back, the dhtml effect is back.</s><s> i cannot get rid of it in a way that sticks.</s><s> do you get the same?

</s><s>where i am heading is giving you the choice of dhtml with popups that do not position right from image maps or no dhtml and popups that do position, with or without blank space at the bottom.</s><s> i know this is not what you want but if it is a bug you may have to accept one of those options pending a fix.</s><s> when is your next delivery?

<s>thanks, peter.</s><s> i'm glad you were able to confirm the problem and that it's not just my machine or version of something.

<s>hi karen 
</s><s>i think it would be perfectly acceptable to have in your software release notes or specs that if your customers are using ie 9, there are known problems. 
</s><s>personally, i have to smile at the comment you made where you say "asking tens of thousands of customers to uninstall..". 
i don't question that you say you have tens of thousands of customers.</s><s> what i do question is that you believe all your customers always upgrade to the latest and greatest browser when it arrives.</s><s> my own guess is that it will affect far far fewer than you believe because let's face it.</s><s> folks are lazy (myself included) and they just won't install newer versions of the browser. 
</s><s>one possible workaround i could fathom would be to install the pdf and other files separate to the chm in a known folder location.</s><s> then create html pages that redirect to open the files and store those in the same location.</s><s> then create absolute links to where these pages reside.</s><s> my thought is that this should remove the chm from the picture entirely.</s><s> once they successfully open the external html page you are handing things off to the browser, no?

Ê i then looked again at the html of the topics with the wrong format.Ê and i compared that html to that of the topics that worked correctly.Ê i noticed a difference in the <meta> tags.Ê there were some that related to the "topic".Ê here's what those tags looked like: Ê <meta name="date" content="10 18, 2001 12:55:25 pm" /> <meta name="topic-status" content="in progress" /> <meta name="topic-priority" content="0" /> <meta name="topic-time-estimate" content="0" /> <meta name="topic-comment" content="" /> <meta name="topic-id" content="wealocation_maintenance.htm" /> Ê many (not sure if all) of the topics that generated incorrectly had the "topic-id" with the htm file name as the content.Ê that one was suspicious.

</s><s>i have a similar problem.</s><s> in my case, the font is correct, but the paragraph is displaying with a regular bullet instead of the image notea.gif.</s><s> and i'm generating webhelp, so the html is not "compiling" in the chm sense.

<s>in another project, which uses the same css as the other one, the same symptom occurred.</s><s> for the topics that compiled incorrectly - to use the default.css rather than the css for the project - the <link> had the "text/css" type for the stylesheet, when i looked at the html in the project.</s><s> however, "text/css" was not there when i did a view source on the compiled topic in the chm.</s><s> so, leads me to suspect that something is happening in the compile to chm.</s><s> this seems to be the case for all of the topics displaying without the project's css styles.</s><s> so, why would it be there in the topic in the project, but not there when i view source in the compiled chm output?
