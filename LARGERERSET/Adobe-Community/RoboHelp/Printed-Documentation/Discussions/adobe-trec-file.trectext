i did do some tweaks that made it look better.</s><s> basically i structured it so that the msgboxtitle div is now inside the msgbox div.</s><s> something like this: 
<div class="msgbox"> <div class="msgboxtitle">pc-dmis message: </div> <p>please do the following steps in the indicated order.</p> <p>1.</s><s> remove the current sh-1/2/3 stylus.</p> <p>2.</s><s> attach the shsp (stylus holder setting piece).</p> <p>3.</s><s> jog the probe to a safe location with a clear line of approach to the port(s) being calibrated.</p> <p>4.</s><s> then click ok.</p> <p>after you click ok the machine will begin dcc measurement.</p> </div>

<s>oeri: 
</s><s>so if i have got it correctly the steps were: 
1] copy the rh templates to a temporary local folder. 
2] in word, point the user templates to that folder.

4] in word, point the user templates back to the original folder.

<post author="Garry2Rs" timestamp="Dec 16, 2013 10:05 AM">
<s>thanks, peter!</s><s> yes.., i understand that rh10 uses a word template for pdf output.</s><s> this is what i'm trying to avoid since i now append each htm to my output file, then use acrobat (or nuance pdf creator) pro to assign/set bookmarks/security.</s><s> i'd like to also avoid this if possible.</s><s> i don't see (nor understand) why adobe would persist a dependancy on ms office when it has the ability to do this directly from rh.</s><s> (if i can do it manually then surely they can do it programatically!</s><s>) 
</s><s>i've played with the settings for pdf output with no success/solution.</s><s> i get a completely different toc every time, which suggests the existing toc structure is ignored.</s><s> note that all elements are created in rh and so one would think they'd be recognized by the app that created them! 
</s><s>also, a different word template would be necessary if page layouts differ from project to project.</s><s> i don't see any provision in rh10 for doing page setups for printed documentation output. 
</s><s>perhaps the problem for me is more that i'm not a fan of ms word!</s><s> i thought doing pdfs from rh9 might be a better approach because the project in word is linked, but not so (as it turned out).</s><s> so basically, if a user doesn't have word (or ms office) installed then they're sol!</s><s> i invested in rh because i was looking to simplify my processes to a "single-source, multiple output" solution.</s><s> i already have working solutions for doing chm, webhelp, stand-alone html.exe, and pdf.</s><s> rh can't replace the html.exe solution, but i was hoping it would handle the rest.</s><s> (i don't need the various device output formats because all of them [except kindle perhaps] can access webhelp)

<s>going via word also generally produces a better document.</s><s> today i printed a single topic direct to pdf and the images were a mess that word fixes as it creates the document. 
</s><s>when you print you have choices, map the styles to a word template, use a single css to apply to all topics, or use the topics individual css files.</s><s> all three of them then create a single document with the styles defined. 
i have many projects and use the same word template for all.</s><s> the projects have different css files.</s><s> in the last page of the print dialog i map the project styles to the template styles.</s><s> if for some reason i do need a different appearance in a document i amend the word template or create a new one according to which is most expedient.</s><s> the word template gets changed in word. 
</s><s>yes having word installed is a prerequisite to importing from word, linking to word and generating printed documents.</s><s> as you are working with linked documents i assume you must have word and you will find using that is the way to go, your toc problem aside.</s><s> are you perhaps letting your word prejudice get in the way?

<s>i can't believe i am alone in having troubles with pdf output from rh (v10 as it happens) so here's an update on this. 
</s><s>first of all, i do think that if your company produces pdfs for clients, as complementary to webhelp, then you should use framemaker or word for your source files and for editing.</s><s> then import to rh when creating webhelp output.</s><s> there are simply too many issues when creating pdfs from rh, and too much manual manoevering to get round them.</s><s> i haven't seen issues with importing these files into rh in other projects. 
</s><s>my chief difficulties were that two tables in our english rh files refused to print beyond a page in printed documentation whereas in the japanese translations that returned from our vendor, nearly all the tables went off the page horizontally, again resulting in loss of text.</s><s> in addition, the pdf output had seemingly arbitrary blank pages inserted. 
i got round the table issue as follows: 1.</s><s> copy a table from the webhelp output and paste into word, save.</s><s> 2. import to rh, creating a html file.</s><s> 3. open this file in a browser, copy the table, and paste into the rh topic.</s><s> this worked, all other options i tried did not. 
i got round the blank page and other formatting issues by outputting to word from rh and working on the file there before outputting to pdf. 
i hope others can benefit from my experience.

<s>peter, thanks for your time on this.</s><s> i intended to reply to you today (after days of working full out on several projects) and i just got a mail from japan detailing problems with a japanese pdf that i created also. 
i can't spend any more time on this as i have other work to do.</s><s> i agree that the issues were introduced from word and from the html files returned from the translators but that is not really relevant to me in ths instance.</s><s> it's robohelp that has such difficulty in outputting them properly. 
</s><s>i've used robohelp for a year now, on two major projects.</s><s> it's a powerful tool.</s><s> however, if a company is producing pdfs for their clients i do not recommend outputting from rh.</s><s> you yourself often recommend outputting to word in this forum and manipulating before producing a final output. 
</s><s>in addition to the pdf issues, translation is a big issue for text in rh.</s><s> as mentioned, sending the html files for translation resulted in a lot of manual corrections on my part. 
</s><s>in one of our projects we work in word and import to rh for the webhelp files.</s><s> in the project i've spoken of (which uses a lot of conditional text) as we have framemaker, i'll be porting the rh files to frame, making use of the conditional functionality there, importing to rh as required for webhelp, and producing pdfs in frame.</s><s> (this should also solve the many translation issue we had with rh also).

<s>hi all, 
</s><s>i'm encountering an issue with index keywords in the print version of our help system (printed documentation layout).</s><s> i am using robohelp 10. 
</s><s>when i generate the print (word) version of a help system, the index entries appear before the topic heading rather than inline with the heading text.</s><s> here is an example: 

</s><s>this causes two problems.</s><s> first, extra space appears before the topic.</s><s> second, if a page break comes between the index entries and the topic heading, the index refers to the incorrect page. 
a co-worker at a different office also generates a word version of her product's help system and all of her index terms appear inline with the topic heading. 
</s><s>obviously, i can fix this once i have converted to word by moving the keywords into the heading.</s><s> however, there must be a way of taking care of this on the rh side so that i don't have to spend time correcting the word version. 
</s><s>my co-worker and i have compared settings within rh, as well as how we add index terms to our topics.</s><s> no answers there.</s><s> in addition, i have looked at the adobe help, reviewed the printed documentation information in peter grainge's site (excellent resource for rh!</s><s>) and combed through this forum.

<s>hi all, 
</s><s>i have suffered from missing images in word output for ages now.</s><s> but today i got a step closer to a solution. 
</s><s>here's the situation: i generate a word document to be used in the factory and a chm file to be used in the field; they contain alignment and adjustment procedures.</s><s> single-sourcing at its best, actually. 
</s><s>like evelyn, i had problems with images just being missing from the word doc, no error, no indication, nothing.</s><s> the first thing i found was that using images-link to document in the first screen of the printed documentation wizard resulted in an easily-seen red cross in the word doc when an image got lost.</s><s> also i found that removing spaces and other special characters from all image filenames seemed to help.</s><s> so i just manually plugged in the now easily-found lost images. 
</s><s>in the last few days, i generated a new version of both outputs, and a few (six out of about 200) images were missing.</s><s> i decided to investigate yet again, and found that the field (can be seen in word using alt-f9) of a 'lost' image had the form 
whilst a 'good' image had a field 

</s><s>note that one refers to directory ..\images (incorrect), the other to directory images (correct). 
i was unable to discover any rhyme or reason for this error, but it did suggest a workaround; after exporting from robohelp, i simply made a second copy of the images directory one level higher, so that word could find the images wherever it looked. 
</s><s>then i made my word document portable by embedding the images into it as follows: 1.</s><s> in word, select edit > links...</s><s> 2. select all the files listed in the dialog box (use shift-click) 3. check the checkbox save pictures in document 4. click ok 
it took a minute to embed all the pictures, but i could then save the word document and send it off to the factory to include in their database.

</s><s>hi peter, 
</s><s>i have had this problem for some time, and yes the topics did originally start life as word documents.</s><s> i have spent over a week concentrating on trying every possible solution including changing the file names of both the topics and the graphics, i.e removing all spaces, changing to lower case, reducing the the filename length.</s><s> i did find that one of your solutions to move the position of the topic in the toc structure did also work, but that was not suitable for my purposes.</s><s> following that i rebuilt the toc, which was quite a job on an 800 topic project, but even that did not work.</s><s> of course, i replaced the .cpd file on many occasions, also without success. 
</s><s>so, i was becoming quite frustrated with the whole thing, which made me more determined to find an answer.</s><s> then, this 'miracle' appeared and i just unchecked the 'update links on save' box and all was fixed.</s><s> i have no idea what the connection is, but it worked for me!</s><s> obviously, it was derek's post that gave me the clue as i also saw that the offending graphics had the field code with the "../images..." path.</s><s> after unchecking this box, the full file path is now used by word. 
</s><s>cheers,

</s><s>another problem caused me to wonder if there isn't a simple solution to this. 
</s><s>in both 8 and 9 if you enter a screentip its value gets written in robohelp 9 to the title property in the image tag. 
</s><s>in 9 the alt property is given the same value but in 8 it is left blank and reads alt="" 
</s><s>on generating the output rajib indicated that robohelp adds the path when the output is created if the alt value is blank. 
</s><s>i'm wondering if you could simply do a find and replace where the find is alt="" and the replace is something like alt="image".</s><s> in theory robohelp should find a value when generating and leave it alone and that is what you will get in your pdf.</s><s> you could also add title="image" to the replace string.
