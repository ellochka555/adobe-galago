<s>hello all, does anyone here generate javahelp 1.1.3?</s><s> i'm quite familiar with creating webhelp and epub using robohelp.</s><s> however, we have some javahelp projects i need to upgrade and the style mapping just seems random when displayed in the javahelp viewer (ie, mix of serif and sans serif fonts, even though my css has only sans serif fonts, fonts really tiny, etc).</s><s> webworks created javahelp beautifully but it would be good to use one product for our conversions.</s><s> any tips on how to get my stylesheet to work for producing javahelp?</s><s> thanks.</s><s>

<s>hi rick, 
</s><s>yes, the webworks html and css is pretty clean, i have to admit.</s><s> i can't apply the same css because robohelp and webworks don't work the same way - webworks creates the lists differently in the html(uses <div> and doesn't rely on css for the alignment of those items as robohelp does.</s><s> that's just one difference. 
i have worked with the css to create my webhelp output, but applying the same css for javahelp simply doesn't work (i found the same thing when creating epub output - the robohelp definitions for the aligning lists doesn't work for epub output.</s><s> i could be wrong, but i think that the xhtml required for epub is more strict and doesn't allow all the elements that the webhelp css uses). 
</s><s>for the javahelp, i'm suspecting it's because of the additional items robhelp includes in the css for list alignment and such.</s><s> as well, it's hard to go through the html because robohelp does insert a lot of formatting - in other words, the html isn't that clean.</s><s> i'll keep working on it, perhaps even creating new css from scratch and redoing all the frame to robohelp mappings, but i suppose i was hoping the point of being able to output to so many formats is not having to redo all this work.

<s>hi - i'm new to this forum and a new robohelp 8 user...i have to figure things out for myself since my employer is not offering to provide funds for training. 

i purchased robohelp 8 in january of this year for the purpose of creating a help system which will contain reference manuals (word format) that are associated with my company's java software package.</s><s> using robohelp 8 for word, i created a java project, imported 18 of my reference manuals, and batch generated with success (output - uncompressed javahelp with source output files).</s><s> i need the output to be "compressed javahelp" in order to create a .jar file which will ultimately be delivered to the software development team to be incorporated into the java code.</s><s> when i choose the "compressed javahelp" or "compressed javahelp with source files", i receive the following: 
sun java 2 sdk or later is required to compress the javahelp output.</s><s> please install the latest java sdk or choose "uncompressed javahelp" as your output option.</s><s> this javahelp wizard dialog box also contains an option to "locate sun java sdk install folder" button. 
i installed the following software packages in the in the c:\program files\java directory on my windows xp machine: jdk1.6.0_20 (latest from sun) (sdk is now jdk) jh2.0 jre6 
after installation and rebooting machine, i repeated the steps outlined above and i still received the same error message.</s><s> this time, i chose the "locate sun java 2 sdk install folder" and navigated to to the install folder.</s><s> i received the following message: "java software development kit (java sdk) is not installed in the folder". after selecting ok, the next message is "if you want to output compressed javahelp, the output file path can not contain "!". 
</s><s>when i attempt to view the javahelp (primary layout) from the single source layouts node, i receive the same "java 2 sdk and javahelp are required...message 
so, i gave up on this project for 3 months and now i'm receiving a deadline to have the project completed asap.</s><s> i spent 1/2 yesterday on the phone with adobe support and after uninstalling and reinstalling jdk, jh, and jre several times, the issue is being escalted to tier 2. 
</s><s>has anyone on this forum encountered this problem?</s><s> any information would be very much appreciated! 
</s><s>thanks - rie

<s>hi folks 
flash content can be made to work from cd with some additional free software and some minor modifications.</s><s> i've had to sort this with captivate projects that run from cd.</s><s> essentially the software is freeware that runs a very limited and lightweight web server.</s><s> because the flash player sees this as a web server it doesn't issue the normal errors it might otherwise issue when running outside of the software. 
</s><s>as for creating a single exe from flashhelp, it should be possible to accomplish as follows.</s><s> i have created exes from webhelp, so i can't imagine flashhelp would be that much different.</s><s> however, it could prove problematic to work from inside the exe file.</s><s> only testing will truly tell. 
</s><s>basically, you create the flashhelp output and package it up inside an ebook compiler to create the exe.</s><s> it's how i package many of my ebooks.</s><s> but i use webhelp and not flashhelp.</s><s> i'm happy to try and test packaging a flashhelp system as a exe file to see how it will behave but it won't be able to happen until later this week.</s><s> at the moment i'm sitting in the sanctuary of the church i attend where i'm assisting with a class.</s><s> tomorrow i'll be facilitating the second day of a captivate class.</s><s> i'm otherwise occupied most of the day on wed. if i get some time before then i'll post back with results.</s><s> otherwise, don't expect to hear anything until perhaps thursday.

<s>hi there 
i think i understand what is happening now.</s><s> thanks for the pictures.</s><s> they helped tremendously. 
</s><s>here's the deal.</s><s> there's search (with its own search tab) and there's index. 
</s><s>in search, the area is blank until you issue a search by typing what you are searching for and clicking a button or pressing enter.</s><s> at that point the webhelp scans all the topics and returns a list of topics containing the term(s) you searched for.</s><s> you click the links and see the topics. 
</s><s>with the index, you have a list of pre-programmed keywords.</s><s> the keywords often also exist inside the topics, but they don't have to be.</s><s> for example, perhaps you sell a product that resembles an albatross.</s><s> or maybe some special symbol in the software would resemble a happy man.</s><s> now you wouldn't necessarily have a descripton in the text that actually reads "happy man" or "albatross", but you could program some keywords that allowed the end user to find topics related to them by typing "happy man" or "albatross" into the index field. 
</s><s>in your case you seem to be reporting that the index isn't automatically adjusting itself as you type so that the programmed keyword is listed.</s><s> using the example i cited earlier, the end user might type h a p and they see "happy man" magickally float to the top of the list.</s><s> in this case they see what they want, click the entry and off they go without having to type the full "happy man" term out. 
</s><s>the index field actually does work like this.</s><s> but here's the twist.</s><s> this type of automatically adusting to match what you typed against the index terms in the list will only occur for "primary" level terms.</s><s> the terms you pointed to seem to be "secondary" level terms.</s><s> what you need to do in order to allow the index to work as you seem to be wanting is to also have the secondary terms listed as primary terms too. 
</s><s>this is actually more common than you might think.</s><s> for example, i used to work as a web developer for a division of the company that employed me.</s><s> part of my job entailed using robohelp to develop and maintain knowledge bases.</s><s> one of the knowledge bases was used heavily by the field services area.</s><s> they needed to be able to find customer information easily.</s><s> they might locate using customer name, customer number or customer location.</s><s> so i had a main index reference of customer numbers.</s><s> and all the customer numbers listed as secondary terms.</s><s> but the customer numbers also existed as primary terms in the event the rep began typing a customer number into the field. 
</s><s>hopefully i've understood the problem accurately and this better explains what is happening. 
</s><s>cheers...</s><s> rick

<s>keywords are not necessarily in the text of a topic as you can use any word as a keyword.</s><s> for instance you might have a topic all about clothing and assign cotton as a keyword even though it is not in the topic.</s><s> you are just wanting to point the user to a topic that might be relevant.</s><s> that is why the link just opens the topic.
