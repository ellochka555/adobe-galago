<s>thanks very much, willam. 
</s><s>to begin with, sorry for misspelling your name this whole time.</s><s> there is no phantom, second "i." poor editing job on my part for a tech writer. 
</s><s>we had our developer take a look at this html5 help today, and the ipad style, my default layout, works with an android phone and android tablet, but, ironically, not on an ipad itself.</s><s> so, i contacted adobe regarding this.</s><s> the look and feel needs to be consistent but as of now it's not.</s><s> here's what our developer wrote in an e-mail to those of us working on it: "robohelp is supposed to detect the device type and screen resolution and redirect to the appropriate page, but that does not appear to be working at all.</s><s> it sends the ipad to the android phone site, my android tablet to the ipad site, etc. none of it looks exactly the way it looks on kevin's preview through robohelp, even though i verified we have the same stylesheet." 
</s><s>what he is referring to concerning my preview is that the preview i see in rh after i generate the help is not accurate.</s><s> it is not what is truly being seen in the devices themselves.</s><s> so, i've been trying to make changes to the mobile.css file basing these changes on what i'm seeing in the rh preview, which is what we now know to be inaccurate and not truly what the user will see.</s><s> we believe that has to do with me running ie9 and ie9 not fully supporting html5.</s><s> so, that is a fixable issue on our end. 
i hope adobe can give us some guidance on the output problem, though.</s><s> when you wrote that html5 is no walk in the park, you were completely accurate.

<s>that's a pretty big question and you haven't given us any clues such as which version of robohelp you are using and whether it is just this form of help that is new to you or help in general. 
</s><s>it doesn't really matter whether you choose blank project or application help as they are just starters with different default topics and you will be trashing them anyway.</s><s> for now let's say start with blank project and create your topics.</s><s> you do need to keep in mind they will be viewed on various devices.</s><s> more about that later. 
</s><s>when that is done you start thinking about creating a suitable output.</s><s> multiscreen html5 is the output in robohelp 10.</s><s> robohelp 11 was released today and that has a new output, responsive html5.</s><s> that is simpler, especially first time out.</s><s> both of those types are intended for use where they will be viewed via a browser, be that on a desktop or a mobile device. 
</s><s>it is not clear whether you want your company's app to access help in that way or whether the need is for the help to be an app in its own right.</s><s> the latter adds another layer of learning.</s><s> essentially after creating an html5 output, you use the script to create an app.</s><s> from the questions you ask, i suspect you will need developer assistance with that. 
</s><s>start by viewing my page at http://www.grainge.org/pages/authoring/html5/html5.htm where you can download a project with information inside, include some ideas about how to write content.

<s>if you create multiscreen html5 (or responsive from rh11), then it needs to run in a browser.</s><s> i will be interested to learn how your developers plan to show the help within the app without the user going out to a browser.
