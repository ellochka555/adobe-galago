Ê problem onset: unable to determine when this first occurred, looked at older generated "pdf's" hence, there were no bookmarks; probably due to not having the option in word converting/publishing into adobe 'heading option' checked off. Ê description: in the adobe reader, click on the view->navigation panel->bookmarks (note: this can also be seen in word 2007 'document map' left pane), the navigation trees are not consistent. Ê expected result: the bookmark structure follows the structure of the document where the first level are chapters, second level of the navigation tree are topics, etc. Ê actual result: the bookmark structure is not consistent and shows things like "scenario 1", "figure 1" on the same level as chapter headings. Ê example #1: click on the + sign next to the introduction bookmark; Ê expected result: it should show introduction ->introduction ->support and training Ê actual result: introduction ->introduction Ê ->support and training Ê example #2: click on the + sign next to the preparing for database migration bookmark; Ê expected result: it should show; preparing for database migration ->required steps for certain versions of financials ->any version running on sql server 7.0 ->version 3.x running on sql server 2000 ->version pre-4.3.11 running on sql server 2000 ->version 4.3.11 or later running on sql server 2000 Ê actual result: preparing for database migration; ->required steps for certain versions of financials ->any version running on sql server 7.0 ->version 3.x running on sql server 2000 ->version pre-4.3.11 running on sql server 2000 1.</s><s> upgrade 4.3.11 or later to 4.6 while running under sql server 2000.</s><s> 2. upgrade sql server 2000 to sql server 2005/2008/2012. ->version 4.3.11 or later running on sql server 2000: scenario 1 scenario 2 Ê and so forth... Ê example #3: 1) open pdf 2) in the adobe reader click on the view->navigation panel->bookmarks; Ê expected result: the bookmark structure follows the structure of the document where the first level are chapters, second level of the navigation tree are topics, etc. Ê actual result: the bookmark structure is not consistent and shows things like "fdp", "2. click next." on the same level as chapter headings. Ê example #4 (visual): notice "step / action", this text is coming from robohelp as 'normal' styles and is mapped to word as a 'normal' styles but word is reading it as "outline level" (paragraph).</s><s> see sample word screenshots below. Ê attempts to rectify problem: this is not a problem if i generate a single chapter from robohelp toc 'chapter layout'.</s><s> i also tried all the chapters separately and there were no problems.</s><s> when i generate all 24 chapters from my toc 'chapter layout'Ê there are issues (e.g., single word like "step / action" text, nubered and bullited text become headings).</s><s> sample 1 sample 2 shown in this sample screenshot i include the html from robohelp

<s>hi, again, 
so, it sounds like your help file is fine and there is a problem with each user's computer.</s><s> do they experience the same problem with any other help files that they open? 
</s><s>perhaps you can ask one of the users to run mj's help diagnostics, available from the address below, and have them select the option to refresh the registration of all hh 1.x dlls.

if the problem persists, it would be good to see the report that mj's help diagnostics generates.</s><s> perhaps you can get that from the user and post it here. 
i don't think that reregistering hhctrl.ocx will make a difference; if one of the html help viewer components is at fault, it's most likely to be hh.exe.</s><s> either way, mj's help diagnostics should detect and resolve the problem. 
</s><s>some other things to watch for are excessively long folder paths down to the help file (should not exceed 256 characters) and non-alphanumeric characters in the path or file name (hash symbols, for example).

<s>hi michael.</s><s> 
</s><s>rick asked that question because there is a method of linking a word file to a robohelp project and bringing in any changes to them.</s><s> it was designed exactly for the scenario where a sme or client writes the content and someone else just acts as a kind of content curator.</s><s> however if you just want to import the word file, this is fine also but you'll need to understand that once the content is in robohelp, the content would need to be changed in robohelp.

<s>william, thanks for your reply.yes,i can quit robohelp once my scripting is done by robohelp.quit().but isn't there any other option to do automation with cli only?we want to automate this help integration for our build server.we want to change only doc file and then xpj project should automatically get developed from it and them through rhcl html o/p should be generated.but if during the build time,robohelp gui will open,even for few seconds,it wont be good.that is why i was looking for a cli interface which could do this automation thing.

</s><s>carma 
</s><s>i cannot say if word 2007 will fix your problem but assuming you have full licences for both versions of word, they should work ok.</s><s> i have both 2003 and 2010. it requires you open the required version of word and then close it or leave it running before you work with robohelp but that's all.</s><s> i'm not so sure about installing an earlier version after a later version. 
</s><s>on the font issue, click in some of the paragraphs and see what style is shown in the dropdown.</s><s> if they are lists it is possible the answer will be "none" and you have to apply a paragraph style as well as the list style.</s><s> i can give you more information if that is the problem.

</s><s>i have finally found some time to have another look at this.</s><s> i removed all previous copies of rh and rh templates as requested installed rh and my attempts to create help files or import existing help files is summarised here, with a more detailed log shown below. 
1.</s><s> i am experiencing problems with rh word - new or existing word files are said to be corrupt or password protected. 
2. success using rh html to import word 2010 or previous word docs 
3. partial success using rh html to import existing help, .hlp, files 
4. very limited success if at all importing more complex help files that form part of a combined set. 
5. trying to open an existing help project in rh word takes a very very long time and the os claims that the rh word is no longer responding.</s><s> there certainly does not appear to be any activity, just a status bar stating reading project source... 
a log of my attempts is listed here 

</s><s>rh installation and creation log 22/04/2011 removed rh8 and rh9 from the pc.</s><s> went to the applicationdata\microsoft\templates, i.e. %appdata%\microsoft\templates and removed all rh templates and also the two templates hpj2doc.dot and hpj2docm.dot, fearing that these may also be used by rh word. 
</s><s>tried to install rh but got the following dialog 
cid:image002.png@01cc0108.e330e3e0 clicking reinstall simply restarted the installation process but it never completed, the whole pc hung, such that you could not even load the task monitor.</s><s> re-booted pc and then successfully installed rh9.</s><s> following attempts to create help files follow: 
á after successful installation opened rh word and tried to run a very simple help file with previously created help doc and received this cid:image003.png@01cc0108.e330e3e0 
á (ii) started rh word afresh and tried to create a simple help file from scratch targeted as a chm file.</s><s> note word is displaying 3rd helpfile.docx[compatibility mode] - microsoft word in its window handle -why?</s><s>.</s><s> this worked fine see 3rd helpfile.chm.</s><s> after creation of this help file the application data\microsoft\templates directory contained this cid:image004.png@01cc0108.e330e3e0 
á (iii) started rh word afresh and tried to create a help file by importing a simple word document saved as a native word 2010 docx.</s><s> this produced the following dialog 
cid:image005.png@01cc0108.e330e3e0 and the documents topics were not imported. 
á (iv) started rh word afresh and tried to create a help file by importing a simple word document saved as a legacy word 97-2003 doc file.</s><s> this again produced the dialog á cid:image006.png@01cc0108.e330e3e0 
á (v) started rh html and tried to create a file by importing a simple word document saved as a native word 2010 docx.</s><s> imported ok as a single html file, ignoring the headings and produced a toc with just the two topics, the 1st default topic and the imported word docx.</s><s> see import_a_word_2010_doc.chm the fact that the headings have not created separate html files is probably due to my unfamiliarity with rh html. á (vi) same result when importing a word 97-2003.doc file á (vii) repeat (v) but with same word docx now containing a toc, partial success in that each topic is now defined as a bookmark in and toc transferred to rh.</s><s> would prefer the topics to stay as new topics but again this may be due to my lack of familiarity with rh html á (vii) started rh html and imported small previously created .hlp file successfully.</s><s> some minor errors but acceptable á (viii) started rh html and imported more complex previously created .hlp file .</s><s> this file's help files toc had been "hidden" so that it could be used with a combined toc that controlled several help files, i.e. in the original help files hpj file is the line cnt = combined.cnt 
cid:image009.jpg@01cc0109.1dd985b0 
</s><s>this combined.cnt file referenced the actual help files .cnt file - was this the reason for the following failure?</s><s> the importation was almost useless.</s><s> hardly any of the topics were identified and spurious bookmarks scattered throughout the document at apparently random locations

<s>first you must realise you would be working with an unsupported version of word and it is possible the macros that robohelp uses in robohelp for word might not work.</s><s> i don't mean to scaremonger as it may well work, the point is that you have to accept the downside if there is one. 
</s><s>i'm no registry expert so maybe there are different keys in different installations and maybe there are others that need editing.</s><s> i assume the path to where word is installed is correct for you.

<s>yes, this is main reason of problem.</s><s> i asked my national dept of adobe for explaining this case (i need not word while generating pdf) but did not get any reasonable explanation so i think that it is either bug in version 8 or intention - i am not able to decide what is right :-) finally, i upgraded od version 9 and all works fine.

<s>robohelp 8 was not compatible with word 2010.</s><s> hacks were put forward with mixed results. 
</s><s>when robohelp produces a pdf it does so by creating a hidden word document and then creating a pdf from that.</s><s> no compatible version of word means there is no document to generate the pdf from. 
</s><s>quite simply, you need a compatible version to get either a word document or a pdf.

<s>hi george, 
</s><s>i note the line in your original post :- 
</s><s>"note: i previously had robohelp 8 installed, but uninstalled and made sure that every occurence of robohelp.dot was gone." 
i think that is your problem.</s><s> you have deleted the robohelp.dot from the templates directory.</s><s> although you are using office 2010 or 2007 robohelp still insists on using an office 2003 or earlier format template in *.</s><s>dot format.</s><s> you need to have a robohelp.dot template for the program to work.</s><s> may i syggest a re-install, leave the robohelp.dot in place as it is instaled and see what happens ?</s><s> i posted an issue a couple of weeks ago questioning why robohelp does not use dotx or dotm format templates as per office 2010 and peter grainge has asked adobe on my behalf... yet to see a reply. 
</s><s>my issue related to potemntial incosistency in bult output (corruption) and question whether that was caused bt the different formats of the template ie:- a 2003 format templat in documents saved in 2010 or 2007 format.</s><s> as others have stated in the past word starts up in 'compatribility' mode when using the *.</s><s>dot format template that i have found may be linked to some output and build issues ?
