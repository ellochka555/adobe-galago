<s>has anyone else encountered this issue?</s><s> after updating to air 4.0.0.1390, our rh air help installers no longer work.</s><s> this includes .air help from 2 - 3 years ago, which have installed fine all these years, all the way up to a recent .air file we created for an upcoming release.</s><s> this problem occurs on both mac and win, with the us version of air and the chinese version of air, and it's a critical problem for us. now when you double-click the .air file to install the help, you get this message: "sorry, an error has occurred.</s><s> the application could not be installed because the installer file is damaged.</s><s> try obtaining a new installer file from the application author." well, the application author is us. but this isn't a problem that we can fix, because it happened with the air 4.0 update.</s><s> version 3.8 of air works fine.</s><s> version 3.9 broke our context-sensitive help on the mac (bug 3648177, filed in oct, not that it did us any good).</s><s> now version 4.0 has broken our air help completely.</s><s> we are transitioning to html5 help but not quickly enough, it seems.</s><s> can anyone confirm that the same thing happens?</s><s> thank you, alexandra

<s>here is the current status of this problem.</s><s> i am going into detail in case this helps anyone else in a similar situation.</s><s> five years ago, i created my first air help file and i used a self-signed certificate without a timestamp.</s><s> had i read peter grainge's info, i would have used a timestamp, but adobe's help says "select to include a timestamp on the digital certificate.</s><s> the timestamp provides information on how long the certificate is valid." since i thought the certificate would always be valid, i didn't know this was important.</s><s> fast forward five years.</s><s> i've created many, many .air help files in many languages, all using the same certificate that i originally created.</s><s> thousands of customers have these help files installed, and their certificates have all expired.</s><s> no one can install or reinstall these help files now.</s><s> our installer engineer worked hard to find a way to extend the certificates.</s><s> however, it appears that even though i have the latest version of air (4.0) on my system, robohelp *may* be using air 1.5 to create the .air files, even in rh 11 (this is not confirmed by adobe but in the output, the helpviewer-app.xml file indicates that this is true).</s><s> this is important, because apparently air certificates after air 1.5.3 have a grace period which allows them to be extended.</s><s> certificates from air earlier than that cannot be extended.</s><s> i can create new output with a new certificate and a timestamp (i have archives of all my help projects).</s><s> but, the new certificate and timestamp causes air to treat the updated help as if it were new help.</s><s> it won't install automatically over the old help, and our context-sensitive help is broken.our engineer tried hard to find a way to prevent the updated help with the new certificate to be treated as a new help, but he says that for older versions of air (like 1.5), the "publisher id" is not separate from the certificate.</s><s> a new publisher id is required with a new certificate.</s><s> this is a bad situation, to say the least.</s><s> vikas has tried to help but what we were able to determine is that my context-sensitive help is functioning properly.</s><s> i know this anyway, because when the engineer updates the publisher id for our software to connect to the updated help, all works as expected.</s><s> but we are not going to re-issue previous versions of our software so that the context-sensitive help functions correctly.</s><s> all customers with older help who need to reinstall it for any reason, will no longer have context-sensitive help.</s><s> i am still hoping to learn something from an adobe engineer that will help us be able to re-issue our help and have it not be viewed as a different help installation, or extend our certificates.</s><s> vikas does not have this information, though i appreciate that he tried to assist us. in my research on this, i also found one person who used a certified, signed, certificate and had it expire after five years.</s><s> and someone else who used a timestamp but still had the help expire.</s><s> on the air support site, it definitely states that self-signed certificates expire after five years - now i know this.</s><s> but not a word about this in robohelp help.</s><s> in hindsight, i am sorry that i created my help files with air.</s><s> alexandra

<subject>Update Adobe AIR help content without necessity of installation for users???</subject>
<post author="MelanieeOo" timestamp="Aug 12, 2013 9:17 AM">
<s>hello there, Ê i want to make our manuals available as adobe air help applications.</s><s> unfortunately for our users it is not possible to regularly install these applications.</s><s> therefore i decided to generate a help viewer as air file and help content as rha file ("help content only" ssl option).</s><s> so admins only once have to install an initial air file.</s><s> afterwards users are able to replace help content to update help files.</s><s> i proceeded in a similar way as described here: http://blogs.adobe.com/techcomm/2010/07/merging_multiple_helps_in_air_ help_output.html Ê in principle this is a good solution - but here is my problem: help content itself already consists of different projects (merged projects).</s><s> merged projects unfortunately cannot be generated with "help content only" ssl option. Ê anyone has got an idea how to satisfy all my conditions: - customers only once have to install an air file - afterwards help content can be updated by replacing files (without installation) - help content itself contains merged projects . Ê generate different outputs (rha files) for the merged projects is not a possibility.</s><s> the merged projects with regard to content belong to one single manual - i'm not talking about different manuals.</s><s> so users should be able to search the whole manual and so on ...</s><s>). Ê thank you so much in anticipation! Ê melanie

<s>peter, 
</s><s>i'm a little confused, but the discussion is bouncing between "merged help" (which is not an issue for me) and the airhelp installation issue.</s><s> if i may simplify the question: is it possible to create a help system in airhelp that is installed on the end user's pc only once, and which then updates automatically whenever the source files (which are housed on a web server) are modified?</s><s> i got the impression from the robohelp documentation that this is possible, but you know how thin the docs are. 
</s><s>like melanie, i really like the airhelp interface and the fact that it supports favorites, rss feeds, etc. it also has a nice print feature that lets you print the page in the current help window or the entire help system.

<s>yes i understand what an anchored button is.</s><s> i believe they will require either a div tag or some javascript and for that reason i suspect you will not be able to achieve that in air help.</s><s> not saying you cannot, simply setting an expectation.</s><s> you would need to google possible methods and then try. 
</s><s>the reason i asked what the button would do is to see if that was likely to require javascript as well.</s><s> you have only said where the button will appear, not what it will do when clicked.</s><s> if it is a back to top, then if you can find a way of anchoring the button, then applying a link where the url is a hashtag would give you back to top. 
</s><s>overall though, i think the biggest challenge is getting javascript to work in air help.

<s>hi peter 
</s><s>i'm not sure if this requires a new discussion / thread.</s><s> i am receiving the same error (error: failed to initialize database) but i believe i am creating a slightly different output than geoffdma.</s><s> i am using robohelp 10's help viewer wizard to create an empty adobe air file that is used to access individual help systems generated using the adobe air help content only output type (*.rha) which are referenced through a helpcfg.cfg file. 
</s><s>therefore, i believe this is different from the merged help system geoffdma is referencing and more appropriately may be considered a "combined help" system.</s><s> i use this method since i work in a corporate environment and so that it only has to perform a one-time installation of the initial air file generated through the help viewer wizard and place the .cfg file.</s><s> i can then continuously update/change the individual "help content only" .rha files and the users can replace these without requiring administrator privileges) 
</s><s>anyway, as for the search - it will in fact work correctly if the individual help systems are generated using the robohelp "adobe air application" output type and the utilized as standalone applications.</s><s> it is only when i change the output type to "help content only" and view the combined files through the help viewer wizard air file i have created that i receive the "error: failed to initialize database" message

<s>browser based air help does not have commenting, whether or not you have robohelp server. 
</s><s>you need to consider either webhelp or, if you have robohelp 10, a desktop layout in the multiscreen html5 layouts.

</s><s>in time though it may be that your customers will need to access parts of your software from a phone.</s><s> it will be easy for you to change your output from webhelp to multiscreen to cover that but there's one little catch.</s><s> your developers would need to change all the calls to the help for that reason you might want to discuss this with them before you commit.

<s>welcome to the forum josh. 
</s><s>good question.</s><s> when air help was introduced, support was for windows, mac and linux.</s><s> air help is an application developed using the air technology and it relies on the air runtime.</s><s> support for the air runtime linux stopped at the 2.6 version of the runtime but air help can still be run on all three platforms, subject to that limitation for linux. 
</s><s>looking now at adobe's site there is reference to air applications being deployed on newer platforms such as android.</s><s> i suspect though that such air apps would have to be built using later versions of the air sdk than were available to the robohelp developers when they produced air help.</s><s> to the best of my knowledge, it has not been modified to work on android or similar systems. 
i will try to find out more and will post back with what i find.

<s>my publishing workflow for browser-based air help has performed flawlessly until recently.</s><s> i now receive publishing failure notices (as pictured below) without exception.</s><s> up until december 15th (when i made my last update), i have never encountered any problems.</s><s> i have made no overt changes to my computer configuration.</s><s> i am of the opinion that this issue is specific to robohelp as i am still able to successfully utilize the exact same destination and server information to upload content in both dreamweaver and filezilla without any issues.</s><s> i have tried to remedy this using robohelp version 8 and robohelp version 9 on a second computer as well.</s><s> hostgator tech support (which is excellent by the way) states that the information i am using is accurate.

<s>i think some of the "should" be put on the instruction from adobe (and me).</s><s> we host many apps on our website, so if there are any specific intricacies to hosting browser-based air help, its up to me, adobe, and resources i can access like this community board to figure it out. :/

i will continue to play with the other options in the air output screens, like "specify the url for online help," but the instructions on peter's site say that this is only used when generating "air application and browser based help" as the output type.</s><s> (i am only trying to generate "browser based help."

<s>hi there 
just a comment about something i'm seeing that is a very hazardous practice depicted in your screen captures. 
i see what i'm assuming to be the "test webhelp", but in the "output folder and start page" field, i note you appear to be pointing to \\csg... and that would appear to me that you are specifying the ultimate destination where things will end up after publishing. 
</s><s>note that generating and publishing are two completely different processes.</s><s> again, perhaps this was a one off just to test things.</s><s> but if you are actually working this way, be prepared for lots of issues.</s><s> one of the first things that happens is that robohep attempts to delete all the files in the output folder before it creates the new set of files.</s><s> if you are pointing to the final upload location, you could see issues as robohelp attempts to delete the files and "pulls the rug" out from beneath the users that may be accessing them at the time. 
</s><s>some folks think they are being clever and saving a step or two by working this way, but in fact, they are causing themselves grief down the road.

<s>hello, 
</s><s>we're using robohelp software to create our help files.</s><s> the output is generated as .air file. 
</s><s>for deployment we're using installshield basic msi projects. 
</s><s>in order to include the help files we have 2 options: 
1.</s><s> include the .air file in the is msi and run the adobeair installer (silent, eventually) to install the air files.</s><s> 2. include the expanded (installed somewhere and copied) help files / folders in the is msi and just copy them on the target machine.</s><s> the expanded air files/folder do not require any other registration, etc, in order ru be used.

<subject>Twisties (and ShowHideAll) methods supported in AIR output?</subject>
<post author="MichaelHeff" timestamp="Feb 18, 2010 9:26 AM">
<s>just wondering... 
</s><s>does anyone know of a way to produce working twisties-with-showhideall controls that work in air applications produced from robo 8? 
</s><s>peter grainge's web site (http://www.grainge.org/pages/authoring/twisty/twisty.htm) provides excellent information about implementing a variety of twisty methods for webhelp output that displays well in internet explorer, firefox, and google chrome. 
</s><s>currrently we use the "twisties with a one-button showhideall" implentation that works great in webhelp format.</s><s> unfortunately, this method uses the "original" twisty method with a single-button showhide script - neither of which currently works in air output. 
</s><s>there is another twisty method (ts paul's) that works fine in air, but cannot be combined with showhideall button functionality. 
</s><s>robohtml 8 does provide a fairly crude, built-in method for implementing twisties that is supported through the default rh webhelp javascript file: ehlpdhtm.js.</s><s> however, this method only supports a single twisty implementation per help project, and it doesn't support any showhideall controls. 
</s><s>does anyone know a way around this limitation, that would allow including twisties-with-showhideall functionality in robohtml so that it is viewable in air format?

</s><s>for testing purposes, the software is installed on my machine, so the address for the software itself would be localhost.</s><s> this is the address for the help: http://localhost/mysoftware/help/startpage.htm#topic1.htm>>cap=...>>pan=2>>pbs=toc|ndx|nls|gls|custom_30065 (but i don't know what this part ">>cap=..." stands for). 
</s><s>then, we have the bsscdefault.h for assigning the topics to the software - everything works fine here.</s><s> the help itself is called by using robohelp_csh.js.</s><s> the original file has been slightly modified for web help pro.</s><s> i suppose, that i will need to modify the robohelp_csh.js for implementing air help, but i don't have a clue, how this is done.</s><s> the source code in the software looks like this: 
...</s><s> <script src="..." type="text/javascript"></script><script src=".../scripts/robohelp_csh.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script language="javascript"> function showmyhelp(mapid, command) { rh_showmyhelp(0, '/mysoftware/help/topic1.htm>twopane', command, mapid); if (event != null) { event.cancelbubble = true; event.returnvalue = false; } } function showpagehelp() { showmyhelp(5, hh_help_context); } 
function showhelp() { var mpmain = document.getelementbyid('mpmain'); if(mpmain != null){ var iframe = mpmain.getpage(mpmain.selectedindex).getelementsbytagname('iframe')[0 ]; var myiframe = eval(iframe.id); myiframe.showpagehelp(); } else{ showpagehelp(); } } ...</s><s> </script> 
</s><s>the thing is, that on friday the browser based air help worked for firefox, but not for ie. today, both of them won't work.</s><s> but this might also be a cache problem.</s><s> if i call the context sensitive help using bb air help, nothing happens. 
</s><s>any idea? 
</s><s>thanks, steffi

<s>hi, steffi 
</s><s>caution: i certainly don't want to confuse matters more.</s><s> if you are confident robohelp server is not in the picture, please ignore this!</s><s> my only purpose here is to help you solve part of the lingering mystery of whether you are running a version of robohelp server or not.</s><s> this is important, because as rick and peter have said, webhelp pro is only valid if you are publishing your project to a web server that has the "roboengine" or "robohelp server" installed on it. 
</s><s>since you are inheriting an older project and some of your predecessors are no longer around, here is a way to diagnose if a robohelp server is involved: 
here is a typical url for adobe robohelp server 8 or 9: http://localhost:8080/robohelp/server?prj=mysoftwarehelp&ctxid=10 
the port :8080 along with the "/robohelp/server" string is what you would expect in most default situations.</s><s> (the ctxid=10 is how the context sensitive help topic (with the mapid of 10) is called from the web application.</s><s>) 
</s><s>another possibility is that your web server is running an ancient version of "roboengine".</s><s> this is over 10 years old and the name roboengine was named by ehelp and macromedia.</s><s> when adobe bought robohelp, they completely rewrote the application and it is now called robohelp server. 
</s><s>to determine if your web server is running the old roboengine, the url would look something like this: http://domainname.com/roboapi.asp?project=mysoftwarehelp&context=101 
the biggest clue that you are running the old roboengine, is the string, roboapi.asp. 
</s><s>because the previous author and the developer are no longer around, i would say you need to holler, "time out!" and have a chat with the both the current developer and the web administrator to nail down exactly what environment you're being asked to support.</s><s> only then, can you choose the single source layout output that is appropriate as rick and peter have mentioned.

</s><s>i'll have to leave it to peter or another to address merging with air.</s><s> i've not done that myself and i'm not sure it's possible to make it work like a merged chm or webhelp will. 
</s><s>karen, i'm a bit confused by your mention of "inserting a chm reference in the toc".</s><s> can you expound on that please? 
</s><s>i'm confused because when you create a merged chm set, that's precisely how you define the child reference.</s><s> by inserting it into the toc of its parent.</s><s> then at runtime, assuming the files can be found, the end user is none the wiser they are using multiple chm files.</s><s> from their standpoint, assuming things are working, they believe they are interacting with a single chm. 
</s><s>there are a few benefits of merging.</s><s> one is that you have an ability to break things into smaller chunks.</s><s> that makes them simpler to manage.</s><s> another is control.</s><s> you are able to better control who sees what.</s><s> for example, say your company produces a product that exists as ten different modules.</s><s> the customer may mix and match modules as they wish.</s><s> so customer a may have modules one, three and five while customer b may have modules three four and seven.</s><s> so your installer could provide help for only the installed products by including only the installed modules.

<s>hello again 
okay, trying to dispel a bit of confusion with build tags and the like. 
</s><s>consider robohelp to be much like your kitchen.</s><s> it contains all the ingredients and tools to create any dish you like.</s><s> for example, you might make a complete meal.</s><s> or you might create a batch of chocolate chip cookies.</s><s> all of it occurs in the kitchen. 
</s><s>creating a merge is similar to preparing a buffet.</s><s> so the main project is like creating the buffet table.</s><s> and this buffet table may contain any number of components that you choose.</s><s> so when you design the buffet table, you create spaces for the green beans.</s><s> the potatoes.</s><s> the macaroni and cheese.</s><s> the beef.</s><s> the turkey.</s><s> the chicken.</s><s> all those items aren't exactly present in the buffet, right?</s><s> you have to create them later. 
</s><s>so you have another project that is used only to create the green beans that will be on the buffet.</s><s> and another that will create only the potatoes.</s><s> each smaller component is a project of its own.</s><s> but because the buffet table has a space for it, it will present it if you create it.</s><s> that's what a merge is like.</s><s> you are able to add and subtract different elements after the fact and the end consumer is none the wiser.</s><s> for example, if you remove potatoes and supply sweet potatoes instead, the next person visiting the buffet has no idea that potatoes were there before.</s><s> or they could be removed entirely with the same result. 
</s><s>conditional build tags are used during the preparation of any final dish you prepare.</s><s> for example, perhaps you are making chocolate chip cookies and your recipe calls for walnuts to be part of it.</s><s> you have an ability to say, for this recipe, uncle john is allergic to walnuts.</s><s> so when i make this batch, leave the walnuts out.</s><s> you applied a condition to making that recipe.</s><s> same goes with robohelp.</s><s> you tag what you wish to control.</s><s> then when you prepare using the recipe (single source layout is the recipe here) the conditional build expression handles stripping out what you wish to leave behind.</s><s> so if that's a chm file, it's going to be missing the tagged content.</s><s> if it's webhelp, the information isn't in the output files.</s><s> if it's airhelp, the information isn't in the install package. 
</s><s>does that make better sense?</s><s> i hope so...</s><s> rick

a help output that links opens another help output is not merged help just by virtue of that link.</s><s> without being set up as merged help, the search will be limited to whichever output is being referenced at the time.</s><s> if set up as merged help then if the help is opened via the parent project, then the search will cover all the child projects first.</s><s> as rick has pointed out, only merged webhelp or flashhelp require the redirect.

<s>i recently used content categories to implement a type of "restricted search." that is, i set up a content category for each of the books (ie., software modules) in my project.</s><s> that way, a user can just select a certain category/module and search for software functions in just that module.</s><s> my project is very large, so doing a generic search for "print" would yield print functionalilty across our entire software offering.</s><s> now, users can efficiently find a "print" function just within the module of interest.

<s>hi everybody, 
i like very much the outlook and the speed of an airhelp, however there are some concerns in my company regarding this type of help, and it would be awesome if i would get those dissipated.</s><s> first, there is the concern about the help trying to access the internet.</s><s> we have a lot of customers, who due to their security setting in their company do not have access to the internet.</s><s> therefore, my question would be: is it possible to use the airhelp locally (on a local workstation or on a server), somehow similar to the chm files?</s><s> second, there is a concern about the size.</s><s> is it possible to generate a single file that can be opened somehow the same way as we do with a chm file or a documentation file?</s><s> at some point as i was testing the airhelp, i found out that in order to be able to view it, one has to download air from adobe.</s><s> is it possible to distribute the air, or they just have to download the air themselves from the adobe web site, the same way it is done with acrobat reader?

<s>yes, there is a locally-installed flavour of airhelp - the file is a .air file that gets installed on the workstation.</s><s> size can be a problem because the single .air file gets unpacked into (basically) a full webhelp installation on the workstation.</s><s> the .air file you create in rh is installed using the free air runtime.</s><s> you can apply to adobe for a license to re-distribute and package it with your own custom installer (that's the way my company does it with our .</s><s>net product).

<s>using air as your primary output, you can either choose to output your help file as 
i) air application file 
ii) browser based help 
air application file would install like any other application on your machine and this would not require any internet connection.</s><s> however, as you pointed out in your second question, this would require you (or the users you are trying to distribute to) to have air (adobe integrated runtime) downloaded from adobe's website in order to view the help file.</s><s> the runtime setup is not as big as adobe reader and should not take much of space. 
</s><s>browser based help too can be used to view the help offline.</s><s> the output in this case would be a bunch of files, the starting point of which would be index.html.</s><s> this html file would load a flex based output (swf file) and you would need flash player in your web browser to view the help file.

<s>hi peter, 
</s><s>i understand that the pdf is pretty much outdated, however i understood that there are still customers who prefer to print physically the documentation and read it or just read it as a pdf document.</s><s> a pdf is also very portable and does not take too much space.</s><s> also, it is very fast through its toc when it comes to accessing different topics.</s><s> from what i saw till now, and i must admit that i did not see to much yet, as i could not experiment too much due to time issues, from the air help is that it looks much nicer then the pdf and the chm.</s><s> it is also very fast.</s><s> however, right now, these are not too much as arguments in favour of keeping the robohelp as authoring tool in our company, and i was looking for more interesting features that air might offer in comparison to other solutions.</s><s> so, to reiterate again the main points that are of importance to us right now for a help solution would be: - size that it will take in the setup file: due to distribution - it has to be standalone and installable/accessible on the network - something else which would make it stand out compared to the pdf that we are employing for the time being if i could get something definitely superior to just pdf from the points of view above, then i would be able to keep robohelp in our company.

<s>hi jeff 
</s><s>i disagree with your assessment that one should look to the help for robohelp to see an example of what can be created with robohelp.</s><s> oddly, what you see when you open robohelp's own help cannot be produced with robohelp.</s><s> it's something adobe created that is called "community help".</s><s> so it's similar, but isn't what you get with robohelp. 
</s><s>as an aside, i constantly find myself scratching and being puzzled when folks are all worried about the help looking too "dated" and wanting some new look and feel so that it's more "modern" looking. 
</s><s>i'd be willing to bet $100 against a single donut that if you seriously surveyed users, the look and feel of the help comes in dead last when compared with evaluating if the help actually did its job and was helpful.</s><s> it's sadly funny, actually.</s><s> sort of like ensuring a prison cell is painted brightly and has the latest amenities when it's the last place in the world folks typically ever want to find themselves. 
</s><s>so you find yourself jumping through hoops to ensure the help is all attractive when most folks simply refuse to open it up and would rather pick up a phone or ask their cubicle neighbor how to do something.
