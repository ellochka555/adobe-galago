</s><s>look at the info on the image above again.</s><s> when photoshop saves for the web, it downsizes everything, but the resolution is still very nice for the application.</s><s> editing at 300 dpi allows finer control of the pixels, kind of like using a finer brush when painting.</s><s> editing at 72 dpi would litterally destroy the image before you even got to use it.

<subject>RH apparently doesn't support FM text insets or other "referenced content"</subject>
<post author="SOLpubs" timestamp="Feb 5, 2014 5:07 PM">
<s>this is a new topic branching off of http://forums.adobe.com/message/6088200#6088200 
(cross-posted to frameusers, adobe robohelp "framemaker integration" forum, and robohelp bug report) 
</s><s>what follows are some important limitations regarding framemaker books that are linked via tcs 4 to a robohelp project to produce online help output (html help, webhelp, etc.</s><s>).</s><s> 
</s><s>after a fair amount of testing and research, it seems that robohelp is incompatible with *any* fm text insets or "referenced content" such as excel spreadsheets.</s><s> plus, there may be a serious limitation with cross-references in general that might require you to alter the folder structure of your fm project. 
</s><s>in several text insets in my fm book, i have cross-references to a topic outside of the inset.</s><s> in fm, the links work and everything updates/generates with no errors.</s><s> the links work in pdf.</s><s> but in the html help output from robohelp, some (but not all) of the cross references are broken--they look like links, but the cursor does not change to a pointing finger and no jump occurs when you click.</s><s> looking at the source html, the href command is missing for those particular links. 
</s><s>and although the fm "heading & page" cross-refs are set to convert to just <$paratext> in rh, some (but not all) of the broken html help links retain the "on page x" part of the fm style.</s><s> again, other cross-refs in the insets convert correctly and are active.</s><s> even within the *same inset*, some cross-refs convert correctly, and some don't. 
</s><s>an mvp replied to my inquiry on the robohelp/framemaker integration forum at the adobe community site, suggesting that i shorten the absolute paths for the target files to 35 characters or less, as he and others on the forum also had some random cross-refs that didn't work, and shortening the path seemed to clear most of them up.</s><s> i moved my "documents" and "images" folders up the tree to one level away from the drive letter.</s><s> (grudgingly, i'll admit, as it whacked my longstanding project folder structure.</s><s>) unfortunately, this didn't work; after updating in rh and generating html help, the same links were broken.</s><s> see http://forums.adobe.com/thread/1378783 this seems like another serious limitation that could cause pain if you have an established, "verbose" file/folder-naming conventions.</s><s> i'm leery of restoring my former folder structure out of the fear of breaking more cross-refs. 
</s><s>so i started digging around more in the forums and help.</s><s> here's what i found: 
- other users found that the mere presence of insets would produce the same symptoms in subsequent cross-references in a fm file.</s><s> note that these cross-refs are not in an inset, but in text following an inset.</s><s> so that seems to negate using insets at all in a fm/rh linked workflow.</s><s> see http://forums.adobe.com/thread/1137497 
- another user imported an excel spreadsheet into fm as an object.</s><s> in fm, when the excel icon is clicked, excel opens the spreadsheet.</s><s> but when linking to framemaker from robohelp to create a robohelp project, that excel icon gets pulled into rh as an image without the link to excel.</s><s> so it seems like it is more than just text insets that fail.</s><s> see http://forums.adobe.com/message/6088014#6088014#6088014 
- when i opened the help for the conversion settings dialog box in robohelp to try to solve a different cross-ref issue, i noticed the following topic tucked under the "convert framemaker cross-reference formats to robohelp styles" topic: 
</s><s>"content reference "text or files that you have inserted into the framemaker documents as content references appear as part of the topics where they are referenced.</s><s> they do not appear as references in the online help outputs." 
</s><s>it took a while to sink in, because "content reference" is not conventional fm terminology, but this vaguely-worded statement buried deep in the help seems to be saying that text insets are not supported in html help output or any other online help output.</s><s> apparently this at least includes excel spreatsheets, too.</s><s> it's also reasonably possible that it would include word docs, pdfs, or other items imported as objects.</s><s> not sure about that, as no examples of "content references" are given, but other users would probably be interested. 
</s><s>understand that i'm just trying to share what the problems are, share what i tried, and provide an aggregation of what i learned.</s><s> this info was not forthcoming or obvious when i was shopping tools.</s><s> hopefully this might help someone else with their decision making when selecting tools. 
</s><s>in fact, i'd be overjoyed to be wrong about all of this.</s><s> text insets are such a useful feature in a single-source workflow, especially if the software you are documenting uses the same widget in multiple modules, has common ui elements in both client and server dashboards, not to mention all of the re-used boilerplate legal/marketing/licensing text, etc.--the list goes on and on.</s><s> the "edit once, update many" model is too efficient for the tcs development team to just overlook.</s><s> in one of the forum threads, another commenter said he designs around this, avoiding insets.</s><s> but that saddles you with a potentially big maintenance burden at editing time, and makes it necessary to add some "comment" conditional reminder: "this text is repeated in x, y, and z. if you edit here, edit there, too." not fun, and prone to mistakes. 
</s><s>though there may be workarounds to some of these problems, none are as good as making insets work in robohelp. 
</s><s>is any of this fixed in tcs 5?</s><s> if so, i'd think it unfair to pay for an upgrade to get the fix. 
</s><s>i'm filing a bug report with adobe, not a feature request, as these issues involve the core competency of tcs with regard to single sourcing, and require budensome workarounds for stuff that should just work right out of the box. 
</s><s>thanks.</s><s>

<s>summary this issue was resolved. 
</s><s>it seems to have been a registry corruption on my machine due to a windows update restart that occurred when the help project and framemaker project were open. 
</s><s>the main symptom was that robohelp could no longer update the project from the framemaker files and was spawning a new instance of fm with each retry, even if fm was already open.

<s>i searched in this forum on "images" and within the first 60 listings found one relevant listing named "image conversion settings".from 2011. 
</s><s>if i understand the discussion, i did learn a couple things: 
1) "do not regenerate images" seems to mean that if you are re-importing framemaker files, you can avoid re-regenerating the images that were regenerated from a previous import, so i had wrong idea there. 
2) if i do not want to use re-imaged images, the work around is to do the import to robohelp and then replace the images using the source image files from the framemaker project. 
</s><s>one problem with option 2 is that i find in some cases (reason unknown) the images get renamed where frame or robohelp adds an extension to the file name like changing "image.jpg" to "image001.jpg." during the robohelp import conversion.</s><s> in this case, the work around does not help.

</s><s>initially, the undefined variable is a global (defined at the top of the file before any functions)

<s>while the idea of reusing your fm formatting seems a modest proposal (yes, intentional reference), there's too little correlation between formatting for page and for web.</s><s> as a result i suggest mapping each para style to a specific css entry (using file > project settings > import) whether you use automap or not. 
i find automap to be of little use, but the "lifting" of the fm formatting for use in the css is the #1 issue i resolve for clients. 
</s><s>bottom line: if you want control over html files, you need to understand how they're formatted.</s><s> mapping the content to rh is actually not tough; it's the formatting of the content (because of its html nature, not its fm roots) that drives folks used to print formatting crazy. 
</s><s>fwiw, i do often use an fm template when converting files, but only after i've done what i can via css.</s><s> an example: aligning graphics for pdf, i often center images on column.</s><s> because i generally left-align graphics in html, i use an object style (center-align in my print template) to control alignment for pdf, and have redefined that style to be left-aligned in my rh conversion template. 
</s><s>in other words, i don't automatically use the template option, but reserve it for things i can't otherwise control.</s><s> and i don't see anything in items discussed thus far that would warrant the template.</s><s> right now it'd probably just add to the number of potential gotchas.

Ê step 1:ÊÊ select file > import > framemaker document. Ê this brings up an "import file" dialog allowing me to chose a framemaker document (i'm kinda wondering where we're going with this, as my fm document is already linked into my rh project...</s><s> ) Ê step 2:ÊÊ in the content settings dialog box, select convert framemaker table of contents, and browse to select the framemaker toc file.

Ê but as you say, if i do it this way, it seems to hide these rh_ styles in a place i can't see or edit, and so when it gets them wrong, i'm scuppered and have to manually go and set up styles in the main rhstylemappings.css file.

<s>i agree that the process could be better, but this is still the process we're currently presented with...and it works, when you understand the underlying logic and structures. 
</s><s>for clarity, i believe you meant fm_ styles not rh_ in your post above, yes?</s><s> and by "deprecation" did you mean denigration?</s><s> afik, adobe's not given me the power to depricate the [source] method from the product.</s><s> and yes, i do not speak fondly nor blog fondly on that [source] option

</s><s>after all, framemaker reads in word docs natively, no? 
</s><s>the point of the tcs is two-fold: integration between the products allows you to do amazing things see the fm reviewers guide (created by me, posted at http://mattrsullivan.com/2013/10/fm11rg/ which uses framemaker & dita 3d with link tables and animation video (mp4, flv with cue points) captivate processed via rh to ebook see the tcs reviewers guide posted at http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/adobe/en/products/technicalcommunicat ionsuite/pdf/tcs4_reviewers_guide.pdf see the recorded webinars i did for adobe http://mattrsullivan.com/2013/10/recordings/ competitve pricing and subscription models versus cost of individual products and upgrades 
you can do things in days with this suite that used to take more than usd5000/project to complete.</s><s> it's not entirely about producing online help.</s><s> while not even close to a "free" product, i estimate the payback for the cost of a software at less than 2 months.</s><s> since the traditional product cycle is 18 months, that's pretty easy math for me.</s><s> disclosure: since i use the maintenance contract, or software upgrade plan, my overall cost for the tcs is even lower. 
</s><s>however, on that front, the 3 main tools for outputting fm to help (rh, webworks, mif2go) all have upfront configuration and less-than-trivial learning curves. 
i choose rh because of price.</s><s> it's included with other indispensable products in the tcs suite.

<s>i'm using tcs 4 with robohelp v10.0.1.292 and framemaker v 11.</s><s> i created some dummy dita files in framemaker11 using the default choices and organized them in a ditamap to learn how to work with multiple topic levels.</s><s> my ditamap has 3 topic levels.</s><s> all 3 levels display in robohelp's project manager, however only the first 2 levels display in the automatically generated toc.</s><s> (after generating webhelp output, i can do a search and find the 3rd level content, but the 3rd level topics are not displayed in the webhelp toc either.</s><s>) 
</s><s>first graphic: 3rd level files in project manager pod match how they are arranged in fm, and where they failed to show up in the fmtoc pod. 


</s><s>second graphic: i found that i can get the 3rd level to display in the robohelp toc and in webhelp output if i click the toc pod auto-create toc icon - is this the solution or is there something i just haven't got set up yet?</s><s> if regenerating the toc in rh is the solution, how do i get the accompanying file name problems to go away, i.e. the ditamap file name now replaces the ditamap title, and worse, one of the task file names has replaced its title name. 

</s><s>thanks for any clues you can provide.

<s>robohelp 9 provides two separate functionalities for converting framemaker content.</s><s> one is "import" which is available in both point product and tcs 3 versions.</s><s> another is "link" which is available only in the tcs version. 
</s><s>during import one can import a framemaker document and apply settings(manually or through .isf file) during the process of import.</s><s> once the framemaker content is imported, it becomes a part of robohelp project and is no longer recognized as framemaker content.</s><s> any change made through .isf file does not affect the already imported content.</s><s> however, one can keep the settings saved in the form of .isf file and use them again and again whenever a new framemaker document is imported.</s><s> in other words, .isf settings should be imported through the import framemaker document wizard which appears when the framemaker document is being imported.</s><s> for details, please refer the steps mentioned above in my previous post. 
</s><s>while using the link functionality, one can keep a live link of framemaker document inside a robohelp project.</s><s> one can modify the content of framemaker document and update it in robohelp.</s><s> one can also apply the conversion settings through .isf file and update the linked content to apply the new settings.</s><s> if you are looking for such a workflow you may wish to try the "link" fuctionality of technical communication suite 3. 
</s><s>regarding the performance, in general, the performance of robohelp 9 has been much improved.</s><s> however, there is a new functionality added for importing framemaker document.</s><s> robohelp 9 now provides the conversion of images in framemaker thorough distiller thus achieving much better quality of images.</s><s> this is much more time taking as compared to the non distiller route in the earlier versions of robohelp.</s><s> if one is not much concerned about the quality of converted images, he/she can always switch back to the non distiller route by turning the particular setting off.</s><s> one can follow the following steps for doing that go to file->project settings to open "project settings" dialog go to "import" tab click "edit" button for framemaker conversion settings to open the "conversion settings" dialog.</s><s> select "image" settings on the left unselect the check box for "use distiller to generate image".</s><s> click ok and apply the settings.</s><s> import the framemaker document 
i hope that answers all the queries.
