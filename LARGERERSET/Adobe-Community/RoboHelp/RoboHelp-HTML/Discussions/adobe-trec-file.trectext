<subject>Bug? Renaming of conditional tags not changed in snippets (RH9)</subject>
<post author="Erwin Timmerman" timestamp="Mar 19, 2013 4:23 AM">
<s>if i rename a conditional build tag (cbt), these changes are copied into the htm files.</s><s> however, the cbts are not changed in hts files (the snippets). 
</s><s>can anyone else reproduce this?</s><s> was it fixed in rh10? 
</s><s>if not, i can file a bug report.</s><s> (or should this be considered a feature?</s><s> ) 
</s><s>regardless of whether or not you would want to insert conditions in snippets, if you can, the changes should be carried through into snippets as well imo. 
</s><s>how i found out: 
i have a cbt called tbd, which is excluded during build.</s><s> in this tag, i put questions or remarks such as "add link to..." to make sure any unaddressed questions never show up in the final build, they are excluded using this tag. 
</s><s>to make the tag more specific and less prone to show up in text searches that were not specificly aimed at this tag, i renamed it to _t_b_d_. 
</s><s>when i subsequently opened a snippet, it showed me a tag color i did not set.</s><s> and lo and behold, the condition was still tbd.

<s>is this the time when i get really angry at adobe for creating the worst framemaker/robohelp integration ever?</s><s> no!</s><s> however, i must admit that i'm amazed that they are unable to solve an important feature as conversion of lists from a framemaker document to a robohelp webhelp project.</s><s> when i say conversion i mean a clean conversion with minimal interference from robohelp that allows me to use css to its full extent. Ê here's the problem, and this was also the problem with robohelp 7 and framemaker 8.</s><s> btw, i use standalone versions (not tcs 1 or 2).</s><s> figures: first image depicts framemaker 9's paragraph designer and the autonumber format for a paragraph named viznumbered.</s><s> second image depicts the robohelp 8's conversion setting. Ê framemaker uses autonumbering in front of paragraphs to create lists.</s><s> this means that you in robohelp need to manage two formats, the autonumber and the paragraph style.</s><s> robohelp does of course not (by default) use autonumbering in front of paragraphs because a robohelp webhelp project is html based, and list tags in html can perfectly handle any formatting of text etc. Ê robohelp will convert, when "convert autonumber to html list" is selected, the autonumber in framemaker to a list tag (li).</s><s> by default this will generate a list with a lot of margin, font and other css properties that tries to simulate the way the list is laid out in the framemaker document.</s><s> in addition to the list tags it will convert the framemaker paragraph to a p tag which it inserts within a list tag.</s><s> the issue you will experience with this is that indentations with the paragraph tag does not align properly between line 1 and 2.</s><s> at the same time the webhelp project will not look the same in ie, firefox or chrome.</s><s> that is, chrome and firefox will look the same, and ie different.</s><s> ie has the wysiwyg feel, but it does not comply well with w3c standards (i.e. using p tags enclosed by li tags is not a good idea ...</s><s>). Ê selecting "convert autonumber to robohelp list" does something similar, but is not recommended at all! Ê so, here's the big question.</s><s> how can i make sure robohelp understands that i only need to define a list tag with a css class attribute attached to it? Ê today i basically only get the following: <li><p class=""></p></li> or, <p class=""></p> Ê what i want is the following: <li class=""></li> Ê can this be solved with today's versions, can anyone help me, or do i have to wait for the adobe development team to realize this and to fix it?

<s>i cannot comment on the conversion process but may be able to suggest a post conversion solution.</s><s> i am assuming you have tested and that if you manually change one of the files to <li class="yourstylename"> it does give the correct results in the robohelp design editor. 
</s><s>try this on a copy of your project. 
</s><s>using a multi-file find and replace tool such as far, you could search all files for <li><p class="yourstylename"> and replace with <li class="yourstylename"> that one is straightforward because the closing <li> tag exists 
the <p class="yourstylename"> change is more tricky precisely because the closing </li> tag does not exist and robohelp does not autocorrect that at the end of the item.</s><s> that leaves only one solution that i can see and that is the use of regular expressions.</s><s> basically you would create an expression, think of it as a mathematical formula but designed to find text strings.</s><s> the formula would search for <p class="yourstylename">text that would be different in every item</p> and replace it with <li class="yourstylename">text that would be different in every item</li> 
i am not saying that it is simple but it should work using tools such as far and powergrep.</s><s> it might also be that there is a way of doing the conversion that avoids the problem but, as i said, i cannot help you there. 
</s><s>far is low cost and has a long trial so that you can see how it works. http://www.helpware.net/far 
powergrep is a bit more expensive but there is also a free trial. http://www.powergrep.com/ 
i have used both and they are good tools.</s><s> i am not an expert in the use of regular expressions, i just sort of hack away until what i want works but that has often saved me days of work.</s><s> i think i would be able to help you write this one if need be.

<s>hi gina, i totally understand your frustration.</s><s> after much trial and error (including trying the magnifier, too!</s><s>), my it team and i gave up and there are no settings that correct this problem.</s><s> that being said, i did find some windows settings that improve the appearance in some respects that i'm happy to share with you.</s><s> my appearance is also dictated by my need to capture screenshots. 
i have two monitors, dell1907fp, dell p190s 1280x1024 resolution 
screen resolution: 125%, custom dpi 9pt, select xp scaling option, turn on cleartype text, - because if i go larger, other things dont display correctly.</s><s> selecting large icons in robohelp didn't really help me so i left them set to default size even tho that's tiny. 
</s><s>my eyes do get tired more easily now so i try to give them more breaks and i moved my screen stands up as close as possible - they are somewhat hanging off my desk.</s><s> don't forget that you can change the view size of your topic but the problem i found with that is then the horizontal scroll bar kicks in and i find that cumbersome.</s><s> i'm hoping the robohelp developers eventually give us the same setting options as microsoft does in outlook - i've gotten rid of the 6pt font in 95% of outlook.</s><s> my eye doctor says i don't need glasses for the computer.</s><s> i am just one of those people that can't tolerate the tiny font size for long periods of time.

<s>hi there 
your use of "the vault" would seem to most certainly describe some form of a source control system.</s><s> source control systems offer a combination between a librarian and a traffic cop.</s><s> typically you log into these systems with a user id and a password.</s><s> that way the system knows who you are. 
</s><s>typically with these systems the data resides on a coroporate network.</s><s> and also typically you will have a "working folder" on your hard drive where the files exist.</s><s> when everything is checked into the source control system, the files on your hard drive are flagged as "read only". 
</s><s>when you need to work with a file, you perform a process of checking out.</s><s> the source control system then changes the read only status of the file on your hard drive to read/write.</s><s> but it also makes a note of the date/time stamp.</s><s> if the file stored in source control is newer than the counterpart on your hard drive, it copies the newer file to your hard drive before allowing you to make changes. 
</s><s>i'd begin with a simple sanity check.</s><s> create a totally separate and new project.</s><s> add a topic or three.</s><s> add an image.</s><s> generate.</s><s> do things work okay?</s><s> if not, you have some form of issue with robohelp that needs to be resolved before you attempt to troubleshoot what is happening with your project in source control. 
</s><s>perhaps try copying the content from source control to a different folder and see if you are then able to make edits. 
</s><s>hopefully something here either helped directly or sparked a thought that does.

<s>hi there 
i believe you are sort of running into an issue with style sheets.</s><s> when you bring word documents into robohelp, they typically have a css file created based on the word styling.</s><s> the master page likely has its own css and that is probably overriding the css your word document created. 
i think the "fix" here is to carefully make adjustments to the css that is associated with your master page so the styles in it reflect what you hope to see from your word document.

<s>hi there 
personally, i've never understood why even toc entries were hyperlinked.</s><s> why?</s><s> well, it's quite simple.</s><s> the word output from robohelp is really intended for printing.</s><s> and there is no such thing as a hyperlink on a printed sheet of paper. 
</s><s>if you want to use the word document as you would use webhelp or other on-line output, why even consider using an expensive product like robohelp?

<s>as someone else said - this functionality doesn't exist in word so it is highly unlikely that you can get robohelp to create this.</s><s> if it is a showstopper, once you generate the pdf, you can manually create the links in acrobat.</s><s> i did that once for a client who really wanted the index linked...until after a few versions, i showed him that even word didn't link it so he finally let that go. 
</s><s>sorry - i can't think of a way to do this automatically other than creating a topic called "index" in rh and manually creating the linked version of the index there and treating it as a separate topic.</s><s> the advantage to doing this is that it is much easier to do in rh than in word; the disadvantage is it would still take time and would have to be manually maintained in the future (i.e....cute idea, but a documentation nightmare).

<post author="JustinAshley" timestamp="Mar 6, 2014 12:28 PM">
<s>robohelp 7 html version 7.03.001 generating in flash help 
</s><s>i would like to start by providing a little background.</s><s> we have built many large projects in robohelp 6 over the years.</s><s> we recently needed to upgrade to robohelp 7.</s><s> in doing so, i have converted all projects to the new version. 
</s><s>previously, in robohelp 6, if i needed to create a new topic i could either simply right click and create new topic or even duplicate an existing topic and edit the new instance.</s><s> i would use the default style sheet and template when creating or duplicating.</s><s> this would create a topic page that was fully customizable (e.g., did not require a header, body, etc.</s><s>).</s><s> i could then drag the topic to create links to the page or even as pop ups.</s><s> this worked flawlessly and was very user friendly! 
</s><s>in robohelp 7, i went to create a new topic with the intention of using it as a pop up and link to it on an existing page.</s><s> each new page i create, even when no template is selected and is using the default style sheet, i am forced to use a field which auto-fills the title of the pop up and then the body.</s><s> it is not a freeform page as before.</s><s> if i attempt to remove the field or duplicate off an existing topic, edit the new page, and then link to it, it displays the text from the old topic.</s><s> i can't even see my edits.</s><s> it is like i linked to what i duplicated from, which is not the case.</s><s> these issues seem to either be using the style sheet to override my edits (even though the page looks fine) or when i duplicate from a topic it makes the old content the style sheet for the new page, regardless of what information i put on the new page. 
</s><s>in short, i am not able to create new topics that are freeform.</s><s> this leaves me with two questions: is there a way to disable templates and style sheets so that i can simply make a new topic that has no restrictions on formatting?</s><s> is there a reason that when i duplicate from an existing topic and edit the newly created page that when i link to the new page it displays the other pages content?

i would just like to know if you can provide me information on these questions: 
with only one css in my online help (default.css), how come i can't change/add a style in the css and have it apply to the content?</s><s> is there an intermediary step?</s><s> i have, for ex, created a new style in the css called bodytext with 12pt arial, double line spacing.</s><s> i then highlight the text in the content i want to have that style, then double click on bodytext in the style and formatting pane.</s><s> it does not work.</s><s> what i have to do is manually change the style of the text in the design editor every time.</s><s> when inserting my png files, why does robohelp display them at a much smaller size in the browser (ie10)?

4. run printdocext macro however, i then performed the following:

<s>hello guys, i have a problem with importing word-documents to rh11.</s><s> it is not a problem with the process itself, but with the settings.</s><s> after importing the documents to rh11 the image quality is absolutly messed up.</s><s> the resolution is not even half of the original and its blurry.</s><s> it seems to be that rh11 only takes a "screenshot" of the picture within the word document instead of importing the original high quality image.</s><s> i am generating a manual and therefor im going to export the project as webhelp pro.</s><s> my inconvinient solution is to export the high quality images from the word document manually and replace the messy pictures in the webhelppro folders.</s><s> as you can imagin this is going to take a lot of time and resources while the project is getting bigger.</s><s> hopefully you can help me.</s><s> best regards from germany and please pardon my english :-)

<subject>FPJ files not updating upon topic import</subject>
<post author="Rocky_XYZZY" timestamp="Mar 3, 2014 11:51 AM">
<s>hi, gang!</s><s> 
</s><s>we have a large project file that's been maintained seeming forever.</s><s> it's probably nearly 8 years old and has been upgraded through four or five versions of robohelp.</s><s> to take advantage of some downtime in between versions, we decided to create a fresh project and import all of the content from the age-old project file into a new, pristine project file.</s><s> very briefly, the process was: 
create a new project and define a folder hierarchy in the project manager to match the original project.</s><s> that is, create empty directories in the proper hierarchy for the project.</s><s> import one folder at a time, beginning with the lowest levels of each branch and working through the project. 
</s><s>this worked really well except for about 30 broken links.</s><s> further investigation refvealed that the broken links were caused by files that imported but did not show up in the project manager because the fpj files didn't update. 
i can manually import the missing files and one-by-one, the broken links disappear.</s><s> but, because the fpj files aren't updating (verified by watching the fpj file for a given directory as i reimport files), the problem topics and resultant broken links reappear when i reopen the project. 
</s><s>by doing this repeatedly, i can occassionally get one or two fpj files to update, slightly changing the number of topics that are missing.</s><s> but i can't get rid of them all. 
</s><s>i've tried opening the project using the hhp file instead and letting the project rebuild, but that doesn't help. 
</s><s>i've tried resetting the properties of the project directory to ensure that nothing is read-only, but that doesn't help. 
</s><s>i've tried deleting just th fpj files in the problem directories and reimporting but that doesn't help.</s><s> it creates a new fpj file but it has no topics listed, no matter how many times i try to import. 
</s><s>so, here i sit with a project that's 90% there, were it not for the missing 10% of files that refuse to "stick" because when i import them the fpj files don't update. 
(i'm running version 10 and am wondering if version 11 would maybe solve my problem.</s><s>) 
</s><s>any advice? 
</s><s>thanks!</s><s> 
------later that same day------- 
if i manually edit the fpj file for every offending directory and paste into it the content from the well behaved fpj files in the original project, the topics stay after project relaunch and the broken links stay resolved.</s><s> the next step is to see if newly added topics are retained or if, once again, the fpj files are static and refuse to update.

<s>if you want my opinion, forget about manual importing.</s><s> i normally just place all topics i want in the directories of the target project and then fix the fpj files.</s><s> much faster than importing one by one.</s><s> you just need to make sure to patch all the links to images, style sheets and the like in the target project.</s><s> but that only applies if you change the structure of the project. 
</s><s>you can also copy the information for context sensitivity this way.

<s>hi there- 
i resolved it by taking a look at the backups i had in carbonite.</s><s> i found a relatively recent version of the master map file and then copied it over to the project folder, which solved my problem.</s><s> if there's some other solution that involves doing scripting or digging in rh, i don't know anything about it - sorry! 
</s><s>maybe try asking william (his post is a few above this one) for help?</s><s> he seemed to have a good idea and may be able to guide you.
