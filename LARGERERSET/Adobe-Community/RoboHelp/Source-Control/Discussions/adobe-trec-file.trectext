<subject>Tutorial on RoboSource Control?</subject>
<post author="Ajay367" timestamp="Mar 20, 2014 10:03 AM">
<s>hi, 
</s><s>where can i find a good tutorial/manual on robosource control?</s><s> the help included with the source control is pretty cryptic to say the least. 
i managed to install robosource control, and my team has been using it all these years.</s><s> but i've never delved into the more powerful features like pinning, tagging, branching, whatnot.</s><s> as our team consists of multiple writers working on the same project, the source control works transparently, enabling us to complete our task, but i've been rather scared of doing anything more than that. 
</s><s>the help doesn't say much.</s><s> nor does google. 
</s><s>any help, pointers would be greatly appreciated. 
</s><s>thanks, ajay

<subject>Perforce and .xpj files</subject>
<post author="Mat D" timestamp="Mar 20, 2014 9:14 AM">
<s>i've setup a couple of robohelp projects in perforce using this guide: http://www.adobe.com/devnet/robohelp/articles/perforce-integration.htm l 
</s><s>everything is working fine, aside from the .xpj file from robohelp (that contains the source control connection details) also syncs with the perforce server, and if multiple users connect to the project, it does not save each user's details to the .xpj file. 
</s><s>excluding the .xpj file from syncing with perforce means that when you first pull the files down from perforce, you cannot open the project (as there is no .xpj to open!</s><s>).</s><s> if you don't exclude it, you can open the project once with your perforce login details, but next time you open the project in robohelp, it asks you to login with the users details that first added the project to perforce. 
</s><s>anyone any ideas?</s><s> and i hope i explained that clearly enough

<s>robohelp 10 stops working every time when i open a checked in topic and make a change forcing the topic to be checked out automatically.</s><s> this worked perfectly in all previous versions of robohelp.</s><s> after restarting the program, the desired topic is checked out.</s><s> checking topics out manually before editing works without a crash.

<s>update on this problem, the problem exists when the internet and internal network are slow.</s><s> i think there is some timeout either in windows or robohelp that throws this stopped working error.

<subject>Shared Location when using RoboSource Control</subject>
<post author="Jop Smith" timestamp="Nov 5, 2013 5:24 AM">
<s>rh10 | webhelp 
</s><s>we've recently implemented robosource control with rh10 and have a multi-author environment.</s><s> does anyone know if it's possible to maintain a shared location of common resources, e.g. style sheet, etc?</s><s> i've always used robohelp's shared locaton feature when i've worked independently, but now we're working as a team it's more difficult. 
</s><s>we've tried creating a shared location on the network, but this impacted the performance of robohelp as we are remote workers.</s><s> we've also tried pointing to a shared location locally on our laptops, but each time files are checked in it updates rhsharedresource.apj.</s><s> for example, user a sets the shared location to c:\users\joe.bloggs\documents\my robohelp projects\shared files\, but when user b "gets" the latest files from the server the links are broken because they're not joe bloggs!

<s>hi there 
any time you are working with source control you will be on a server.</s><s> that's the nature of the beast.</s><s> you must have a common point of storage where all access things.</s><s> the trick, however, is that source control maintains an area called a "working folder" that you also configure.</s><s> this area is typically on your local c drive.</s><s> as you work with files, they are checked out to you and copied to the working folder where you make edits.</s><s> this keeps you safe in robohelp as it only likes working with local files.</s><s> when you are finished editing, you check the files in and they are copied from your working folder to the source control repository. 
</s><s>not sure what to advise on the root.fpj issue.</s><s> are all your files in a single folder and that folder is in the root?</s><s> if so, that probably explains it.</s><s> you really need to organize files into folders.</s><s> i'm not sure if rsc likes it when you have two different users updating content in the same folder.</s><s> it may allow it, but i don't use it much so am not sure.</s><s> hopefully another user can advise on that.

<s>hi, molly btw, i notice you are from colorado, too!</s><s> i'm from evergreen.</s><s> i am not a power user of robosource control, but i'll try and relate what others have told me.</s><s> if you have further questions, you should probably post them in the source control sub-forum where there are great power users (like gravenstein, amebr, themarcus7, elisafnord and mergethis) who might assist you more quickly. 
</s><s>when you open the project to a folder on your hard drive, that becomes your working folder.</s><s> some authors keep the content in the same folder day after day and "get the latest version" whenever they start a session with robohelp.</s><s> in theory this keeps everything in sync.</s><s> your co-worker would do the same.generally i open the entire project to my working folder and not a particular file. 
</s><s>i've heard some authors choose to delete their working folder and reopen it each day.</s><s> this way, they know they'll be getting all the freshest changes and content. 
</s><s>another getting started tip: remember "opening" a project is not the same thing as "checking" it out.</s><s> this is a common misconception.</s><s> you can open the project and look at it, etc. without it being "checked out".</s><s> the red checkmark icons won't appear until you actually attempt to change some content, that's your cue that it has been checked out and no one else can work on that particular file. 
</s><s>also, remember that when you work on them, you are not only checking out topic files, but the .hhc file for the toc, the .hhk file for the index, the .glo file for the glossary, etc. so it will make sense for you and your co-worker to have a plan on who will mainly work on which parts of the project.</s><s> also it is typical for an author to be the "designated publisher" and establish a routine that works best for you. 
i wrote an article for an older version of robosource control on the adobe developer network website.</s><s> much of the material is still valid and may be helpful. http://www.adobe.com/devnet/robohelp/articles/robosource_control.html see toward the end, the sub head: summary workflow strategy for content management

<s>sorry, i don't use source control so cannot comment on whether branching works or not.

</s><s>what the .</s><s>cpd is, is a microsoft access database file using a custom file extension.</s><s> i've since abandoned documenting the innards of it because it is now just a cache file used in conjunction with the .</s><s>xpj file and its merry band of other support files.

<s>hi cm, i'm a bit snowed under today.</s><s> but in a nutshell, we check in all the project files but are very very careful when checking out different file to different authors.</s><s> we make one author the vss controller and they are in charge of the toc index and other files that get updated when working with the project.</s><s> other authors 'get the latest' version and work with a copy of the project.</s><s> they can checkout specific .htm files or adding new .htm files to the project.</s><s> that way we keep sane!</s><s> the only problems we've had is with the .apj but i think this somehow got checked out to other contributers.</s><s> if you work with robohelp source control x5 you'll need to set up the database etc which is covered in the online help.</s><s> however, the latest version robohelp 6 intergrates with vss and other source control software.</s><s> the guys at adobe put a lot of work into this.</s><s> check out the article: http://www.adobe.com/devnet/robohelp/articles/robosource.html hope that helps and sorry to rush craig

<s>hey, cathy!</s><s> the robosource control in x5 was "adequate" in its day.</s><s> but remember, that was nearly 4 years ago the problem was that the "free" access database was not really robust enough and to really make use of it, you need to use ms sql server, which is expensive.</s><s> that was then.</s><s> this is now.</s><s> the robosource control 3 that comes with robohelp 6 is way more better this is because, it allows you to use a free version of ms sql server express for a much more robust database.</s><s> so my advice would be to upgrade to robohelp 6 for sure.</s><s> it's not just hype.</s><s> if for some reason you can't upgrade, then you might be able to get away with the access database given that there are only two of you.</s><s> since you already have it, you could create a little test bed project and try it out.</s><s> (i have a suggestion for how to do that in my article.</s><s> see link below) for the lowdown on robosource control 3 see this matthew ellison's fine article getting started with robosource control 3 in robohelp 6 if you're interested in the "old" robosource control that comes with x5, you can check out my article to get you started.</s><s> sharing one robohelp project among multiple authors thanx, john
