<s>hi robocolum, 
</s><s>with 2 panes set up for the new window, if we search in webhelp: "applicant service representative", the rank is #1. if we search in webhelp pro, nothing found. 
with single pane, this kind of issues are fixed. though users need to click extra "show" link to get into 2 panes. and substring is still not working consistently: if we search vaccine or vaccin, we get result, but if we search vacci or vacc, there will be no results, but if we search vac, all the topics include vac will show up. 
we thought comparing to getting statistical reports, we would sacrifice the extra show click step and substring for short term till adobe get us a better solution, but now they are telling me with single pane rh9 server stops generating reports. 
so that's i want to know how other company implemented rh9 server and still get a good searching function. otherwise, rh server 9 won't bring us any benifit.

<s>sorry peter, i will try: 
with a normal output window, it should be two panes, which you can see the search button and other buttons immediately. but within this normal window, if i search ""applicant service representative", there is no result return. 
so support helped us to change to single pane, as you can see from the first screen shot. the user will have to click on the show link then go to the second screen shot,-normal window and when they start to search in this second screen, they are able to get result from searching ""applicant service representative". 

it seems that extra step- change from single pane to two panes improves the searching function.

<subject>Configuring RoboServer 9 for primary/secondary failover redundancy</subject>
<post author="JuliaZ-RRD" timestamp="Sep 2, 2013 3:39 PM">
<s>i am in the process of finalizing the configuration plan and pre-installation documentation for our robohelp server 9 system.</s><s> we've got 15 seats of robohelp 10 and that many content contributors working on four major product lines.</s><s> the roboservers (two) will be installed in windows azure using wndows 7 vms, sql server express (which i believe we will outgrow), and the rest of the software requirements. 
i really want us to configure once for two servers such that one is the primary or master server and the other is the secondary or "slave" server.</s><s> the secondary server will only come online if and when the first server fails or does not respond quickly enough; then i expect the second server to come online automatically and quickly. 
</s><s>does adobe support this scenario in the software or am i going to be doing some fancy coding/configuration in windows or (worse still) in my applications that point to the roboservers to serve help results? 
</s><s>ideally, content creators would publish once and the new content would automatically mirror to the second server within minutes.</s><s> i realize i may have do this as some sort of nightly batch job instead.</s><s> i'm probably off in dreamland by now but i would really like to configure the primary server, tell it about the secondary, redundant server, and then have adobe automatically duplicate all user-account information and other details to the redundant server without any additional instructions.</s><s> i suspect this is all pie-in-the-sky and that i'm going to have to hand-manage everything on the two machines separately, though doing so is hardly what i would consider "enterprise class".</s><s> i'm still an optimist and i'm hoping i can do this handholding without too much pain after the initial configuration push. 
</s><s>anyone have any experience with such a scenario?</s><s> the primary software product that we're supporting is considered an enterprise-class vhu (very high uptime) system and i'd really like to have the help system available just as many hours as the product itself. 
</s><s>by the way, i'm sure you've gathered that i'm not a full-time it person as some of the details are quite hazy to me.</s><s> i'm a documentation manager and as i proposed this roboserver as a solution to our publication and user-access-management problems, i'm tasked with developing the implementation planning documents.</s><s> our it folks told me to buy two licenses so they can set up redundant servers without investigating if that was a supported configuration, and now i am trying to figure out how to make it work. 
</s><s>i've reached out to adobe technical support but they escalated my call and i won't get info from them until tomorrow.</s><s> i learned late last week that we are the first group within rr donnelley to implement roboserver and corporate it is watching my project closely; if it does well, they will recommend it to other groups publishing using robohelp throughout the company.</s><s> no pressure!

unless you have a typo or you plan on switching output formats, robohelp server is a moot point here. 
</s><s>you stated you are producing winhelp.</s><s> that's a really old format and microsoft would like to see it die a quiet death.</s><s> but some folks still produce it.</s><s> robohelp server is designed to serve html files created by robohelp.</s><s> so if you really are creating winhelp and don't plan on switching things, then you can forget all about robohelp server.

</s><s>there are two ways you can refer to a topic of one project from another for projects published to robohelp server.

</s><s>so server path of topic1.htm is => <rhs install>/ robo/server/area1/projects/help1/topic1.htm and server path of topic2.htm is => <rhs install>/ robo/server/area1/projects/help2/topic2.htm 
to refer to topic1.htm from topic2.htm, you can use relative path as : <a href="../help1/topic1.htm">link</a>  here are some other sample urls that might come in handy that i have used. http://localhost:8080/robohelp/admin (to reach the adminstrator application and manage robohelp server. 
</s><s>url to a project called employeecare (&prj) and to an area called humanresources (&area) http://localhost:8080/robohelp/server?prj=employeecare&area=humanresou rces

<s>rh10 rhs9 
</s><s>a bit confused here, and not sure if this should be posted in the multiscreenhtml5 forum too.... 
i can publish our help in flashhelp pro format, to our trial robohelp server, and gather stats from multiple workstations around the office.</s><s> no problems there.</s><s> i can publish our help in multiscreen html5 format, to our web server and view it on multiple devices.</s><s> it works.

</s><s>when i build the help in multiscreen html5 format, i see there's an option to configure server settings in order to publish to a server.</s><s> it's occurred to me that these settings refer to our web server - not the robohelp server.</s><s> is this the case? 
</s><s>assuming this is the case, i imagine there may be a way for our systems admin people to monitor the use of our help on mobile devices, tracking topics hits, search terms and so forth.</s><s> however, it doesn't make sense for us to use a customised system like that for html5 access on the one hand, and robohelp server for the 'desktop' access on the other.</s><s> we need one system to gather all stats, preferably robohelp server.</s><s> if we can't gather html5 stats via robohelp server, it may be the deal breaker re purchasing it once our trial version has expired.

<post author="symmetricalMan" timestamp="Feb 11, 2013 5:41 PM">
<s>hi all, i'm trying to figure out whether rh server is the solution for us. i've seen a few similar posts in the forums, but none that really answer my specific questions.</s><s> i'm hoping for feedback from someone with experience in rh server, who is perhaps in a similar situation to us. Ê we are a software development company, creating desktop software for pcs.</s><s> we have three main applications, and approximately 20,000 users.</s><s> i am the company's (only) tech writer. Ê currently i provide documentation (user guides) to our clients in the form of the good ol' chm file.</s><s> i develop these in rh8.</s><s> each of our applications is bundled with an installed chm file which users access by pressing f1.</s><s> i'm sure you're all familiar with this process.</s><s> our users run our software on their own systems, completely independent of us - there's no connection to us whatsoever.</s><s> however, they all have internet access, as it's a requirement for them to be able to use certain functionality within our applications.</s><s> hold that thought. Ê i also write knowledge base articles in ms word, as pdfs, which users access via our web site.</s><s> internal to our organisation, i provide kbas and other such material for our technical support staff.</s><s> these aren't available/accessible to the public.</s><s> i write these in word because they need to be sent around to a team of reviewers from time-to-time, and whilsti'm the only person with rh installed, everyone has word. Ê what i'm hoping to achieve with rh server is this: Ê do away with the old chm files that our users have.</s><s> they're just awful.</s><s> i'm hoping that in future, when our users press f1 from within our applications, they will be taken to a corresponding page on a web site or air page similar to what the adobe help looks like when we access it from robohelp.</s><s> forgive my ignorance if i've used incorrect terminology.</s><s> that way they'll always be reading the latest help content, live, online, instead of what i wrote last time we sent a product update out.</s><s> i imagine our programmers will have to edit the functionality behind the action of our users pressing f1 in our applications.</s><s> has anyone done this?</s><s> are there any issues we should be aware of?</s><s> what happens if our users don't currently have internet access, for example - is it possible to call a local version of the help instead, if this is detected?</s><s> has anyone done this with a similar number of users to us?</s><s> we could well have 100s of users trying to access the system simultaneously.</s><s> gather feedback from users.</s><s> from what i understand, we'll be able to use rh server to see which help topic/content is being viewed, and also receive feedback from users.</s><s> can anyone give me feedback on their experiences with this?</s><s> any tips/hints/issues i need to be aware of?</s><s> is it possible for us to determine which users accessed which content?</s><s> remember, the idea is that users should be able to access this content by pressing f1 - i don't want them to have to sign in every time they need to access our help system - it should be seamless to them.</s><s> so, i'm wondering how it would be possible to track user usage without making them sign in.</s><s> this is important to us because some of our content is region-specific, and it would be handy to know if users from those regions are actually accessing the help content that relates to them.</s><s> host our internal documentation on the same server as our public documentation.</s><s> is it possible to host all of our internal, private documentation on the same rh server, making it available to our tech support team (and other internal teams) only?</s><s> i imagine we could do this by password-protecting it, but i want to ensure that the public don't even know it exists. ...and our tech support people would not be impressed with having to sign in every time they wanted to access their knowledge base.</s><s> any tips here regarding locking down / restricting access to content? Ê a quick note about collaboration: currently, although the help menus are developed in rh, the kbas and other pdf documents are written in ms word.</s><s> i send them around to a team of reviewers who add their comments/edits and send them back to me.</s><s> from what i understand, this is something i can do with rh10 - export pdfs and send them around for review, combining the results later, at which time i give them a final review before publishing.</s><s> have i understood this correctly?</s><s> does rh server play a part in this process?</s><s> can i use rh server's feedback capabilities as a mechanism for my review team to make edits/comments?</s><s> i guess i'm trying to get an understanding of how sophisticated the rh server feedback system is.</s><s> if i can use rh server to have the team read/review documents, it'll save me having to manage a bunch of word documents that i email them.</s><s> it'll also minimise the chance that a redundant document gets distributed by mistake - something that can occur because people use their locally-saved documents i emailed them earlier, instead of the finals.

<s>hi, symmetricalman let's see if i can tackle some of these "inline".</s><s> there are a lot of moving parts to your system (you're a busy guy!</s><s>) i only have time for a few of these.</s><s> perhaps colum mcandrew and others will chime it with their experiences. 
>>they will be taken to a corresponding page on a web site or air page similar to what the adobe help looks like when we access it from robohelp. 
</s><s>it would be webhelp pro in the scenario you mention (not air help).</s><s> by "taken to a corresponding page" you are referring to context sensitive help which robohelp server does support (including your f1 scenario). 
>>what happens if our users don't currently have internet access, for example - is it possible to call a local version of the help instead, if this is detected?</s><s> hmm.</s><s> you could either package a plain webhelp (not pro) output and distribute for access on a share drive.</s><s> the detection thing would be up to your developers.</s><s> come to think of it, air help does have a potential alternative here which might be worth looking into.</s><s> obviously, there would be two systems to maintain.</s><s> i'm not up to date on it, but you'll find info here in the online help: http://help.adobe.com/en_us/robohelp/robohtml/ws81f63111-6acf-4a02-b2b 2-461febfa8093.html 
>>.we'll be able to use rh server to see which help topic/content is being viewed, and also receive feedback from users.</s><s> actually, the "feedback" is anonymous (no names are collected.</s><s>) you can however, create "areas" and analyze the traffic on topics according to sub-sets of your users.</s><s> the feedback is not direct from the users.</s><s> in other words, robohelp server (at least for now) does not support commenting (as air help does).</s><s> so feedback reports are derived from the end-users "surfing" your site and collecting their search terms verbatim to get an idea of what they are searching for in order to improve your content. 
>>so, i'm wondering how it would be possible to track user usage without making them sign in.</s><s> rh server sites do not have to be "protected" by authentication.</s><s> it is your choice.</s><s> you can have some sites (called areas) that are authenticated and some sites that are not authenticated, all on the same rh server.</s><s> robohelp server uses a database and can authenticate users (by setting up protected "areas".</s><s>) however, my networking knowledge is limited and you would have to ask someone else about "persistent logins" etc. 
>>content is region-specific, and it would be handy to know if users from those regions are actually accessing the help content that relates to them.</s><s> yes, you can do this.</s><s> this is where robohelp server can be used to create "areas" for different content to be delivered to different audiences. 
>>is it possible to host all of our internal, private documentation on the same rh server, yes you can.</s><s> however the tech support sign in scenario question would have to be answered by someone else.</s><s> it's hard to know from where i sit. 
>>rh10 - export pdfs and send them around for review, combining the results later, at which time i give them a final review before publishing yes, this workflow would seem to work for you.</s><s> however, robohelp server plays no role in this review one way or the other.</s><s> there are many alternatives for sharing the pdf which is described in the documentation.</s><s> see #6 on this page: http://help.adobe.com/en_us/robohelp/robohtml/ws1b49059a33f77726-2db1c 75912bc47baaf8-7ffb.html 
</s><s>you should also download the adobe robohelp server reviewer's guide which also has videos embedded. http://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/robohelp/9/adoberobohelp server9_reviewersguide.pdf

<post author="RoboColum(n)" timestamp="Feb 12, 2013 2:13 AM">
<s>as john has pointed out you'd need to generate webhelp pro output in order to publish to the robohelp server application.</s><s> this is more or less the same as webhelp output but with a few minor differences in the way you setup the single source layout.</s><s> we use f1 help here and it works very well.</s><s> we also update out help in real time making it very easy for users to access the help directly after we publish it and more importantly withiut our users having to do anything. 
</s><s>some of our users do not have internet access.</s><s> in this case we deliver an offline version of our help that is installed as part of the client application.</s><s> we used to deliver chms that were installed as part of the application to the user's hard drive.</s><s> now we devliver webhelp that is installed on the client's application server.</s><s> our application requires this setup.</s><s> this may not be an option for you but you could deliver webhelp and install it locally.</s><s> the disadvantage of this is that any updates you make are not available but as most users would have internet access this is not a big problem for us. 
</s><s>john has touched on the concept of protected areas.</s><s> these require a logon to access the help.</s><s> if you have hundreds of users you could spend a lot of your time maintaining a list of users and passwords if you adpot this approach.</s><s> you sound like you have a lot on your plate so i wouldn't recommend this approach unless you could train and persuade someone to look after this for you.</s><s> this would require you giving them full admin rights to the robohelp server application though which is potentially dangerous! 
</s><s>imho one of the drawbacks of robohelp server is that the feedback reports do only part of the job.</s><s> yes they do show page hits, including a useful report on pages accessed by f1, but they do not say whether they are the same user.</s><s> some of the reports allow you to filter on ip addresses which can be useful if you know these.</s><s> it would be really cool if the reports provided the same level of detail as google analytics, but they don't :-( 
</s><s>as for your internal documentation you could host these in a seperate area (or possibly context).</s><s> this maybe a case where the use of a protected area would prove useful but again someone would have to maintain userids / passwords.</s><s> if your tech support peeps don't want to login, a seperate context is the way i'd go personally. 
</s><s>finally robohelp 10 does allow reviewing of robohelp topics.</s><s> you have to have acrobat pro installed (this comes as part of the adobe tech comm suite if you buy this).</s><s> you create a pdf from your robohelp output which can be shared with colleagues.</s><s> this can be via sharepoint if you have this.</s><s> the reviewer opens the pdf and adds comments, etc using the free adobe reader application.</s><s> when they have finished you simply import those back in and accept / reject as required.</s><s> this workflow works well but in my experience a major limitation is the reviewers unfamiliarity with acrobat.</s><s> they just hate it!</s><s> if you can win them over at your end, you may have a chance with this.</s><s> either way you can still author in robohelp and output to microsoft word for the review.</s><s> it just means you'll have to manually apply any comments to your robohelp topics. 
i think that is everything.</s><s> if i have forgotten anything, or you need any clarification on what i've offered, please post back.

<s>much appreciated, john.</s><s> will sift through these.

<s>hello, i would like to introduce the "enhanced search" feature of robohelp server 8.</s><s> robohelp server 8 has two modes of search.</s><s> in one mode of search, robohelp server uses the search-index generated by the robohtml client which is published to robohelp server when the project is published.</s><s> in the other mode, robohelp server re-generates the search-index at server.</s><s> this is the default mode of indexing used by robohelp server 8.</s><s> server side indexing (reindex=true) vs client side indexing(reindex=false) advantages of server side indexing as compared to client side indexing- a) this mode has better support for unicode search like cjk languages.</s><s> b) this search also supports wildcard search.</s><s> c) its more efficient and robust.</s><s> d) server administrator can schedule reindexing of server documents at specified time.</s><s> any additional documents in pdf, doc, xls, ppt or txt format can be added to project folder on server machine explicitly at anytime and when scheduled indexing happens these documents will be indexed too and show up in search results.</s><s> this gives admin the flexibility to add documents other than robohtml published format to robohelp server and make them available to their end user via this search functionality.</s><s> limitation of server side indexing as compared to client side indexing- a) project synonym list, phrase list and stop list is ignored while re-generating search index at server side.</s><s> b) topic context is not shown in searh results.</s><s> however new search enhancements introduced in robohtml 8 like keyword search, ranking, excluding topic from search result are supported in both the modes.</s><s> to change the mode of indexing, user can follow these steps -go to <rhserver8 installation path>/web-inf, -open robohelp_server.properties file in notepad. -set reindex=false (by default it is set to true). -restart the server(restart tomcat service) depending on their requirement, user can choose either mode of search.</s><s> tulika.</s><s>

<s>john/vern, tulika helped us get robohelp server 8 running last friday (3/20/09) but unfortunately, our help system still is not functioning because there appears to be some problem with the content that's preventing robohelp server from running.</s><s> specifically, tulika says: "the problematic characters are : < (less than), > (greater than), " (quote), & (ampersand), ' (apostrophe) scan your: 1) topic names 2) topic file names 3) toc book/page name and remove any occurrence of the above mentioned characters." tulika and other adobe support staff thought we could resolve the problem by upgrading the client version of robohelp to version 8.</s><s> however, that did not solve the problem and we need to scan literally hundreds of help files for the above characters.</s><s> these "problem characters" of course have always worked in the previous versions of robohelp (since v4) and we believe the robohelp client should trap for characters if they are not supported on robohelp server 8.</s><s> john i'm really glad your installation has gone well because i can definitely say ours has not.</s><s> yes, i'm sure much of this has to do with us not being familiar with tomcat and jre but i also don't believe we should be required to figure out how to find, download and configure these applications when, in our opinion, they should be part of the install.</s><s> my tech guys tell me adobe has used tomcat before in a product called version cue but it was completely transparent.</s><s> meaning, tomcat was installed and configured as part of the cs3 installation, which is exactly what we would have love to happened here.</s><s> to give you some idea of what it has taken to get this installed here is our time-line: - purchased robohelp server 8 on 2/4/09 - tried to get it running internally for 2 weeks. - engaged adobe support on 2/24/09 - meeting w/ adobe support engineers 3/2/09 - meeting w/ adobe support engineers 3/3/09 - meeting w/ adobe support engineers 3/4/09 - (little to no response from adobe during these 2 weeks.</s><s>) - called support on 03/16/09 and wouldn't get off the phone until i talked to a support manager.</s><s> well, i had to get off the phone but jeri did promptly call me back. - meeting w/ adobe support engineers 3/18/09 - meeting w/ adobe support engineers 3/20/09 - unresolved, support system still down (problem with "content") additionally, there has been dozens of e-mails going back and forth between adobe and our company, literally begging them for help.</s><s> we came to our breaking point last week and finally demanded adobe escalate this issue to their engineers/developers.</s><s> that's when we hooked up with 2 people that really made a difference: shawn cormier and tulika garg.</s><s> both of these people are top-notch and are the ones who got the server running for us on friday (3/20/09).</s><s> as of this writing, tulika is still trying to pin-point exactly what file in our robohelp project is causing the problem with the server (yep, we zipped up our entire project and sent it off to tulika).</s><s> we're hoping for two things: (1) she can find it so we don't have to spend hours/days debugging this problem and (2) what we sent her will help adobe fix the client and server software so others don't run into the same problem.</s><s> this post is not meant to disparage adobe or their support staff, engineers, etc. in any way and i hope it ends up being useful to someone out there (tulika actually asked me to post this for you Ð which i thought was pretty big of her).</s><s> good luck to all.

<s>hi kristen, 
</s><s>the way merged projects should be published to robohelp server 8 is as follows: 
1) as correctly pointed out by peter, generate parent project which will create mergedprojects sub-folder inside the published output and the necessary folders for each child.</s><s> you then have to generate each of those projects to the appropriate folder under mergedprojects. 
2) now you just need to publish the "parent project only" to robohelp server 8 as you would publish any other project by creating a server configuration and specifying server url as "<server-name>:<port>/robohelp/server" and required user name and password. 

3) please note that you don't need to publish the sub-projects separately to server as they will be published along with the parent project if you have copied their output to the correct folder inside the mergedprojects folder of parent project. 
4) robohelp server will automatically scan and figure out that the parent project contains some sub-projects and when you will view them in web admin ui, you will get a complete listing of parent project and also the sub projects. 

</s><s>just on a side note, it would be great if you could create new discussion threads for different issues.</s><s> this way it will be helpful for other users as well who are trying to find help on similar issues.

<s>thank you so much for all your help, tulika and peter. 
</s><s>we were pleased and amazed that we actually got everything published to our rs 8 server on friday afternoon.</s><s> should i start a new discussion to post the steps we took? 
</s><s>it was a bit different than the way we have done it in the past, and i couldn't believe that now robohelp is "smart" enough to recognize the child projects and publish them into the appropriate subfolders automatically.</s><s> but here is a brief recap of what we did (sort of a cross between peter and tulika's methodologies).</s><s> let me know if there's an even better way, but this definately works. 
1) we have three authors using rh7 client.</s><s> we set up all their folders to be the exact same on their local drives, and they are checking project files in and out of source control as needed.</s><s> these are the "child" or subprojects.</s><s> everyone created new folder at the root of their "my robohelp projects" folder called "generated".</s><s> this is where we point their local output to go (versus ssl...but maybe we should not have not changed that?</s><s>).</s><s> 
</s><s>2) we created a "parent" or master project, which only contains a home page and one toc book, into which all but 1 of the subproject placeholders were created (these are "work instructions" by different subject area).</s><s> the remaining subproject placeholder was placed at the root of the toc, following the book, as it contains "generic" content that is applicable to all subjects areas (e.g., forms, related documents, release notes, etc). 
3) we published the master project as webhelp pro to the rs 8 server (server name syntax: <server>:<port>/robohelp/server).</s><s> when we view the project using the robohelp server web admin utility, we see only the home page.</s><s> however, logging onto to the server using remote desktop, and viewing the folder structure, we can see that a subfolder was created called "mergedprojects", with subfolders beneath that for each of the children projects as defined in the parent project's toc.</s><s> at this point, however, these subfolders are empty. 
4) we published all the subprojects as webhelp pro to the rs8 server using the same server string as above (we were not able to point them into the mergedprojects\subproject folder as we did when publishing webhelp to the rh5 server).</s><s> at this point, we now see that there are folders for each of the subprojects at the same level as the parent project on the server. 
5) we re-publish the parent project exactly as we did in step 3.</s><s> however, now we can see in the output pod, that files are being copied to the mergedprojects\subfolders.</s><s> indeed, if we watch the progress on the server, we see the files being populated in the mergedprojects\subproject folders.</s><s> robohelp actually "knows" now that those files need to be there.</s><s> amazing!</s><s> 
</s><s>6) when we go to "view project" using the server utility again, the master still doesn't show the content of the child projects.</s><s> however if we enter the following url in internet explorer, we see our master project with all the child content, organized in the toc just as expected.</s><s> the path is: http://<server>:<port>/robohelp/robo/server/general/projects/<masterproject>/ <startpage.htm>.</s><s> this would be the shortcut we distribute to our users or link to from other applications/help systems. 
7) so now, our workflow will be that the authors will continue to work on their individual projects.</s><s> they will generate locally and view the output to do their own qa, etc. then they will publish to the server.</s><s> either daily or as needed, our "robocop" (who is responsible for the master project and coordinating everyone else's efforts), will publish the master project to capture and post all the changes made to the subprojects. 
</s><s>overall, i'm really happy with the new rs 8 server and very happy to be able to report a success story.</s><s> we've been using the trial version for 2 weeks now, and unlike rs7, it has not crashed or had to be rebooted once!</s><s> we already got the approval to purchase the upgrade.</s><s> we will continue using rh7 client for now, as they only recently upgraded from v5. 
</s><s>again, that's to everyone for their help and support. -kristen

<s>hi kristen, Ê glad to know robohelp server 8 is working great for you. Ê i want to make a small point on you steps to get your merged projects published to robohelp server 8. Ê ........ Ê 6) when we go to "view project" using the server utility again, the master still doesn't show the content of the child projects.</s><s> however if we enter the following url in internet explorer, we see our master project with all the child content, organized in the toc just as expected.</s><s> the path is: http://<server>:<port>/robohelp/robo/server/general/projects/<masterpr oject>/<st artpage.htm>.</s><s> this would be the shortcut we distribute to our users or link to from other applications/help systems. ............... Ê if you view your webhelp pro project using the url you mentioned above and viewing using "view project" from web admin ui doesn't give you the correct toc, then that implies there is some problem with your publishing mechanism. Ê using this url to view your project will prevent robohelp server from gathering any data needed to generate reports like "frequently viewed content", "frequently asked questions" etc. the correct url to view help should be "http://<server>:<port>/robohelp/server?prj=<masterproject>" Ê so you should essentialy follow the steps that i listed in my previous post where you aggregate all the child projects' output in correct folders inside "mergedprojects" folder of parent project's generated output and then publish the parent project only.

<s>hey rocky_xyzzy.</s><s> glad to see you're digging into the many flavors of output provided by robohelp and tcs.</s><s> the adobe community help (ach) client application is a hybrid proprietary system developed by adobe for all their products and not available as such.</s><s> however, from the scenario you describe, i think you could emulate something very close to what you see in ach by using air help output.</s><s> as you have discovered, it has favorites, commenting, moderation, and can be installed locally and easily updated.</s><s> you can even deploy it in such a way that the end user can select from different help systems or knowledge bases.</s><s> plus external content search allows you to pre-select certain keyword searches which would provide resources outside your help system similar to the way ach works.

Ê air help: since it is a desktop application in itself, it is installed in program files like other applications and creates an icon on the user's desktop.</s><s> if this is in fact "application help," the air help can be linked to an application via context sensitive calls using a provided csh api.</s><s> once the initial installation is made, there are numerous ways that this is then updated.</s><s> using the ssl wizard, the author can choose the location to store updates.</s><s> there is a choice to designate an http website url or as is often the case, there is a choice to point to an internal server or network share drive if the end user is behind a firewall or there is no internet connection. Ê pushing updates: the updates are simply single .air files that contain a version number change (this is all part of the ssl dialogs.</s><s>) so, the author generates an update and basically copies it to the pre-designated location on the network.</s><s> thus, when the end user accesses the air help, it will detect that a new version exists.</s><s> then, the end user will see a dialog that announces the availability of an update and if it is ok to continue.</s><s> this is how the updates occur. Ê adobe robohelp server 9: the project is published as you would to any web server, except that the server in this case has a database application installed which adds more functionality (and feedback analytics) beyond regular webhelp or air help.
