<s>wrt the mark of the web (motw) - it may no longer be relevant.</s><s> your question as to whether it should be on or off seems to imply that you really don't know what purpose it serves. 
</s><s>for starters, it is (or possibly was) specific to microsoft internet explorer browser.</s><s> when you generate with it enabled, it adds a specific line of code to all the html pages produced during the generation process.</s><s> you know how when you open microsoft internet explorer and view the webhelp from your local hard drive and you see that yellow information bar and you get a message about scripting and all that?</s><s> that's what motw is (or was) intended to prevent.</s><s> and this only happens when you view content from a local drive.</s><s> (files on a lan server still count as a local drive in this case) 
</s><s>once your content is served from a web server (where the address begins with http://) motw is about as pointless and helpful as an old tape deck with fried electronics.</s><s> it has no effect whatsoever on the content and the added lines are completely ignored. 
</s><s>my reason for being careful to be a bit evasive on whether it's still relevant is that the most recent versions of microsoft internet explorer have made many changes.</s><s> it's quite possible that motw is now irrelevant.</s><s> i believe that's why jeff was also suggesting you test using mozilla firefox.</s><s> that would confirm the content is there and it's just ie having the issues.

<s>hi everyone, and thanks in advance for any help you can offer. 
</s><s>one of our projects has four webhelp output folders.</s><s> each one contains subfolders for images, videos, and pdfs -- resources referenced within the topics. 
</s><s>our client has asked us to centralize these resources into a single folder so that these files -- especially large ones like videos -- don't need to have multiple redundant copies hosted on their servers.</s><s> so the top level folder structure that we deliver to the client should be: 
output1 output2 output3 output4 resources | |---images |---pdfs |---videos 
in the source, i now reference these types of files using "../../resources/videos/<filename>".</s><s> this relative path points to a folder outside the main rh project folder ("resources" is a sibling of the project folder). 
</s><s>in the case of videos and pdfs, everything works as expected.</s><s> the videos and pdfs aren't copied into the output folder. 
</s><s>but robohelp continues to copy all images into the output folder...into the *parent* output folder, not an "images" subfolder below it.

are you wanting users to be able to be using perhaps a french help output and suddenly change so they see spanish?</s><s> or are you just wanting to make sure your french or spanish version of the toc and index are presented?

<s>@william 
</s><s>thanks for taking the time to help!</s><s> i see your posts often in the forums, and i am thankful that you take the time to assist with questions. 
i tested your suggestion and used your script to convert the see also groups (controls) to hyperlinks.</s><s> although, using hyperlinks is not the desired approach; i was hopeful the suggested approach might be usable.</s><s> i much prefer see also controls and groups because updating and maintaining the included topics has proven to be easy in the past. 
i ran into a few problems. 
</s><s>the hyperlinks were added with formatting that needed to be changed (as expected Ð no problem i thought).</s><s> i searched for a way to change the formatting.</s><s> editing a css within some form of text editor is not my cup of tea as i don't have a knowledge of the tags, syntax, etc.</s><s> i need more an wysiwyg approach.</s><s> also, i couldn't find the style or class to be edited. 
</s><s>to edit the css, i did the following: 
in project manger, style sheets, right-click default.css (the style sheet for the project). 
</s><s>click edit.</s><s> 
</s><s>in the styles dialog box, i expanded all the styles listed. 
i did not find the see_also class or style that you mentioned in your readme.pdf provided with the script.</s><s> therefore, i couldn't find an easy way to modify the css.</s><s> it appears that changing the formatting of the converted hyperlinks is daunting. 
</s><s>the next and more bothersome problem relates to maintenance of the topics used in the list of converted hyperlinks. 
</s><s>the see also groups were maintained, but it appears that adding a new topic to the list of converted hyperlinks is a labor-intensive process.</s><s> it could be that i missed something. 
</s><s>as an example: 
i have a see also group (openfiles) that has three topics in it (topic 1, topic 2, topic 3). 
</s><s>the see also control was associated with each of the three topics. 
</s><s>the control was converted to a list of three hyperlinks in each topic as expected.</s><s> also, as expected, the topic being viewed was omitted from the list of hyperlinks, another desirable feature of the see also control. 
i need to add topic 4 to openfiles. 
i want topic 4 to appear in all locations where the openfiles see also control is used (was used originally), that is, in all three of the topics with the now converted hyperlinks.</s><s> as you know, this is possible by using a true see also control.</s><s> that is, a topic is easily added to all locations by simply adding it to a group. 
</s><s>after adding topic 4 to the group, the hyperlinks were not updated. 
i ran the script again hoping that the hyperlinks would be updated in all locations where the see also group was being used.</s><s> the hyperlinks were not updated. 
</s><s>it appears that i would have to work my way through all topics where the list of hyperlinks for openfiles appears and add the new topic to each list manually. 
</s><s>is there a way to add a new topic to openfiles and have it appear in all locations where the see also group is used, that is, have it appear in all locations where the converted hyperlinks are? 
</s><s>if the updating of the list can be simplified, then i will need to understand how to edit the format of the hyperlinks.</s><s> if the updating can be simplified, can you help me by providing some more details about locating and modifying the see_also style/class associated with the hyperlinks? 
</s><s>again, thank you for your assistance. ??

<s>hi, 
</s><s>you need to add that class yourself.</s><s> the easiest way to do this is simply to create a list style called see_also.</s><s> alternatively, paste the following code in the css and then use the editor to change the styling: 
li.see_also {} 
</s><s>as for labour intensive: it is.</s><s> i see no easy way to make this workable.</s><s> since the script removes the see also button, there is no see also control available to later add a list.</s><s> this conversion script is just that: it converts.</s><s> no way back.

<s>hi, 
</s><s>i am not sure if you are still looking for a solution to the original problem; in case you are, try this: 
open up ehlpdhtm.js present in your webhelp output in a text editor and search for the following: 
function _popupmenu_invoke_2() 
</s><s>this should occur in the document exactly once.</s><s> once you find this function, look for the following line inside it: 
else if (gbbsns6 || gbbskonqueror3||gbbssafari) 
</s><s>just a few lines below this else if structure, there should be an if else structure that looks like this: 
if (gbbsns6) { var e = fn_arguments[0]; neventx = e.pagex; neventy = e.pagey; } else { neventx = window.event.clientx; neventy = window.event.clienty; } 
</s><s>change the lines inside the else part to: 
neventx = window.event.pagex; neventy = window.event.pagey; 
save the file and try viewing the output in chrome again.</s><s> if there's no change, try clearing out the browser's cache.</s><s> this should fix up the misplaced popup menu issue.</s><s> needless to say, make a backup of ehlpdhtm.js before you make any changes.

<post author="DBenke" timestamp="Nov 20, 2013 5:54 AM">
<s>hi, 
</s><s>i want to create context sensitive webhelp using robohelp 9. we do not have numeric map ids to map the help topic to the web application.</s><s> so, we want to map the help topics using string (url) as a mapping id.</s><s> i've found some information on below link but i could not understand much.</s><s> means, i could not understand how to use that string and what is the significance of start page, what exactly we need to do with it. 
</s><s>link: http://www.grainge.org/pages/authoring/calling_webhelp/using_urls.htm 
this was the information given: via the start page any topic in the help can be called in such a way that the user sees the required topic, the navigation pane (toc etc) and the toolbar.</s><s> it is done by using the format x:/helpfolder/startpage.htm#path/target_topic_1.htm. where x is the drive letter.</s><s> provided the help is called in that way (startpage#target), the developers can use either an absolute path or a relative path.</s><s> that method is fine for calling one topic and is an approved method.</s><s> if you call a second topic in this way before the browser is closed, the new topic will not display and this was a problem.</s><s> there are two solutions that i am aware of.</s><s> solution 1 if your developers amend each call so that the first call has one query mark added and the next call has two query marks, then it will work correctly. startpage?#path/topic1.htm startpage??#path/topic2.htm after that calls need to alternate so it would continue as below startpage?#path/topic3.htm startpage??#path/topic4.htm my thanks to werner hutter for telling us about adding query marks to the call and tony harris for simplifying the method.</s><s> solution 2 add target="_new" to give something like startpage?#path/topic1.htm target="new" 
</s><s>for testing, i'm doing it just for one single project and not for merged project.</s><s> if anyone knows how to proceed with this kind of assignment, please let me know as soon as possible. 
</s><s>thanks in advance.

<subject>RH 10 generating webhelp viewing with IE11 - Error reading masterData.xml</subject>
<post author="rtkwolf" timestamp="Jan 24, 2014 9:54 AM">
<s>i'm using robohelp 10 and generating webhelp outputs for a merged project with 10 child projects.</s><s> i'm using ie as my default browser.</s><s> early this week windows updates and a java update (version 7 update 51) were installed on my laptop.</s><s> i generated my merged project (same as i've always done and never had any issues) locally on my laptop.</s><s> when i went to view the project the following error message displayed: error reading masterdata.xml.</s><s> at that time i noticed that my ie had updated to ie11.</s><s> i'm making a presumption that this error is due to the updates because last friday i published my project viewing on ie 10 and did not get the error.</s><s> as a side note, the project does go thru the complete generating process its just when i go to view the project is when the error occurs.</s><s> i can close the error message but when i select another topic the error appears again. 
i searched the adobe discussions to see if this is a known issue but i didn't see anything specific to robohelp 10 or ie11.</s><s> i did not try any of the previous workarounds that i read about in the discussions because they weren't specific to rh10 or ie11.</s><s> i did read thread 931964 and peter grainge topic on merging help but i'm not sure that this is the same issue since i've never had this error previously. 
</s><s>currently on a second laptop i'm in the process of evaluating robohelp 11 and did try to generate an output using a copy of the same project from the second laptop and i got the same error.</s><s> the second laptop also is using ie11.</s><s> neither laptops get this error using firefox (version 26) or chrome (version 32.0.1700.76) as my browsers.</s><s> my laptop is a dell latitude e5530 64 bit os windows 7 professional service pack 1. 
</s><s>any help would be greatly appreciated.

<s>long story short, after a very very very long amount of time spent convincing 2nd and 3rd level adobe tech support that it was indeed a bug in their javascript for webhelp, they finally provided us with a successive series of javascript replacement files for our webhelp templates that first fixed only the toc but not the search, and then the toc and the search but broke the ability to view attached files (such as attached pdfs).</s><s> we still haven't heard back from them regarding a true, final fix that indeed fixes the behavior of the search and toc without breaking the ability to click a link for an attached pdf and have it render successfully.</s><s> in the meantime, we've simply refactored our webhelp to use no attached pdf content out of desperation to at least get the original problem (non-functioning toc and search from ssl servers) corrected on our end.

<s>like the post above (post#28) i see this with help generated using rh10.0.0.287 on both win 8 and win 7 with ie10. 
</s><s>my help is online and uses a skin that has been used for several versions. 
i see this problem when the help is called from the desktop application, and i also see it when i open it directly from the browser.

i will try: adding mark of the web generating without a skin (ick) creating a new skin from scratch.

<s>hi folks, 
if you add the below line of code (between the <head> tags) to the index.htm page (i.e. the start page) in your published help, the problem appears to go away. 
<meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=emulateie7"> 
i republished the help and the code was still there; however, i cannot say for sure that this will always be the case - perhaps someone else can suggest a more reliable way to add this code. 
</s><s>you will need to clear your cache and so on to see this work properly.

<s>hi jeanne, 
</s><s>i think the issue has to do with the fact that ie10 disables compatibility view by default for internet sites and enables it for intranet sites (go figure). 
</s><s>this means that the behaviour could probably be described as expected. 
</s><s>you can force compatibility mode for internet sites if you use the code i posted above.

<s>hi, techdoc jeanne i hesitate to jump into the fray here, but if you continue to have issues, it might be worth looking into the notorious "chromeframe" issue that seems to be cropping up in several threads here.</s><s> my client encountered a similar issue to yours (though not exactly.</s><s>) it was fixed with a simple addition to the whver.js file.</s><s> we consolidated some of the fixes on peter grainge's site - item #10 in peter's "using robohelp 10" article.</s><s> it might be worth looking into. http://www.grainge.org/pages/authoring/rh10/using_rh10.htm Ê i post this because while your symptom is a bit different, you also mentioned that you are calling the help from an application and i wonder if that application may have installed a "chromeframe plugin" which interferes with some of webhelp's javascript code.</s><s> just a thought.</s><s> john daigle adobe certified robohelp and captivate instructor evergreen, colorado www.showmethedemo.com twitter: @hypertexas
