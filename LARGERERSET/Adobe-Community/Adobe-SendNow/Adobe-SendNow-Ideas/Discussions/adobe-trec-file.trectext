<s>dear sendnow team, 
</s><s>first, my sincere gratitude for your efforts in providing an excellent service.</s><s> i am developer and, as a basic member, have appreciated the ease with which i can send large files to my colleagues without going through the rigamarole of setting up ftp / sftp / etc. 
</s><s>second, as i have used the application, i think the following suggestions would help improve customer experience and provide this service a competitive lead over the other services available.</s><s> 1. provide an address book.</s><s> it doesn't need to sync with exchange, google, or other accounts, but some way to associate names and groups with emails would be fantastic.</s><s> 2. provide a receive files link.</s><s> if i wanted folks to send me large files, as a subscriber, it would be great if i could provide them a link that allowed them to "send" me a file (i.e. upload files to my account).</s><s> 3. offer a plan or capability to remove much of the adobe marketing to more personalize the email.</s><s> while the service offers logo support, in effect this creates an intrusive overlay on what is primarily an adobe presentation.</s><s> in other words, in leiu of advertising, generate revenue from paid subscriptions. *****4.</s><s> ease the restrictions placed on sent files.</s><s> as a developer, the virus scanning and tarball restrictions has on a number of occasions prevented me from using this capability.</s><s> ultimately, i will most likely have to opt for another service (i.e. yousendit) so that i can get code releases and packages out to the necessary parties.</s><s> i understand the need for computer security, but the level of risk aversion sendnow has adopted squeezes the development community out of the sendnow marketspace.</s><s> 5. mobile apps.</s><s> it would be great to get updates on file downloads from a remote application. 
no doubt your team is actively working on some of these.</s><s> am happy to discuss further. 
</s><s>regards, chris

</s><s>also, since it sounds like you've been able to use the service a bit, i'd like to invite you to participate in adobe's customer reference program; it would just consist of a 30-minute phone call with someone from the team here, so it wouldn't be a huge commitment.</s><s> we'd very much appreciate to hear your feedback on the product.</s><s> please let me know if you'd be interested in speaking with us; if you are, i can have our customer reference program manager contact you shortly.
