<subject>Solution for Retina Display issues with Acrobat 11.0.04</subject>
<post author="Luc Leroy @ Adobe" timestamp="Sep 17, 2013 12:33 PM">
<s>hi, there seems to be a problem some users experience upgrading to acrobat 11.0.04 on mac book pro's that support retina display.</s><s> in certain cases, acrobat still runs in low definition and the setting "open in low resolution" is checked and grayed-out (can't be changed). 
</s><s>one cause we've identified is a preference file that is not updated in certain cases and prevents the system from letting acrobat running in retina display mode. 
</s><s>to fix it you can try this: uninstall acrobat 11 remove library/preferences/com.adobe.pdfadminsettings.plist install acrobat 11 again use help/update to upgrade to 11.0.4 
</s><s>one of the knwon workflows is upgrading from a previous version of acrobat that had been installed before a system upgrade, or from an old version of acrobat such as 9 that is not supported on mac os 10.8. 
</s><s>please share your experience here and let us know if doesn't solve your issue.</s><s> we'll contact you case by case if needed, to make sure you can have acrobat run in high definition. 
</s><s>thanks, luc

<s>well... any pdf will have the same issues.</s><s> perhaps the page bouncing happens more earnestly with longer documents, but maybe not... it's hard to say - the page bouncing happens enough, at varying times, to be noticeably disruptive.</s><s> but the "add text callout" drawing markup frustration is a constant - selecting, grabbing, editing, moving and sizing are always a multi-clicking and haphazard affair, no matter what pdf you are working in.</s><s> and, as an aside, changing the properties and the authors is an amazing challenge - bried deeply and obscurely it requires relearning and googling everytime i have to do it (becasue the changes sometimes don't stick) - but that's another thread!

<s>i got the same error (1301), but my problem was caused due a python 3.3 installation, which caused the preinstall-scripts not to work. 
i found this by looking into install.log via the console app of os x, and saw this: installd[683]: ./preinstall:   file "/private/tmp/pkinstallsandbox.g21ykp/scripts/com.adobe.acrobat.a10.acrobatupd1019.tvx6vh/tools/checkspace.py", line 28

<s>i moved up to dual 1920x 1080 monitors.</s><s> the various system menus and captions became so small i had to increase the system dpi (dots per inch) to 192 (200%) in order to make them legible.</s><s> acrobat seems to import the new dpi inconsistently.</s><s> the main menus look great.</s><s> but floating dialogue windows, like edit/preferences or create/scan/custom scan, are too big to fit on the screen.</s><s> they run off the bottom, making the buttons inaccessible.</s><s> the only workaround i've found is to temporarily set my side-by-side monitors as though they were one over the other.</s><s> then the floating windows run off the bottom of one monitor and back onto the top of the second one.</s><s> this is a huge pain, and not a durable solution.</s><s> resetting the resolution every time i use acrobat to run my scanner isn't a workable solution.</s><s> changing the resolution completely scrambles the desktop.

<s>thanks for replying, stacy. 
</s><s>i'm running acrobat 9 pro, windows vista home.</s><s> more generally, i'm using the adobe cs5.0 production bundle.. 
</s><s>my current work-around in acrobat is to set the resolution of each monitor to 1920 x 1080 (native) and dpi to 132.</s><s> the user interface font is almost legible and the floating windows fit on the screen. 
</s><s>however, with these settings, the user interface font in the photoshop menu bar is illegibly small.</s><s> it appears not to scale up when i increase the dpi.</s><s> of course, i can dumb down my monitors by decreasing the resolution.</s><s> but i bought hi-res monitors specifically to get a hi-res look at images.</s><s> oddly, the pull-down menus do scale up. 
</s><s>in premiere, some elements of the user interface scale up (e.g. the menu bar) and some don't (e.g. the titles of individual windows and the details in the timeline). 
</s><s>in short, there seem to be inconsistencies in the way adobe deals with scaling for hi-res monitors, not only among applications, but also within applications.

then the program crashes and i get a long error message re "acrobat quit unexpectedly." recent update to 11.0.06 did not resolve.  is anyone else having this problem?  any solutions?  i would uninstall and reinstall, but i'm not sure how to do that.  i purchased through download.  the product is registered and i have a key code, but i don't  want to uninstall until i know how/where to download the program again.   this problem has rendered my acrobat xi virtually useless.  help!   this is the error message i'm getting:   process:     adobeacrobat [741] path:
