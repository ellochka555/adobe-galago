<s>i think it would be great if pp didn't require media cache files to do what it does, but...for now they're a necessity.</s><s> the problem is that occasionally those cache files go wonky and they need to be deleted so that pp can rebuild them.</s><s> and that's where things get tricky. 
</s><s>it's probably not a bad thing to completely delete the contents of both the media cache files and the media cache folders every now and then, if for no other reason than to clean up space on the hard drive.</s><s> those files do tend to build up.</s><s> but when you have a problem and need to delete only the files for a specific project, things are not quite as easy.</s><s> if you work with avchd or other dslr media, you often end up with a multitude of clips labeled identically (00001, 00002, etc.</s><s>) with no way to know which clip belongs to which project.</s><s> and even when you do work with uniquely named media, the files names are often random and locating which clips belong to which project would be a major pita. 
</s><s>we could set the location for those files to project specific folders manually.</s><s> this would make finding the project's cache files easy, but then every time we changed projects, we'd have to go in and change those settings.</s><s> that, too, is an unworkable option. 
</s><s>so here's the proposal.</s><s> premiere pro would create a project folder for each project's cache files, like it does with preview folders.</s><s> if you set your preview folder to a single location for every project, you will notice that pp automatically generates project folders within that single location.</s><s> this makes it very easy to locate and delete a specific project's previews.</s><s> i suggest the same for the cache files, thus making equally as easy to delete only the cache files for the project we're having trouble with, and not requiring every project to rebuild its cache, only the problem project.

here's the request i ended up with, if anyone cares to copy/paste: 
https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/mmform/index.cfm?name=wishform 
*******enhancement / fmr********* 
project specific cache 
i'd like to get the option to store cache files in project specific folders, much like preview files.</s><s> possibly via the addition of a checkbox under the current "save media cache files next to originals..." 
</s><s>why is this feature important to you?</s><s> cache files often need rebuilding.</s><s> right now there's no way to delete only the problem files.</s><s> we have to delete them all, which means even those that aren't a problem will need rebuilding when we reopen those projects.</s><s> this is wasted time waiting.

<s>i see your point.</s><s> i normally use media in only one project, but i can see the difficulty where media is used across multiple projects. 
</s><s>well, there are two possible solutions i can see here.</s><s> the first is to duplicate the cache files.</s><s> this keeps things organized on the hard drive making it very easy to delete only those files for a specific project, either because you're done and want to clean house, or because there's an issue and you need to rebuild them.</s><s> the advantage here is very easy file management outside of pp. the disadvantage is potential increased usage on the hard drive.</s><s> (given the affordability of storage these days, this is not a bad option.</s><s>)

1.</s><s> project specific cache folders.</s><s> (easy file management, but potential for duplicate cache files on the hard drive.</s><s>)

<s>louis, 
</s><s>the job of a mod, or host, in the adobe forums is rather a thankless one.</s><s> yes, they are sort of "police," but they also need to consider the flow of a thread, and jeff has been so very helpful, both here, and in the encore forum, that his job expands well beyond that of a mod. 
</s><s>now, he, like many others, is charged with certain rather strict guidelines, in his moderation.</s><s> there are many rules around here.</s><s> yes, adobe is very lenient, regarding users' complaints, so long as their comments are civil in nature.</s><s> they tolerate mention of competitive programs, where those are a better solution.</s><s> you will likely not find that on many other company-sponsored forums, but adobe makes exceptions.

<s>if this were a random project, i might be able to agree with you; however, the classroom in a book (cib) series tells you to copy the disk to a hard drive to use.</s><s> because of this comment, and others, i must assume that it is designed to be run from a random folder on a hard drive.</s><s> this makes total sense, especially for the new user. 
</s><s>prpro cib cs6 is an adobe product that should boot up flawlessly when the project is loaded.</s><s> it does not.</s><s> the reason?</s><s> based on the error reports prpro generated, prpro that generated the cib disk is utilizing absolute file addressing.</s><s> absolute addressing breaks the product any time the absolute path to the project is changed.</s><s> because the absolute path for the project cannot be predetermined in advance, relative addressing should always be used for projects and project assets.</s><s> this is an adobe implementation bug.</s><s> i have never seen a c or c++ project that uses absolute addressing for this very reason.</s><s> all addressing is relative so any project can be loaded from any network folder to any random local folder and work "out of the box". 
</s><s>you did have a gross misunderstanding in your comment.</s><s> premiere pro does know exactly where the project is.</s><s> premiere pro knows the project file is located exactly at the relative path "./" or "\\.".</s><s> that is where you loaded the project file from.</s><s> the locations of all the other files are well known relative to the ".proj" project file. 
</s><s>this explains why i think premiere pro should know exactly where all project assets are located. 
</s><s>it does not, however, it does not explain why i get an "import" file error using prpro cc when i attempt to correct file path errors and why i get a successful load and run with prpro cs6 after file path errors are corrected.</s><s> this is a serious "cloud" bug.

<subject>Premiere CC 7.1 - Red frames in playback and export</subject>
<post author="Nick_HE" timestamp="Nov 14, 2013 9:10 AM">
<s>having some problems after the 7.1 update. 
</s><s>in a variety of projects, on a variety of footage, we're experiencing random fully red frames (#ff000).</s><s> sometimes there are 1-2 frames in a clip, and occaisionally it's 80%-90% of the frames in a clip (this is less frequent).</s><s> it has never been all of the frames of a clip. 
</s><s>this happens: - on an undrendered timeline (you'll be watching an edit and you'll see a red frame - if you scrub back to it it'll still be there) - on a rendered timeline - in exports 
red frames that are visible on a timeline, are sometimes carried through to the export and sometimes not.</s><s> sometimes an exported file will display red frames that were not present on the timeline. 
</s><s>red frames seem to be based on clips, not sequence frames.</s><s> for example, in one of my exports, i had video footage with a lower third graphic over it.</s><s> in one frame of the export, a red box appeared over the graphic, but the main shot was not affected. 
</s><s>this has happened to the following types of footage: - .</s><s>mts (from c100) - .</s><s>mxf (from c300) - prores 422 mov - prores 4444 mov with alpha channel 
fixes that seem to work: - if an export has red frames, re-export.</s><s> watch the new one like a hawk.</s><s> repeat until you get lucky. - if a clip on a timeline has red frames, force a re-render via a crop filter or similar - quit premiere and reopen it 
system/environment details: - osx 10.8.5 - premiere pro cc 7.1 - mercury playback engine software only - often (always?</s><s>) i-frame only mpeg sequence settings - much (all?</s><s>) of the footage we've been working with has been on afp shares via gige with mtu of 9000 
i haven't been able to confirm yet: - whether this ever happens with locally stored footage - whether this ever happens when queueing to media encoder (rather than exporting from premiere) - whether changing to a quicktime desktop based sequence setting resolves the issue 
is anyone else experiencing this issue?</s><s> it's frutstratingly un-testable, since it seems to happen at random.</s><s> we'll continue to gather data points though and see if we notice any other trends. 
</s><s>edit: added additional system context

<s>thanks tstormsierra, glad to see it's not just us.</s><s> agree that it's not corrupt frames as they're always recoverable by grabbing premiere by the shoulders and giving it a good shake.

</s><s>now on this project, i am seeing red thumbnails on a majority of my clips in the timeline.</s><s> even at the beginning, the red thumbnail would indicate that the first frame is red, but as you can see in my screenshot (program monitor) i have the first frame selected on the timeline and it isn't red (like the thumbnail suggests) when played through there isn't any red frames in the clip at all.

<s>i'm in the same boat.</s><s> i work at a network who decided to move to premiere after the fcpx release.</s><s> it's been one problem after another, with the red frames being the latest thing. 
</s><s>we've been doing this since cs 5.5.</s><s> in my experience, transcoding footage to prores has improved premiere's performance - and now it's a part of our workflow unless i'm just going to cut natively in red. 
</s><s>nick_he - i don't have a fix for the problem.</s><s> it seems random.</s><s> usually it's only one frame for me and if i offline the file in question, then re-online it, it generally solves the issue.</s><s> if you render footage with the red frame in it, you'll need to get rid of the rendered files and start over once the red frame is out.</s><s> to do that quickly, i usually throw some footage below the clip in question causing everything to need to be re-rendered again.</s><s> hope this makes sense... 
</s><s>the issue is especially troublesome when we work with outside fx houses who deliver in prores 4444.</s><s> we just had a project with a lot of green screen work and this new update really screwed us. it wasn't anticipated, so a lot of time was spent using a codec that wouldn't give us issues, like animation or png sequences. 
</s><s>frankly, i like a lot of things that premiere has to offer, but it's just not solid.</s><s> when i have a full work day ahead of me i need every second i can get, and premiere tends to waste a lot of my time and be generally unresponsive.</s><s> for small projects it's okay but i'd really prefer to be cutting in avid.

problem only happens when rendering mp. the red frames appear in the renders only since the upgrade, and only when using prores clips as source items in comps.

cleared media cache files - did not help. tried prores footage from local drives and external drives and network drives - problem persists. tried many different prores source files - problem persists. tried increasing memory assigned to each core - problem persists. 
only solution for me at the moment is rendering with the "mp" option disabled (yet this is very much slower of course)

<post author="ivanengler" timestamp="Nov 28, 2013 9:09 AM">
<s>the error also appears with prores 422 files, but only after a certain amount of source data from prores 422 clips is processed / read 
i made a test comp in ae with only one gigantic prores 422 source clip (8000 pixels x 1000 pixels @25fps) and the error first appeared at around 1500 frames read from the source file (equalling a few gb of source read and processed). after the red frames error appears once, the erroneous red frames appear more often but never in the same place when rendering the same comp several times) 
i also made a test comp containing only a few full hd prores 422 clips (1920 x 1080, @25fps), there the error appeared only seldom (but still randomly). so it can be that a broader user base never experiences this erroneous behaviour at all. 
i also made a testcomp containing about 40 full hd prores 422 clips (each 1920 x 1080, scaled down to 10% in size and distributed all over the comp so i can see them all at once). the erroneous red frames appeared within the first rendered frames!</s><s>!</s><s> obviously, many qt files had to be open and read in parallel, and so the error appeared from the very beginning of the rendering / export. 
i suspect that the ae / pr applications open a ram buffer for each open prores source file they need to read, and that this buffers somehow becomes compromised when it overflows and when buffer resize / buffer clear / flush operations take place. 
of course i tested all sorts of ram assignents for mp rendering (1gb per core, 2gb, 4gb, 6gb) and i rendered with several different settings of how many cores and ram should be available to other tasks. but the error always appeared. randomly. 
--> fact in ae is, that nearly all mp renders / exports using prores clips as source files contained the bad red frames. when rendering without the mp option on (but of course up to 20x slower) so far i never experienced this error (of course always after fresh restarts once the error appeared)

<s>is there any way to get 24-bit audio in a sequence or project setting?Ê we see no option to create a 24-bit project or 24-bit sequence in premiere pro cc.

Ê this seems like it would be detrimental to the quality of our audio delivery and our standards.Ê how can we use the original 24-bit audio file from our designer?</s><s> why does the match sequence setting say our audio is 16-bit when it is not?</s><s> can we adjust the audio settings in premiere pro cc project or sequences to reflect a 24-bit audio.</s><s> thanks in advance!

<s>i have some security camera footage i need to analyze for a client.</s><s> it's a 704x480 avi using an imm4 codec.</s><s> it plays in wmp on several computers, however ppro does not like this codec.</s><s> imm4 vcm is new to me, but after reading up on it, it appears to show up in several security dvr products.
