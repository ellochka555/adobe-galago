</s><s>avid is already planning to do essentially the same thing.</s><s> what they're seeing is that all their resources spent on chasing people down and manufacturing physical product are no longer a burden adobe has to shoulder.</s><s> when it's cloud-based distribution, you save a lot of time and a lot of money.</s><s> from a development and distribution standpoint, it's a no-brainer. 
</s><s>at any rate, i think adobe is fully aware that they are jumping off a ledge here, but they've already seen very good success with the current adoption of the creative cloud.</s><s> for people still on cs3 or cs4, they recognize that these are not current customers.</s><s> people who bought cs4 did so in 2008 or 2009, so it was nearly 5 years ago.</s><s> that's a long time in tech and business. 
</s><s>for the hobbyist or home user who just likes to use the best tools (as opposed to say something like photoshop/premiere elements), you can still subscribe on a monthly basis, so if you plan to take a few days and edit the family video library into a montage, it'll cost you $75.</s><s> that's really not a lot of $$$ to have a month's worth of access to everything.</s><s> of course, if you just want to edit some video in premiere pro, you can rent that for only $20 per month. 
</s><s>adobe doesn't pay me to say "creative cloud is great!" but after using it for a year i definitely feel that way.</s><s> having paid only $360 this past year and gotten to use all of the tools in the master collection, it's been a very good deal!</s><s> i've used the cloud storage with my client projects and internal jobs, i started learning indesign (never had a chance before!</s><s>) and also got to use lightroom, which wasn't in any of the packages before (it's a really nice tool for photo management and basic editing). 
</s><s>if i had been paying full price, i'd have spent $600, and while that's not as good of a deal, it's about the same as the old pricing if you were to skip every other version of the cs upgrades.</s><s> if you only upgraded every 3 versions or longer, that's not a good deal, but at the same time, as i first stated above, you're not exactly a frequent flyer. 
</s><s>just my thoughts. 
</s><s>oh....somebody mentioned an avchd issue....what issue is that?</s><s> i'm on cs6, i edit a few dozen hours of avchd footage every week.</s><s> other than occasionally wishing it was avc intra footage, i never have any issues.</s><s> someone wish to clarify?

<s>all of the new info that was presented at max is now online at adobe's cloud site.</s><s> specifically, pricing is availble here.</s><s> there's also an faq available, for what it's worth. 
</s><s>they have a nice "complete" membership price for those of us that own cs-based desktop apps starting at cs3 and up: $360/year billed monthly.</s><s> ostensibly that gives someone access to all of the applications if they want them.</s><s> and certainly, those one-time licenses would be hugely expensive otherwise, were you to buy them all.

</s><s>oh boy!</s><s> they've added access and integration with behance!</s><s> ...</s><s> um.. so what?</s><s> i've never used it, never intend to, and don't really give a flying f*** in a rolling doughnut about behance.</s><s> nor do i really need help, comments, contributions, etc on the hobby clips that i make with premiere pro.</s><s> what i do isn't a community thing.</s><s> i suspect a lot of other hobbyists are the same boat. 
</s><s>there's some portion of adobe's customer base where this creative cloud thing makes sense (and cents?</s><s>) but they're going to quickly alienate the larger portion of their customer base in which it doesn't make sense.

<s>since i don't feel it would be right to take over the thread started by steven, i start a new one.</s><s> this thread is going to be dedicated to producing a movie as a result of those voluneers' joint efforts, who are members of adobe community. 
</s><s>the main objective for this project is to collaboratively create final product from scratch: from defining the project scope to finally publish a movie somewhere, be it a dedicated website or just youtube or vimeo, as we'll define later. 
</s><s>this main objective is not the only project's goal.</s><s> it is assumed, participants will be able to work on a particular tasks so as to improve their own skills in a desired field via sharing creativity, knowledge and skills. 
i also hope we'll gain the forum moderators' support so as to be able to appropriately update this original post so that others, who might arrive here later, will be able to understand at which stage the project is that time. 
</s><s>now let's try to define the project scope. 

</s><s>by 15 october we reached our first milestone and defined product scope and project constraints & quality criteria 
product scope 
item specification priority movie, the genre: tv commercial duration: 60 seconds quality: broadcast safe luminance & chrominance format: 1080p, 24 fps, h.264, 32/40 mbps compulsory elements: - 3d graphics and vfx (scifi) incorporated into live shots - specific consistent look (colour design) highest dedicated website genre: promotional website scope: 2 pages compulsory elements: - web animation - video streaming high official trailer genre: tv commercial duration: 30 seconds quality: broadcast safe luminance & chrominance format: 1080p, 24 fps, h.264, 32/40 mbps medium behind the scene movie genre: documentary duration: 2 minutes quality: broadcast safe luminance & chrominance format: 1080p, 24 fps, h.264, 32/40 mbps compulsory elements: - short interviews with the project participants - vfx breakdown medium talk show appearance genre: tv commercial duration: 30 seconds quality: broadcast safe luminance & chrominance format: 1080p, 24 fps, h.264, 32/40 mbps low poster genre: 16 x 9 billboard quantity: 1 sample format: 1920 x 1080 pix, png genre: 4 x 3 affiche quantity: 1 sample format: 1080 x 810 pix, png high print ads genre: glossy magazine ad, front cover quantity: 1 sample format: full page, page-proof pdf genre: newspaper ad, multi-column print quantity: 1 sample format: ? page, page-proof pdf medium article genre: review quantity: 1 sample format: page-proof pdf, ~500 words medium brief report on collaborative tools genre: review quantity: 1 article format: page-proof pdf highest 

</s><s>project constraints & quality criteria - 24 december 2013 is a strict deadline; - all media used in final product, from sound to 3d model textures, must be created by the project participants.</s><s> utilising stock media in final product is not allowed; - missing media or incomplete elements must be replaced with placeholders, white noise or subtitles, which explain what is missing (e.g. 'nice music is playing on the background' or 'nice colour grading applied here' etc.</s><s>); - the project is accepted as successful in terms of quality control, if no less than 90% of all planned work is complete.</s><s> the overall progress is calculated as the following ratio: (sum of complete elements multiplied by their weights) / (sum of all planned elements multiplied by their weights) - the project is accepted as successful in terms of attractiveness to external audience, if we reach 1 000 hits within three months after final product release, where 100 hits = 100 website landing page visits = 10 visits of 2nd page = 10 movie views = 1 movie download. 
</s><s>the following hits distribution is expected: 600 hits within 1st month after release; 250 hits within 2nd month after release; 150 hits within 3rd month after release. 
</s><s>discussion on the next project phase, planning tasks list and obtaining required resources, starts at comment #84.

<s>cool... 
okay, i recommend a 60 second tv commercial as the genre.</s><s> that would require a tight script and fast pace but it allows for many contributers to shoot individual scenes ( clips ) if the actual product lends itself to that type versatility ( a sports product, hamburger, coke, whatever ). 
</s><s>we would ideally have a website ( maybe with a simple database ) for team to sign up, give contact info, email address, etc.. and it needs to be secure to some extent..and report progress ( those could be fields in the database ).</s><s> samples of work either completed or in progress could be displayed ( via html5 streaming stuff ).</s><s> maybe uploads and downloads from site too... 
i have the equipment to do small setups , with lighting etc, but am new in my neighborhood so getting free locations to use might be difficult..</s><s>( interiors )... so i'd like to keep my own contribution desires open now... could be speedgrade or cc in general ...on the good ol pig. 
time duration to complete project should wait until we have the contributers express interest etc... as the more who work on it the faster we can probably do it.. 
</s><s>we should basically maybe imagine a production office that someone just opened in a new city...to do a job... and fill those positions.. production manager is important.. sorta like the nuts and bolts of keeping things in perspective and moving along... coordinating things. 
the script ideally will end up being tight enough to be a strip board.. and someone has to keep track of what is shot, what changes have to be made ( script re-write ) etc... 
editor... someone with experience or desire to learn this more better... should be into this along with the music composition or mixing etc. 
distribution... the place to show the product... 
critical review...</s><s> a place ( website again ?</s><s> ) .. to vote on and critique and review the results of the final showing...in two ways... aesthetically speaking , along with technically speaking... 
</s><s>plus 
</s><s>the overall impressions of those who contributed.... what worked, what was too slow, what didnt work.

<s>if we were to create a commercial, the product could always be "yoodles".</s><s> although there was a contest a decade ago that had a pretty decent yoodles commercial.</s><s> perhaps it is time to update it?

</s><s>how about a comercial for "instant movie".</s><s> enter a few simple parameters into the video camera, point the camera at the subject, and the movie automagically appears on youtube via a wireless connection 
the creation of the camera screens would be challenging, and a good 3d program could be used to create the camera itself.</s><s> integrating the 3d camera with live action could be a tough nut to crack.

<s>boy, those are great ideas you have, steve, about the potential product..</s><s> i was a little confused about some aspects ( couldnt imagine it ) but when it comes down to that fine tuning you could maybe add a link to something similar ( visuals , etc ).. or you could draw pics etc... 
cool ideas... 
fuzzy.. you happened to mention... ======= i hope we are ready to release by cristmas. ======= which made me think right away that instead of 'pizza' or yoodles , it could maybe be a xmas present ( anything wrapped like a present )...

anyway, i just discovered i may be too stupid to do much but will do what i can for sure.</s><s> the reason i feel stupid is cause i got the ninja and in trying to unlock the secret code to get avid to work on the ssd drive it took me like a freakin hour to actually accomplish that task..</s><s> ( the code " abcdefoi " turned out to be all letters except for the 0....which was a number....omg....

<s>i've now recuperated from the horrendous effort to get the ninja working with the ssd for avid codec.. due to my stupidity...and the next step ( also updated firmware ) is to put camera on tripod, hook up hdmi and attempt to record with the thing.. and the put into pig and see what happens in cs6.... 
so i've decided that since i have no clue what i'm doing with this basic shooting and putting into pig thing..</s><s> i would like to focus on " shooting" something and contributing some kinda clip ( with slated sound )... 
i can do whatever is needed to get the files to others.. upload, dvd mailing, blu ray, whatever.. and i have a post office close by so i can do express mail etc .. whatever is needed... 
</s><s>aside from that my personal goal is also to learn how to work wtih a group and fit in with the group in a way that i add as much value as i can without being into ego stuff.. like wanting to be some kinda control freak or loose cannon or whatever.. just kinda help in a group.... 
so, shooting using new camera, ninja thing , cs6 on pig ( no internet connection on pig but mouse has that )... might be a good start for me...

<s>when i was into that ms visual studio stuff and ms sql server ..</s><s> i looked into the mysql thing ( open source ) and what i really really liked about the ms sql svr. was the enterprise ui thing.. where you could make a sorta flow chart of your tables and links between fields in those tables...and it was way easy to change the parameters of the fields ( legal input etc )...</s><s> i am so out of that now... its been like 6 years since my foray into that asp.net junk, and playing with dreamweaver alternatives etc...

i honestly dont think there are that many pro people here ...</s><s> i listed about 8 names or 10 names earlier who i think are up to the level this would work for... but they are also busy making a living etc.. so... if it aint 'monetized' it may be a stupid thing to pursue for some ... 
i think we have to be prepared to realize everyone has their own agenda here.. as a 'hobby' and maybe a way to make money at the hobby.. but beyond that it is kinda iffy.... who knows.. anything can happen...

<s>i got idea for the subject of the 60 sec tv commercial for our project... and it is chicken ! 
</s><s>here is the back story.... 
</s><s>everyone knows that chickens are the backbone of the film business... 
</s><s>everyone knows that without chickens there would be no movies made anywhere in the world ! 
</s><s>if your call time is in the morning, you will be eating ( catering truck ---not to be confused with craft service ) eggs ...scrambled, breakfast burritos, omlet, etc .. some kinda egg thing is always the main thing..</s><s> ( cereal and oatmeal etc is not as popular as egg stuff ). 
</s><s>if your call time is in the afternoon...you will be eating chicken...</s><s> ( hamburgers are a big draw but chicken is king ). 
</s><s>and of course for dinner and supper etc.. it is chicken ...</s><s> ( fish, beef, pasta are always secondary to chicken in poplularity )... 
</s><s>so lets face it.. if it wasnt for chickens no movies would ever get made.... 
</s><s>this leads us to the catering jokes i love the most... 
</s><s>namely q: what came first, the chicken or the egg ?</s><s> a: depends on your call time 
q: why did the chicken cross the road ?</s><s> a: company move 


</s><s>chicken....</s><s> fuel your imagination !</s><s>

<s>yes, that ranch sounds like fun.</s><s> maybe i would have done better, to nix the idea of a "trout ranch," and concentrate on gun activities for women, maybe shooting and cooking the prairie grouses, or is that "grice?" 
</s><s>going back some years, i took several defensive handgun classes.</s><s> ninety-nine percent of the attendees were men, and most were in some area of criminal justice, or the military.</s><s> four years later, my wife took two of those classes, and the groups were about 25% female, with most just being everyday people, and only a couple in criminal justice.</s><s> the times were changing, even back in the late '80s and early '90s.</s><s> my partner, who was one of the principles of the school, allowed that the ladies were usually their best pupils, as they did not have any pre-conceived ideas about defensive handguns, and were there to seriously learn, rather than show off what they thought they knew.</s><s> some of the worst were those in "near" police situations, such as prison guards, and security personnel.</s><s> they mostly seemed to be ill-informed, and too full of "macho." now, the best students were "training officers" from rural departments.</s><s> even the training officers from metro departments were pretty poor, which was frightening. 
</s><s>because of her small stature, and her proficiency, my wife was featured in the intro video, as a real success story, showing that a small lady could efficiently handle a .</s><s>45acp semi.</s><s> for years, that video was the intro for even elite handgun classes, for the likes of several seal teams and delta force - though few of those students were female.</s><s> one day in san diego, a naval officer stopped my wife on the street, and asked, "pardon me, but aren't you the lady with the .</s><s>45 on a training video?" her answer was, "yes i am, and thank you for your service." 
i should have been able to see the "handwriting on the wall," and rather than try to affiliate with orvis, should have chosen benelli instead?</s><s> right now, blackberry farm is planning on adding one "girls only" shotgun event, and might need to add another.
