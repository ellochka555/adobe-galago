<s>hi again, thanks for the responses.</s><s> i guess my post was a bit of a loaded question.</s><s> i've been using director now for about 12+ years, and i've written 1-frame movies as well as totally score driven animations, as well as many apps that use both.</s><s> i believe each has its uses as different apps have very different specs.</s><s> i count both techniques as important and useful.</s><s> the trouble is, we have a developer that sees 1-frame movies as the nirvana of director coding.</s><s> as in, you start out using frame sequence animations, then build up to complete apps that use frames + behaviours and code, then once youve cut your teeth on those, you then move on to completely writing your games/apps/projects totally in code.</s><s> with not a single asset ever actually placed on the stage.</s><s> he sees having stuff on the stage as comforting and a habit that needs to be broken.</s><s> heres a quote of his: "multimedia developers start their careers with small apps, glorified powerpoint presentations with the stage and score used to modify graphics over time.</s><s> i have spent years doing this in my career and it was a hard habit to break, it is comforting to open an application and see something on stage.</s><s> as multimedia developers progress more and more control and complexity is required and large scripted runtime object models need to be implemented the developer moves away from reliance of the score and stage.</s><s> " my post on these forums, is to try to find a lingo authority(other than me), to try to convince him(and our bosses), that he is wrong in the sense that 'everything must be done in code at runtime'.</s><s> and the actual fact of the matter, is that sometimes, projects led themselves to stage apps, and sometimes to 1-frame development.</s><s> and to say outright that all projects from now on must be written all in code, is hamstringing yourself by reducing your options.</s><s> i need other support.</s><s> i am an expert lingo programmer with years of experience, but my opinion is just not having any effect.</s><s> i've tried searching in those places you mentioned mark, but its hard coming up with a well defined search term, without either getting 0 results, or thousands.</s><s> would any of you know of any discussions/books/literature that i could point him in the general direction of.</s><s> thanks again, glen

<s>i have always used a mixture of both.</s><s> my development experience is mostly games related, and my projects tend to go one of two way, either 2d or 3d.</s><s> for both, i generally use one frame for the actual gameplay loop.</s><s> for 2d games, i always use the score for sprites, on screen displays, level display etc. for example, a platformer: i would have one sprite which is the 'map viewport', displaying the currently visible portion of the map.</s><s> i have code running that updates this image based on the map data and player position.</s><s> collectables, baddies, particle systems, etc are then usually implemented with 'pools' of sprites which can be used and reused as necessary.</s><s> there's almost never a need to have a theoretically unlimited number of dynamically created sprites (which some people like), and having unused placeholder sprites waiting offstage incurrs practically no performance hit.</s><s> these all appear on one frame.</s><s> so, i might have 1 player sprite, 40 particle system sprites, 10 enemy sprites, all above the base 'map display' sprite.</s><s> the sprites in the 'enemy pool' are then used in turn to display any given enemy that is within the visible region.</s><s> for 3d games, it really has to all be in the code.</s><s> obviously the sprites metaphor doesn't apply and the best way is create and use parent scripts to represent your moving objects and systems within the world, so in my 3d games you'll often find only a single sprite on a single frame for the gameplay itself.</s><s> however...</s><s> (this bit may be of most interest to your developer), i always implement all the peripheral elements to the game in the score on other frames (either that, or in a flash movie embedded in the director move, which is pretty much the same for the purposes of this discussion).</s><s> very similar to your approach, i think.</s><s> this includes elements such as the title screen, instructions page, send to a friend screen, define keys, game over, level complete screen, etc. this is specifically the type of thing that the sprite/score/stage/behaviour system in director is designed for (and flash with its equivalent metaphors).</s><s> to ignore this and try and implement an application with any kind of graphical user interface is ridiculous.</s><s> does your developer also insist that all the graphic assets for his applications are created only by plotting pixels via code he's written himself?</s><s> should the sound effects be created from scratch by someone setting the individual bits of wav data one by one in a repeat loop?</s><s> why not?</s><s>... :-) so the score of my game movies tend to contain score-based animation and interactivity for all the parts of the movie which aren't part of the actual 'core game loop' itself, because that is what the score is designed for, and that is by far the quickest and most productive method of laying out and implementing a graphical interface with simple interactivity.</s><s> the game loop itself which features very complex interactivity takes one frame because that *is* the kind of code which fits a 1-frame approach.</s><s> however even within that 1 frame, you can choose to use multiple sprites, sprite pools, or dynamic sprites created on the fly, whichever is the best method for implementing the job in hand.</s><s> to tie yourself to a strict script-only approach of producing all applications is to really ignore the rest of the very useful tools at your disposal in director.</s><s> hope this helps! - ben

(or whatever terms those astronomers use) boatswain: <steps on deck and points at sun in sky> "there, sir." both are absolutely correct and answered the question.</s><s> which method is better?</s><s> did the captain care which method was used?</s><s> what if he wants to know where it will be 1 hour from now?</s><s> methinks one method will be better suited than the other to answer that question.</s><s> > experience, but my opinion is just not having any effect.</s><s> i've tried > searching in those places you mentioned mark, but its hard coming up > with a well defined search term, without either getting 0 results, or > thousands.</s><s> would any of you know of any discussions/books/literature > that i could point him in the general direction of.</s><s> hmm, maybe i'm recalling old lingo-l/direct-l/games-l mailing list discussions.</s><s> i've dropped out of those mailing lists, but i'm sure you can find links to them on the adobe director support pages.</s><s> direct-l has a good archive, but i think lingo-l's archive is defunct.</s><s> by all means, anybody still active on those lists, jump in with links here. -- mark a. boyd keep-on-learnin' :)

<s>well, which is it?</s><s> you contradict yourself: "i use 1 frame programming fairly often" or "though i generally use a sort of expanded version where there is more than 1 frame used.</s><s> " if i had to work on someone else's one frame, i would prefer to work on yours! :) i've been haveng to debug a previous programmer's actionscript lately, and there is not one line of comments in them, well except for where "trace" functions are commented out.</s><s> which this is this?</s><s> cheers, timm "mike blaustein" <mblaustein@gmail.com> wrote in message news:efj03e$ech$1@forums.macromedia.com...</s><s> >i disagree.</s><s> i use 1 frame programming fairly often, and as long as the >code is reasonably well documented, it isn't hard to get back to an old >project a year or more later.</s><s> i just make sure to comment every function i >write with the reason for it's existence, where it is normally used, the >input parameters and the outputs.</s><s> and when i use those functions, i >generally put in a comment explaining why it is used there.</s><s> it makes >tracing through the program fairly easy once you get used to it.</s><s> it is >never easy to jump into someone else's code, but if there is a documented >trail of how things work, it makes it a little easier.</s><s> > > though i generally use a sort of expanded version where there is more than > 1 frame used.</s><s> the program all happens in parent scripts, timing is done > using timeout objects, i generally have only one of any given type of > sprite (digital video, impressario, etc) that gets it's .filename changed > as needed.</s><s> if there are screens that need different backgrounds or have > wildly different interactive elements, then i'll jump to another frame > setup for that.</s><s> usually, there is a main menu screen with buttons to the > various other screens.</s><s> each of those will be on a different frame in > director.
