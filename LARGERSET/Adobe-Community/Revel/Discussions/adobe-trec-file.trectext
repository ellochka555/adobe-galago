<s>brian- 
</s><s>it appears that you do not have enough free memory on your device to upload using revel.</s><s> generally, we recommend a minimum of 500 mb free space for revel to function well. 
</s><s>you can manually clear the cache to free up some space by going to library info -> clear cache for each available library.</s><s> this removes full sized files that were cached during upload or editing, as well as the larger preview sizes. 
</s><s>although you can move revel to the sd card, the photos and videos still remain in the phone memory.</s><s> only the app is on the sd card.</s><s> a warning should appear when your available memory is <500mb. the cache is purged as needed to maintain 2 gb of free space in the device.

<s>to me, this seems to be very bad adaptation from ios apple phones.</s><s> even the newest android phones only have 2 gb ram on the phone itself, with the rest of the memory supplied by an sd card.</s><s> i'd have to remove most all of my apps just for the possibility that revel might work on my phone, and with the many baked in apps, there's still a very good chance i'd not come up with 500 mb, which is half my phone memory, to run revel.</s><s> i think it really needs to be coded to use sd memory if you want a functional android version of revel.</s><s> in the meantime i'll use ps touch though the file synchronizing in cc is another can of worms.</s><s> i'm thinking if ps touch is functional on my phone, revel should be functional as well.

<s>brian- 
</s><s>it appears that you do not have enough free memory on your device to upload using revel.</s><s> generally, we recommend a minimum of 500 mb free space for revel to function well. 
</s><s>you can manually clear the cache to free up some space by going to library info -> clear cache for each available library.</s><s> this removes full sized files that were cached during upload or editing, as well as the larger preview sizes. 
</s><s>although you can move revel to the sd card, the photos and videos still remain in the phone memory.</s><s> only the app is on the sd card.</s><s> a warning should appear when your available memory is <500mb. the cache is purged as needed to maintain 2 gb of free space in the device.

<s>to me, this seems to be very bad adaptation from ios apple phones.</s><s> even the newest android phones only have 2 gb ram on the phone itself, with the rest of the memory supplied by an sd card.</s><s> i'd have to remove most all of my apps just for the possibility that revel might work on my phone, and with the many baked in apps, there's still a very good chance i'd not come up with 500 mb, which is half my phone memory, to run revel.</s><s> i think it really needs to be coded to use sd memory if you want a functional android version of revel.</s><s> in the meantime i'll use ps touch though the file synchronizing in cc is another can of worms.</s><s> i'm thinking if ps touch is functional on my phone, revel should be functional as well. 
</s><s>okay, it does seem like newer android phones may have 16gb on phone memory.</s><s> i just don't happen to have one of those phones so i gues i'm sool.

<s>hi, 
</s><s>as you know that you can upload only 50 photos in a month now, in case you have uploaded 50 photos from revel online app in this month then you would not be able to upload more photos from elements 12.</s><s> if you have photos upload limit still available, and you are having hundred of photos still in eo, they will be uploaded in batches of 50 every month.</s><s> if you are facing issues, please try restarting your revel agent.</s><s> you can do this by: < win: ctrl+k > adobe revel mac : cmd+k > adobe revel > here you will find a revel agent button, mark it off >ok go back to preferences again, switch it on > please let me know if you still have doubts.

<s>anwesha, thanks you for responding to my question.</s><s> my unlimited upload period ended in january and that was the last time that a photo uploaded.</s><s> i currently have several hundred photos remaining in my mobile albums inside of elements 12 organizer waiting to upload to revel.</s><s> i have stopped and started the adobe revel agent numerous times.</s><s> basically nothing happens.</s><s> i have also tried clicking on the revel agent icon.</s><s> when i do this it displays a message "detecting changes" and then a message telling me everything is up to date.</s><s> when i log onto my adobe revel account online there is an option to add 50 photos, but it appears that i must manual select them from my hard drive which bypasses the purpose of the elements organizer mobile albums.</s><s> do you have any other suggestions?</s><s> thanks, robert

<s>robert , Ê ideally the photos should get uploaded from organizer as well if you upload limit still available.</s><s> can you please try one more thing: if you know which photos in your mobile album are still not uploaded and are there on your hard disk, please delete them from your catalog and mark them again for upload.</s><s> please donot mark all the <hundreds> photos for upload, try it with only <50 for now and see if it works.

<s>anwesha, thanks for the additional suggestion, but i had already tried that.</s><s> i removed several photos from my mobile albums and then added them back in hopes of inspiring the program to do something.</s><s> i also found a couple of non-jpg photo file types that i inadvertently placed in the catalog (psds).</s><s> i removed those as well hoping that they might have been holding things up.</s><s> that didn't help either.</s><s> at this point i'm about to delete my revel account and look for another option.</s><s> i find it sad that adobe has no direct support for their products and their customers are required to rely on each other for support.</s><s> i have wasted numerous hours on this issue.

<s>hi pattie f~ 
</s><s>thanks for replying.</s><s> the answer to your question is no. the file(s) i am loading is(are) brand-new jpeg file(s) that have never before been added the any of my revel albums.</s><s> at first i tried to upload a batch of about 50 jpegs from my pc to a new revel album.</s><s> 39 uploaded, and the rest failed.</s><s> i re-tried the remaining 11, and 1 or 2 finally uploaded to that same album after repeated (10-15) attempts.</s><s> the last 9 or 10 will not upload and have been getting the "duplicate" error message.</s><s> they are all jpegs, photos taken in the middle of a larger sequence.</s><s> when repeated tries still failed, i took all of the actions i posted above (rebooting, logging out and back in again, alternating browsers, trying to upload to a different revel album, editing the photos and saving them with a different file name, clearing the cache, etc.</s><s>).</s><s> interestingly enough, after i cleared the cache, i no longer received the "duplicate" error message, but the files will still not upload.</s><s> when i try a new and different jpeg file, other than the ones that have repeatedly failed, they have uploaded with about a 25% success rate.</s><s> i have clicked the "i" inside the error message, and i agree that the file that is listed is the file that is not uploading, as i am now resorting to trying to upload them one at a time. 
</s><s>please note that i upload only jpeg file types, and i place any given photo in only one revel album.</s><s> i do not upload raw files, nor do i use a single photo in multiple albums.</s><s> there should be absolutely no duplicate issue.</s><s> nor are the jpegs i am trying to upload corrupt.</s><s> they display perfectly well on my pc, on my ipad, etc. 
</s><s>also, please note that i have been creating albums and uploading jpegs since all my cloud photos were transferred from photoshop.com to adoberevel.com.</s><s> i have never had even one glitch whatsoever up until as recently as the first week of december 2013. everything has loaded quickly, with 100% success rate.</s><s> i am not having any issues with my internet connection.

<s>hi pattie f~

</s><s>please note that i upload only jpeg file types, and i place any given photo in only one revel album.</s><s> i do not upload raw files, nor do i use a single photo in multiple albums.</s><s> there should be absolutely no duplicate issue.</s><s> nor are the jpegs i am trying to upload corrupt.</s><s> they display perfectly well on my pc, on my ipad, etc. 
</s><s>also, please note that i have been creating albums and uploading jpegs since all my cloud photos were transferred from photoshop.com to adoberevel.com.</s><s> i have never had even one glitch whatsoever up until as recently as the first week of december 2013. everything has loaded quickly, with 100% success rate.</s><s> i am not having any issues with my internet connection.
