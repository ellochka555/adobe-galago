<s>@ uwe: got it, thanks! 
@ silkrooster: this worked pretty well actually!</s><s> i did notice in the bridge i could not load the selected images into camera raw using ctrl-r because the images were in .png format, but once i converted them to .jpg, it worked pretty well. 
i did everything like you said and used the full vertical and horizontal align.</s><s> unfortunately, it does miss a few, or in some cases, turn a straight image crooked and distorted.</s><s> which means i have to use another program to cycle through every image and manually fix the ones that didn't deskew correctly.</s><s> but it only seems like 1 in 50 are that messed up. 
i did notice a couple of other small things that i can live with but are kind of strange: 
1) it slightly recolored every image as it deskewed them (not sure if it's an improvement or not) 2) it seems to distort more than rotate.</s><s> for instance, an image may be aligned to the image borders vertically on the left and right, but still crooked on the top and bottom, which shouldn't be possible with perfect rectangles like my trading cards. 
</s><s>that being said, this process will still take less time than it would to manually straighten them as they are being cropped, so thank you very much for that! 
</s><s>now i still need to make a template for my scanner to scan at fixed positions.</s><s> once that is done, i will reply with a scanned image to figure out how to batch crop eight images each out of multiple scans.

1) it slightly recolored every image as it deskewed them (not sure if it's an improvement or not) 2) it seems to distort more than rotate.</s><s> for instance, an image may be aligned to the image borders vertically on the left and right, but still crooked on the top and bottom, which shouldn't be possible with perfect rectangles like my trading cards. 
</s><s>that being said, this process will still take less time than it would to manually straighten them as they are being cropped, so thank you very much for that! 
</s><s>now i still need to make a template for my scanner to scan at fixed positions.</s><s> once that is done, i will reply with a scanned image to figure out how to batch crop eight images each out of multiple scans.

</s><s>so basically, i routinely scan large stacks of sports cards (500+) in precise order (card names are in stack order in a spreadsheet).</s><s> i scan 8 cards at a time in solft plastic sleeves and usually end up with 70+ large images. 
i would like to be able to take all those large scan images, create a new folder where they are saved, and crop all the individual cards and save them in the new folder using the file names provided in the spreadsheet. 
</s><s>another problem is that many cards are scanned slightly skewed in various directions and degrees.</s><s> it would be great if they could be automatically aligned with the borders of the image. 
</s><s>the 'straighten and crop' feature in ps did not crop the cards well enough.</s><s> it only separated 2/8 cards and left 6/8 in one scan, for a total of 3 scans rather than 8.</s><s> it may or may not have straightened some of the skewed images, but i couldn't really tell.

<s>the penny sleeves could be part of the problem, but they are so close to the actual card border...</s><s> i'm talking 2px.</s><s> plus, i have to scan them in sleeves.</s><s> when i first started doing this i didn't use sleeves and it caused damage to the cards when taking them on and off the scanner, so i always use sleeves when handling them. 
</s><s>as for changing the background and not the cards, i'm not sure how to do that.</s><s> i was messing with the quick selection tool and actually got it to trace around the borders of each card.</s><s> i then used the select->constrain tool to widen the borders around the cards by about 20px. which is odd, because when i used the select->enlarge tool it pushed the card borders in 20px. 
i still want to be able to do all these actions in bulk somehow though, not one at a time.</s><s> i could use paint.net and a macro recorder like i've been doing if i have to do it one at a time. 
</s><s>what if i started scanning the cards with a template around them to keep them in the same exact position for every scan?</s><s> is there a script or something to crop out eight fixed position images and save them in order sequentially?</s><s> it doesn't even have to straighten the images or save the filenames with the spreadsheet names. 
</s><s>although i will still have to figure out how to straighten the individual card images in bulk.</s><s> most cards are skewed less than a degree and up to 10 degrees in either direction, so a single rotation value will not work.</s><s> somehow, it needs to detect that the image border is the ruler and the card border needs to match it.

<s>1) i recommend that both of you contact the forum administrator about this issue and change your passwords.</s><s> it looks like either the site was hacked or a bug cropped up.</s><s> frankly i am prefering the later, much easier to fix. 
2) @ portlander_cards, to access the camera raw dialog box, you have a few choices.</s><s> depending on how you start with your image and preference.</s><s> you can in bridge select your image(s) {more than one can be selected} then press ctrl-r or cmd-r depending on if you are on a windows or mac system.</s><s> in photoshop you can open a raw image which will load the image into camera raw first.</s><s> in photoshop you can select open as then select camera raw as the type then the file name.</s><s> in photoshop cc and higher, you can select the image layer then in the filters select camera raw. 
</s><s>camera raw supports png, tiff and jpg.</s><s> camera raw filter has no limitation since the file is already loaded into photoshop therefore the file format is irrelevent. 
</s><s>in camera raw, you set the auto rotation option.</s><s> select the 6th tab (lens correction) then select the manual tab.</s><s> in this panel you have four choices - 
auto level vertical level/perspective full (level, vertical and horizonal)

</s><s>camera raw supports png, tiff and jpg.</s><s> camera raw filter has no limitation since the file is already loaded into photoshop therefore the file format is irrelevent. 
</s><s>in camera raw, you set the auto rotation option.</s><s> select the 6th tab (lens correction) then select the manual tab.</s><s> in this panel you have four choices - 
auto level vertical level/perspective full (level, vertical and horizonal)

<s>@ uwe: got it, thanks! 
@ silkrooster: this worked pretty well actually!</s><s> i did notice in the bridge i could not load the selected images into camera raw using ctrl-r because the images were in .png format, but once i converted them to .jpg, it worked pretty well. 
i did everything like you said and used the full vertical and horizontal align.</s><s> unfortunately, it does miss a few, or in some cases, turn a straight image crooked and distorted.</s><s> which means i have to use another program to cycle through every image and manually fix the ones that didn't deskew correctly.</s><s> but it only seems like 1 in 50 are that messed up. 
i did notice a couple of other small things that i can live with but are kind of strange: 
1) it slightly recolored every image as it deskewed them (not sure if it's an improvement or not) 2) it seems to distort more than rotate.</s><s> for instance, an image may be aligned to the image borders vertically on the left and right, but still crooked on the top and bottom, which shouldn't be possible with perfect rectangles like my trading cards. 
</s><s>that being said, this process will still take less time than it would to manually straighten them as they are being cropped, so thank you very much for that! 
</s><s>now i still need to make a template for my scanner to scan at fixed positions.</s><s> once that is done, i will reply with a scanned image to figure out how to batch crop eight images each out of multiple scans.

@ silkrooster: this worked pretty well actually!</s><s> i did notice in the bridge i could not load the selected images into camera raw using ctrl-r because the images were in .png format, but once i converted them to .jpg, it worked pretty well.

<s>i am new to photoshop!</s><s> i started a free trial today and would probably buy it if i can get it to do what i need.</s><s> i have also spent hours searching the forums, google, and downloading many other imaging programs with absolutely no luck.</s><s> please be very specific because my mind is already cluttered from this and all the other work i have to do and all the other things i've had to learn over the years.</s><s> thanks!</s><s> 
</s><s>so basically, i routinely scan large stacks of sports cards (500+) in precise order (card names are in stack order in a spreadsheet).</s><s> i scan 8 cards at a time in solft plastic sleeves and usually end up with 70+ large images. 
i would like to be able to take all those large scan images, create a new folder where they are saved, and crop all the individual cards and save them in the new folder using the file names provided in the spreadsheet. 
</s><s>another problem is that many cards are scanned slightly skewed in various directions and degrees.</s><s> it would be great if they could be automatically aligned with the borders of the image. 
</s><s>the 'straighten and crop' feature in ps did not crop the cards well enough.</s><s> it only separated 2/8 cards and left 6/8 in one scan, for a total of 3 scans rather than 8.</s><s> it may or may not have straightened some of the skewed images, but i couldn't really tell.

<s>@ uwe: got it, thanks! 
@ silkrooster: this worked pretty well actually!</s><s> i did notice in the bridge i could not load the selected images into camera raw using ctrl-r because the images were in .png format, but once i converted them to .jpg, it worked pretty well. 
i did everything like you said and used the full vertical and horizontal align.</s><s> unfortunately, it does miss a few, or in some cases, turn a straight image crooked and distorted.</s><s> which means i have to use another program to cycle through every image and manually fix the ones that didn't deskew correctly.</s><s> but it only seems like 1 in 50 are that messed up.

</s><s>that being said, this process will still take less time than it would to manually straighten them as they are being cropped, so thank you very much for that!

1) it slightly recolored every image as it deskewed them (not sure if it's an improvement or not) 2) it seems to distort more than rotate.</s><s> for instance, an image may be aligned to the image borders vertically on the left and right, but still crooked on the top and bottom, which shouldn't be possible with perfect rectangles like my trading cards. 
</s><s>that being said, this process will still take less time than it would to manually straighten them as they are being cropped, so thank you very much for that! 
</s><s>now i still need to make a template for my scanner to scan at fixed positions.</s><s> once that is done, i will reply with a scanned image to figure out how to batch crop eight images each out of multiple scans. 
</s><s>thank you so much!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s> happy new year!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s>
