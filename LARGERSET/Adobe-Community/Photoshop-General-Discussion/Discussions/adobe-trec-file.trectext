<s>hello!</s><s> 

</s><s>i've just got my self new lisence for adobe lightroom, ps cc & cs6.</s><s> previously i had just ps cs5.</s><s> problem is that i can't get ps cs6 nor ps cc to start up, or more accurately to stay on more than one second.</s><s> now i'm asking help to get just the cs6 to work, as when that problem is solved, i believe also the cc -problem is solved too, as the problem is excatly the same.</s><s> lightroom works fine. 
</s><s>what happens when i now start up cs6; everything loads just fine, no errors or anything that is abnormal.</s><s> at first time when i started cs6, i got a warning message (this is a translation from finnish to english so it might not be to the letter): "photoshop detected graphic cards that are not officially supported.</s><s> if there are problems, remove the selection from settings, performance settings - use graphics processor".</s><s> i haven't seen this message later (except when i tried cs6 with different windows account). 
</s><s>when cs6 (or cc) is started there's time about one second to open a menu window, when a window is succesfully opened the program stays on, and i can use any menu window that i want, and i can change any options.</s><s> right after menus are closed, the program closes.</s><s> mysterious.</s><s> but, because of that, i'm able to go to the "performance settings" and try different selections - i've tried deselect the "use gpu", and i've tried to use all of the advanced settings (basic, normal, advanced), but the "use opencl" choise is allways grayed out, and i'm not able to select that.</s><s> also cs6 detects my gpu right. 
i thing this has something to do with gpu as the above message says, i just don't know what to try anymore. 
</s><s>now what have i tried and what's done (using admin rights): - updated both nvidia gpu drivers (three different drivers been tried) and intell drivers - installation and removing - removed ps cs5 - used adobe cleaning tool - used two differend registry cleaning tools (cc cleaner / wise cleaner) before installations - used shift when starting - disabled the gpu sniffer - tried logging out from creative cloud - deleted fntcache.dat from /system32 - tried different 3d settings from nvidia control panel only for the photoshop.exe (tried forcing nvidia gpu, tried different cuda gpu settings

<s>i hope somebody can help as i'm at my wits end.</s><s> i started getting kernel panics on my 7 month old imac about 10 days ago.</s><s> these only happen when using photoshop.</s><s> i have tried numerous tests with apple over the past week but have not found the cause as yet.</s><s> i am using the latest version of mavericks and the latest cc update.</s><s> i tried using just illustrator yesterday for a while and my machine was fine.</s><s> last week i was working on fairly simple files in ps and it was having kernel panics about once an hour.</s><s> now though, i'm working on a very detailed illustration (over 600mb - lots of layers and groups) and it's having kernel panics every 15 minutes.</s><s> i have tried several things with adobe live chat technical support and even tried using ps in another user account but all to no avail - still getting the kernel panics.</s><s> is it something specific in ps that is causing these or is it my imac?i have read on other threads that ps can't cause these but i'm at a loss as to what to do now.</s><s> i'm struggling to get any work done because of it.</s><s> i have lots of crash reports if i need to post them?</s><s> any help would be gratefully received.</s><s> thanks in advance.

<s>first thing you need to know: kernel panics cannot be caused by applications, ever.</s><s> kernel panics (and bluescreens on windows) can only be caused by defects in the os, bugs in low level drivers, and hardware problems. 
</s><s>this particular panic appears to occur in the graphics driver code.</s><s> photoshop was running at the time, but this appears to be some problem in the hardware interface with the graphics card - could be hardware or software. 
</s><s>again, this is not caused by photoshop.</s><s> it is just that photoshop was running when the graphics hardware had a fault.</s><s> the apple techs should be passing this to the apple os team, and any who blame photoshop should be reported to their manager for a lack of training.

<s>first thing you need to know: kernel panics cannot be caused by applications, ever.</s><s> kernel panics (and bluescreens on windows) can only be caused by defects in the os, bugs in low level drivers, and hardware problems. 
</s><s>this particular panic appears to occur in the graphics driver code.</s><s> photoshop was running at the time, but this appears to be some problem in the hardware interface with the graphics card - could be hardware or software. 
</s><s>again, this is not caused by photoshop.</s><s> it is just that photoshop was running when the graphics hardware had a fault.</s><s> the apple techs should be passing this to the apple os team, and any who blame photoshop should be reported to their manager for a lack of training.

<s>my goodness ann.</s><s> i'd loooooove to\have a go at that, but i am\stuck on my laptop for a couple of days while rebuilding my main system.</s><s> there is soooo much you could do. 
</s><s>the only way i can think of to actually turn the street lights off with photoshop, is to take a photograph of the city official in charge of that sort of thing, and composite him/her into a compromising situation.</s><s> i feel they would turn those lights off for you to avoid a scandal. 
</s><s>to photoshop away the lights, look for another image with cars in a low light situation, but with their lights off, and either composite the front of the car onto your picture, or use it as a guide to paint out the lights free hand.</s><s> i'd use a combination of both.</s><s> the lights flare beyond the normal outline of the headlamps etc. so you'd have fix the car hoods (i almost said bonnet) as well. 
</s><s>what else do you have in mind?</s><s> i'd hit google images for something like 'war sky' and composite that behind the buildings.</s><s> same thing for a big crater in the road.</s><s> find an image of an arial view of a car, and composite the front half inside your new crater.</s><s> wow, this could be fun.

<s>hi, i hope this is not a stupid question.</s><s> i saw a lot of tutorials and explanations about turning on lights, simulating car lights and turning day to night.</s><s> but what i need is to turn off lights in my picture, i have some streetlights, some cars and traffic lights.</s><s> i need to make a disaster in the photo for a project for my university.</s><s> the teacher doesnt know how to do it... and tells us to simply eraser all the streetlights and traffic lights and fill the background.</s><s> i want to learn how to turn lights off because i think its more proffessional and the streetlights and traffic lights are very important to make a more realistic effect.</s><s> i dont know if this is possible to make, but if it is, could someone explain me how to do it?</s><s> i would appreciate it much,+ 
thanks 
pd: im adding the picture, in my progress, just to let you know what im trying to show you, thanks.</s><s> i know i have a lot of work to do to soft the sky.
