<post author="Pattie F" timestamp="May 10, 2012 7:17 PM">
<s>photoshop cs6 gpu faq     introduction this document provides a quick reference guide to video card usage in photoshop.  some features require a compatible video card to work; if the video card or its driver is defective or unsupported, those features will not work at all.  other features use the video card for acceleration and if the card or driver is defective those features will run more slowly.   mercury graphics engine the mercury graphics engine (mge) represents features that use video card, or gpu, acceleration.</s><s> in photoshop cs6, this new engine delivers near-instant
