<s>1) how do i load pre-existing videos/audio to a project's working timeline? 
</s></quote>
</s><s>can you elaborate a bit more on this one, as i am not quite sure what you wish to do? 

<quote>
<s>2) which lines do i specifically use to post audio and video on (soundtrack, narration, audio 1, video 1, audio 2, video 2, audio 3, and video 3)? 
</s></quote>
</s><s>you can use any of the audio tracks, that are empty.</s><s> however, there have been some odd behaviors in earlier versions of pre, regarding the two fixed audio tracks, soundtrack and narration.</s><s> in most of those cases, the "fix" was to select and drag the audio clips from one of those, to any free regular audio track.</s><s> note that if an empty audio track does not exist in the timeline, you can create one (or as many as you need, up to about 99). 

<quote>
<s>3) how do i cut video/audio parts on the timeline? 
</s></quote>
</s><s>there are a couple of ways to cut the audio and/or video.</s><s> one is to use the razor/scissors tool, and if you have the cti (current time indicator/playhead) where you want to cut, and snap is on, then the razor/scissors tool will snap to that point, when you get close to it. 
</s><s>next, and again with the cti positioned, where you want the cut, you can hit ctrl+k, to cut the clip(s). 
</s><s>if you only want to cut, say the video, or audio, then alt+click on that stream in a muxed clip.</s><s> that will temporarily unlink the audio from the video, so that cuts can be made to just one stream. 

<quote>
<s>4) what does the sceneline do different from the timeline? 
</s></quote>
</s><s>the sceneline view is sort of like a "lightbox," for general, quick sorting of clips, but is very limited for actual editing.</s><s> most recommend that after the initial sorting, one switch to the timeline view, for exact editing.</s><s> also, the sceneline view only shows one track on the actual timeline, so its view is limited. 

<quote>
<s>5) how do i add video/audio transistions to parts on the timeline? 
</s></quote>
</s><s>it is probably easiest to just drag the transition from the transitions panel display, to where one want it to fit, between clips.</s><s> now is probably a good point to read this article on handles, as they are important to get most transitions to function properly. 

<quote>
<s>6) how do i mark where the end to the timeline video/audio-list is established, for the final video/audio or audio file? 
</s></quote>
</s><s>this happens automatically, as one adds clips.</s><s> the timeline just increases as the duration (runtime of all clips on the timeline) increases. 
</s><s>the only time that one needs to even consider this is with the wab (work area bar).</s><s> if it has been set to a smaller portion of the timeline, and then clips are added, one needs to manually extend the wab to cover those additional clips, if needed.</s><s> the easiest way to do that is to hit the \ (backslash key), to zoom out, and then dbl-click the little box in the middle of the wab.</s><s> if the wab has not been set to a smaller portion of the timeline, then it automatically extends also. 

<quote>
<s>7) how do i make my finished project into a video/audio file or just audio? 
</s></quote>
</s><s>as of about pre 7, all file exporting is done from the share tab.</s><s> be sure, when viewing the share panel, that you look at the scroll bars to the right, as they will access more options.</s><s> in most formats, one can share to an audio file, a video file, or a muxed audio & video file.

</s><s>driver that works: 320.49 (1 july 2013).</s><s> you can find this driver at: http://www.nvidia.com/download/find.aspx?lang=en-us. 
</s><s>this is actually a windows 8 driver.</s><s> the 8.1 drivers i tested exhibited the following problems in adobe premiere elements 10: 1.</s><s> audio only when previewing a video.</s><s> 2. audio only when attempting to play a video from the time-line.</s><s> 3. if i applied an edit to the time-line video (brightness/contrast) or used video merge, it would work.</s><s> however, that is no way to build a timelapse using thousands of pictures.</s><s> 4. occasionally i would notice a memory error when shutting down the computer. 
</s><s>switching to the oldest windows 8 gt 640 driver (310.19) cleared the error.</s><s> but also crashed during the rendering of 1100 photos. 
</s><s>the oldest windows 8.1 driver (326.19) has the same problem as the most current (331.82) drivers, as listed above.

<s>success, i think i had a chance to go back and test some older drivers.</s><s> the preview screen is now working properly.</s><s> when playing a video in the viewer (upper left screen) i get both audio and video.

</s><s>this is actually a windows 8 driver.</s><s> the 8.1 drivers i tested exhibited the following problems in adobe premiere elements 10: 1.</s><s> audio only when previewing a video.</s><s> 2. audio only when attempting to play a video from the time-line.</s><s> 3. if i applied an edit to the time-line video (brightness/contrast) or used video merge, it would work.</s><s> however, that is no way to build a timelapse using thousands of pictures.</s><s> 4. occasionally i would notice a memory error when shutting down the computer. 
</s><s>switching to the oldest windows 8 gt 640 driver (310.19) cleared the error.</s><s> but also crashed during the rendering of 1100 photos. 
</s><s>the oldest windows 8.1 driver (326.19) has the same problem as the most current (331.82) drivers, as listed above.

<s>hi everyone, 
after getting some hints from you about the possible cause of this error, i have been able to fix my project and i'd like to give you back my insights... 
</s><s>first, i uploaded the project file in the windows editor.</s><s> by comparing the file to an earlier backup version which worked fine, i found the following: at one point in time pe10 corrupts the .prel file by inserting "," in decimal numbers instead of the required "." for the <startkeyframe> as well as for the <keyframes> tags.</s><s> the correct syntax of both these tags seems to be as follows: 
<startkeyframe>-xxxx,yyyy,0,0,z.,z.,z.,z.</startkeyframe> <keyframes>-xxxx,yyyy,0,0,z.,z.,z.,z.</keyframes> 
xxxx is a 17 digit (integer) number yyyy is either a (decimal) number z. or a range z.:z. or a boolean value (true or false) z. is a decimal number (number followed by a ".") 
</s><s>in my corrupted .prel file, all numbers which were supposed to be "z." were actually "z," which caused the error.</s><s> only some of the occurrences of this error can be captured by the script described above, namely replacing the "," followed by 12 or 24 "0" with a ".".</s><s> unfortunately, there are a lot of other occurencences which have to be dealt with in order to correct the .prel file.</s><s> one can get a number of algorithms for speeding up the process of replacing the erroneous "," with ".", e.g. search for ",000000" and replace it by ".</s><s>000000" (similar to the scipt above) but you also have to consider search for ",," and replace it by ".," search for "0,5" and replace it by "0.5", search for ",<" and replace it by ".</s><s>< etc., you get the idea.... 
</s><s>this list is not complete, you still have to search manually for some odd numbers!</s><s>!</s><s> however, as you progress with replacing the erroneous "," you will see the perceantage of the .prel file loading successfully increase and at the end of the day (more an hour really) the file will load completely.</s><s> i have not tried to fully automate the process.</s><s> hope this was a one time effort! 
</s><s>the above procedure is a pain in the neck, but if your son has spent an entire weekend on a project it is worth the effort!</s><s> hope this will work for you as well.</s><s> adobe should be able to fix this easily.</s><s> good luck!

<s>hi rainer, 
</s><s>that's it - everything is working...</s><s> what have i done? 
i used both (!</s><s>!</s><s>) scripts from cloud565 with the following command lines via cmd:

note: c:\perl64 is the install path of pearl, we.prel is the damaged existing initial project.</s><s> we1 and we2 are going to be created by the script.

search for ,< and replace by .</s><s>< search for 0,5 and replaxe by 0.5

<s>ok, quick question: as pre will continue doing autosaves, while you edit, so that with a long session, if something has gone wrong early, the older autosaves will have likely been overwritten - on the prel files, do any date from back when things worked well?</s><s> if so, and as you say, they are also showing problems, my question would be, what has changed with the system, from the time that things worked, until now?</s><s> have you added any new software, or hardware?</s><s> have you reconfigured anything that you can think of?

<s>hi everyone, 
after getting some hints from you about the possible cause of this error, i have been able to fix my project and i'd like to give you back my insights... 
</s><s>first, i uploaded the project file in the windows editor.</s><s> by comparing the file to an earlier backup version which worked fine, i found the following: at one point in time pe10 corrupts the .prel file by inserting "," in decimal numbers instead of the required "." for the <startkeyframe> as well as for the <keyframes> tags.</s><s> the correct syntax of both these tags seems to be as follows:

xxxx is a 17 digit (integer) number yyyy is either a (decimal) number z. or a range z.:z. or a boolean value (true or false) z. is a decimal number (number followed by a ".") 
</s><s>in my corrupted .prel file, all numbers which were supposed to be "z." were actually "z," which caused the error.</s><s> only some of the occurrences of this error can be captured by the script described above, namely replacing the "," followed by 12 or 24 "0" with a ".".</s><s> unfortunately, there are a lot of other occurencences which have to be dealt with in order to correct the .prel file.</s><s> one can get a number of algorithms for speeding up the process of replacing the erroneous "," with ".", e.g. search for ",000000" and replace it by ".</s><s>000000" (similar to the scipt above) but you also have to consider search for ",," and replace it by ".," search for "0,5" and replace it by "0.5", search for ",<" and replace it by ".</s><s>< etc., you get the idea.... 
</s><s>this list is not complete, you still have to search manually for some odd numbers!</s><s>!</s><s> however, as you progress with replacing the erroneous "," you will see the perceantage of the .prel file loading successfully increase and at the end of the day (more an hour really) the file will load completely.</s><s> i have not tried to fully automate the process.</s><s> hope this was a one time effort!

<s>hi rainer,

<s>aardga 
glad that worked for you. 
</s><s>the selective audio export is not difficult, but you need to remember to do the two parts...the placement of the gray tabs of the work bar area in the timeline area as well placement of check mark next to the "share work area bar only" in the export setting. 
</s><s>the timeline phase will look like this 

</s><s>you can set those gray tabs to span the segment that you want to export a. moving them into place with the mouse course or b. moving the timeline indicator to the start of the segment, then as you hold down the alt key of the computer main keyboard, press the left bracket key [ and then after that moving the timeline indicator to the end of the segment, then as you hold down the alt key, press the right bracket key ]

<s>the motion property options are position, scale, constrain proportions, rotation, anchor point, or anti-flicker filter.</s><s> the opacity choice is just opacity. 
</s></quote>keyframing of these properties are reflected as white dots on the clip's rubberband and can be adjusted at that level. 
</s><s>if you do not see the white dots keyframes in the clip's rubberband, then right click the file, select "show clip keyframes", follow to motion and opacity, pick one, and follow to find your property named, and select it. 
</s><s>at the rubberband level, right clicking a keyframe (white dot) there, offers opportunities for linear, bezier, auto bezier, continous bezier, hold, ease in, ease out, and delete.</s><s> if you select bezier, do you see the keyframe handles? 
i have not done this, but you might want to see how much of the following you can get done in premiere elements using the final cut description of "smoothing keyframes with bezier hangles". https://documentation.apple.com/en/finalcutpro/usermanual/index.html#c hapter=67%26section=2%26tasks=true

</s><s>by default, the video clip set is for opacity and the audio clip set is for volume.</s><s> once set, with your mouse cursor, you can drag the "rubberband" (orange line running horizontally across the clip) up or down to change the opacity from 100% to 0% or change volume from 0 db to increase the sound above or below the volume that the audio was originally recorded at. 
</s><s>this feature has no exclusive ties to pip (picture in picture).</s><s> what is the pip guide to which you refer in your post?

<s>pcnovicemesa 
</s><s>often in premiere elements there are more than one way to do the same thing.</s><s> often the user feels one way is quicker and easier than the other.</s><s> many users consider making adjustments at the clip's rubberband level are quicker and easier than alterntives.</s><s> the following will go to this point for each of opacity and motion rotation for the video portion of a clip. 
</s><s>opacity (the opacity settings range from 0 to 100% with 100% as the default no matter where you are going to adjust the opacity). 
</s><s>at rubberband level 
</s><s>when you import your clip with opacity set in the title of the clip, the rubberband represents opacity the opacity level is at 100% its location is shown toward the top of the clip. if you drag the rubberband downward with the mouse curse, you lower the opacity anywhere from 100 to 0%. 
</s><s>now i dragged the rubberband from its 100% opacity downward and stopped at 33.33%.</s><s> i know that because, while i am dragging the rubberband downward there is a readout toward the bottom of the clip for the level of the opacity.</s><s> see next screenshot. 

</s><s>knowing what the opacity range is 0 to 100% and watching the opacity reading as i move the rubberband up or down gives me control of the situation. 
</s><s>at applied effect tab/applied effects palette/opacity panel expanded 
</s><s>i can get the exact same results by moving the opacity slider from 100% to 0.</s><s> i do not have to be bother with the rubberband way and vice versa.</s><s> the topper is, when i do the opacity set in rubberband area, the opacity slider in the applied effects moves to whatever i set at the rubberband level.</s><s> and, if i do the opacity set in the applied effects, the rubberband moves accordingly at the same time. 
</s><s>motion rotation 
</s><s>at rubberband level 
</s><s>when you import your clip with motion rotation set in the title of the clip the rubberband represents motion rotation 
the motion rotation level is at 0 x 0.0 degrees (note that motion rotation rubberband has its own start level) its location is shown toward the bottom of the clip if you raise the rubberband above 0 x 0.0, you rotate the clip to the right; if you lower the rubberband below 0 x 0.0, you rotate the clip to the left. the rubberband reading seen in the timeline is -91x-8.0 when the rubberband is dragged to is lowest level and 90x7.0 when raised to its highest level. 
</s><s>rubberband 0 x 0.0 level default 
rubberband 91 x 7.0 level when dragged all the way to top of clip 

</s><s>the point here is that, while you are dragging the rubberband up or down, you should be seeing the corresponding reading for the property at the different level of the rubberband.</s><s> do you see the 91 x 7.0 in the screenshot immediately above? 
i am going to stop here for now and not go into a comparison of rotation when set in applied effects tab route. 
</s><s>my recommendation for now, if you want to rotate the clip for orientation purposes (one that imports sideward - some cell phone users especially run into this) a. right click the clip and select rotate 90 left or rotate 90 right 
please let me know if this supplemental information help any.</s><s> and, what are the current matters that still need clarification.

<s>pcnovicemesa 
</s><s>often in premiere elements there are more than one way to do the same thing.</s><s> often the user feels one way is quicker and easier than the other.</s><s> many users consider making adjustments at the clip's rubberband level are quicker and easier than alterntives.</s><s> the following will go to this point for each of opacity and motion rotation for the video portion of a clip. 
</s><s>opacity (the opacity settings range from 0 to 100% with 100% as the default no matter where you are going to adjust the opacity). 
</s><s>at rubberband level 
</s><s>when you import your clip with opacity set in the title of the clip, the rubberband represents opacity the opacity level is at 100% its location is shown toward the top of the clip. if you drag the rubberband downward with the mouse curse, you lower the opacity anywhere from 100 to 0%. 
</s><s>now i dragged the rubberband from its 100% opacity downward and stopped at 33.33%.</s><s> i know that because, while i am dragging the rubberband downward there is a readout toward the bottom of the clip for the level of the opacity.</s><s> see next screenshot. 

</s><s>knowing what the opacity range is 0 to 100% and watching the opacity reading as i move the rubberband up or down gives me control of the situation. 
</s><s>at applied effect tab/applied effects palette/opacity panel expanded 
</s><s>i can get the exact same results by moving the opacity slider from 100% to 0.</s><s> i do not have to be bother with the rubberband way and vice versa.</s><s> the topper is, when i do the opacity set in rubberband area, the opacity slider in the applied effects moves to whatever i set at the rubberband level.</s><s> and, if i do the opacity set in the applied effects, the rubberband moves accordingly at the same time. 
</s><s>motion rotation 
</s><s>at rubberband level 
</s><s>when you import your clip with motion rotation set in the title of the clip the rubberband represents motion rotation 
the motion rotation level is at 0 x 0.0 degrees (note that motion rotation rubberband has its own start level) its location is shown toward the bottom of the clip if you raise the rubberband above 0 x 0.0, you rotate the clip to the right; if you lower the rubberband below 0 x 0.0, you rotate the clip to the left. the rubberband reading seen in the timeline is -91x-8.0 when the rubberband is dragged to is lowest level and 90x7.0 when raised to its highest level. 
</s><s>rubberband 0 x 0.0 level default 
rubberband 91 x 7.0 level when dragged all the way to top of clip 

</s><s>the point here is that, while you are dragging the rubberband up or down, you should be seeing the corresponding reading for the property at the different level of the rubberband.</s><s> do you see the 91 x 7.0 in the screenshot immediately above? 
i am going to stop here for now and not go into a comparison of rotation when set in applied effects tab route. 
</s><s>my recommendation for now, if you want to rotate the clip for orientation purposes (one that imports sideward - some cell phone users especially run into this) a. right click the clip and select rotate 90 left or rotate 90 right 
please let me know if this supplemental information help any.</s><s> and, what are the current matters that still need clarification. 
</s><s>thanks.</s><s>

</s><s>thanks for the follow ups. 
</s><s>as for motion rotation...do you want me to go into that any deeper. 
</s><s>the units are not as straight forward in rotating units, such as, 45, 90, 180 degrees, that you might run into once you start moving the rubberband up or down as well as moving the rotation slider in applied effects tab/applied effects palette/motion panel expanded.</s><s> and, there is a contrast that needs to be made between just rotating the whole clip versus keyframing the motion rotation property to vary the rotation across the whole clip.

i am not sure i am interpreting your question here.</s><s> but here is my take on what i think that you are asking about. 
</s><s>in premiere elements you can place comments about a scene at the timeline level using "unnumbered menu markers".</s><s> this type of maker is light blue and looks like a tab.</s><s> this type of marker does not show up in the end product whether you save the timeline as a file or burn the timeline to disc.</s><s> it is placed on the timeline where you have the timeline indicator position using markers tab/timeline marker/set timeline marker/unnumbered. 
</s><s>in contrast to this type of timeline marker, there are the menu markers which will be represented in the disc menu created.</s><s> scene marker, green circle with black dot in middle; main marker, blue circle with black dot in middle; stop marker, red circle with black line.</s><s> when you want a timeline scene to be represented on the main menu of your disc menu, then you use a main menu marker on the timeline.</s><s> when you want a timeline scene to be represented on the scene menu of your disc menu, then you use a scene menu marker on the timeline.

</s><s>in the editing area, the major marker for helping you edit is the unnumbered marker which can be used a. for comments b. in place of beat detection feature to have photos placed at the location of the unnumbered marker when you are using the create slideshow option in project assets right click of a group of media files.

<s>for the wab, it starts our automatically expanding to cover the entire area of the timeline, that has been used.</s><s> however, if the wab has been reset, that automatic expanding does not happen any longer. 
</s><s>the easiest way to expand it manually is to zoom out on the timeline view (that \, back slash key), and then dbl-clicking on the little "box" in the center of the wab area, the one that is in the middle of the wab area.</s><s> that will then expand the wab to enclose all of the used area.

</s><s>to download and install the premiere elements 12.1 update, you go to an open project and use help menu/update.</s><s> i wrote about that in the following.</s><s> i will include a link to what i wrote on this.</s><s> it has some screenshots included. http://www.atr935.blogspot.com/2014/03/pe12-update-121-released.html 
rendering the timeline is done to get the best possible preview of what you have displaying in the edit area playback in the monitor.</s><s> if the program decides that you have the best post preview, you will get no colored line over the timeline content or green line over the content.</s><s> if the program decides that it is not giving you the best possible preview, then you will get an orange line over the content involved.</s><s> and, when you press the enter key or the render button for those "orange line" situations, preview files will be generated.</s><s> each should contain the name of the project to which it is tied. 
</s><s>the point to get across is that we are talking about preview files.</s><s> rendering is not going to be a fix for problem in the project.</s><s> it is just going to give a preview for you to use to decide if you have a problem after you are given the best possible preview the program can give. 
</s><s>ok, let us say, you rendered the timeline and the content displays great in the edit area monitor.</s><s> the program created a preview file for it in the adobe premiere elements previews file folder.</s><s> you decide that you are in trouble with program performance because you have a pile up of this type of file.</s><s> depending on how desparate you are for space, you can delete the preview files (rendered files) for the project that you are in with the enter key or timeline/delete rendered files.</s><s> for saved/closed projects, to get rid of preview files (rendered files), you go to the adobe premiere elements previews file folder and delete preview files (rendered files) by project name. 
</s><s>you decide how much has to be deleted depending on how much free space you are trying to generate.</s><s> there can be gb amounts (huge) of those previews eating up your computer hard drive space. 
</s><s>but, when you get back to the project that generated what you deleted, you will find the render indicator indicating the file(s) need rendering to get the best possible preview.</s><s> the files on the timeline have lost the preview files to which they trace back. 
</s><s>after this deletion, in the saved/closed/opened project "do you need to render the content that you now find with orange line over it because you deleted preview files to save computer hard drive space?" if you do no further edits of the content, you could consider leaving the content as is.</s><s> prior previewing (before the preview file deletion) showed you it was ok.</s><s> that is up to you.</s><s> if you need to be assured of a best possible preview, then you render.</s><s> and consider, if you edit that specific content further, you will be forced to render to get the best possible preview of the here and now of the moment. 
</s><s>please review and let me know if you are ok with the above.</s><s> if not, i will approach all this from a different angle to get to the same end.

</s><s>deleting the preview files.</s><s> preview files are also called rendered files. 
a. if you have a project opened, you can delete all the rendered files for that specific project by clicking on timeline menu/delete rendered files.</s><s> when you do that, the actual files are deleted from libraries/documents/adobe/premiere elements/12.0/adobe premiere elements previews folder.</s><s> important.</s><s> when you have a hd project and you render the timeline content in it, if you use timeline/delete rendered files to delete the preview files from your opened project, that command will delete the mpeg2.mpeg preview file, but not its companion xmp file.</s><s> to get rid of the .xmp leftovers, then you have to go directly to libraries/documents/adobe/premiere elements/12.0/adobe premiere elements previews folder to do the clean up.</s><s> if you are doing a sd project and use timeline menu/delete rendered files, not to worry since here you get a dv avi preview file and no companion .xmp file that you have to clear away directly in that adobe premiere elements previews file folder. 
b. if you have saved/closed projects, then you need to go to libraries/documents/adobe/premiere elements/12.0/adobe premiere elements previews folder/ and delete the preview (rendered) files that you find there. 
</s><s>in all of this, the major thought is never delete the source files that went into a project that you still want after it was saved/closed.</s><s> that will get you into nuisance massive reconnecting media to project issues.</s><s> if these source media went into more than one project, especially do not delete the source media since it will still be need for the remaining wanted project to trace back to. 
</s><s>the autosaves are in libraries/documents/adobe/premiere elements/12.0/adobe premiere elements autosaves folder.</s><s> these are snapshots of the named project at different stages.</s><s> you should be able to right click anyone of them or all and select delete. http://help.adobe.com/en_us/premiereelements/using/wsa4213223-a072-483 f-9a0a-b8a95742c2ae.html i prefer to work with autosave turned off in a project and just hit save frequently.</s><s> we can discuss saving a project more later if necessary. 
</s><s>the prime concern right now are pile ups of those preview (rendered) files which can build up quickly into gb+ amounts. 
</s><s>please let me know if you are ok with the above and/or where you need supplemental clarification.

<s>ok...i will try and answer your 3 questions.</s><s> 1) i guess i don't even know where the 'main menu page' is.</s><s> i do see difference of course of the blue versus green makers, but still don't understand difference in their editing efficiency function.</s><s> 2) the second screen shot only showed that i typed a 'name' (as requested for the big box titled 'name'.</s><s>) so i typed in a unique name, not the words 'main menu maker'.</s><s> 3) as i remember there is a box called 'marker type' with a menu to choose either 'scene marker' or 'main menu marker'.</s><s> in the pertinent screen shot, i am only showing that i chose 'main menu marker' rather than 'scene marker'.</s><s> in the box mentioned in my first screen shot, i gave the clip a unique name.</s><s> i guess i don't know where the 'movie menu section' is of my movie.</s><s> i also don't understand much of what you are saying in a and b.</s><s> a lot of jargon here, e.g., ... thumbnails tracing back to scene menu markers...</s><s>?</s><s>?</s><s> i don't know what that means.</s><s> i thought i was asking a fairly simple question.</s><s> when you choose 'set menu marker' a big box appears asking you to 'name' the marker, big enough to allow a lot of words.</s><s> my question is what is the usefulness of this, if after naming the marker (which is then designated along the timeline), you can't 'find' the marker by the 'name' given to it.</s><s> the only choices when going to a marker are 'next' or 'previous'.</s><s> my intent with makers is of course to allow easy access to a point along my movie timeline, which i assume is why the program was built into the software.</s><s> as i have said before, using 'numbers' only either requires a good memory of each number assigned to each clip, or a written index as you assign numbers to each clip, if you want to immediately go a a point rather than clicking next..., next..., next..., next..., next..., or previous ....previous....till you find where you want to be.</s><s> i will just keep plugging along...i am just novice with all this anyway. thanks again for your prompt replies from yourself, mr. hunt and mr sg......

<s>pcnovicemesa 
</s><s>let us stick to dvd-video on dvd disc for this explanation and see if this helps. 
</s><s>when you do a burn to disc dvd, that disc can be played back with tv dvd player and/or computer player.</s><s> if you do not put menus into the project and create what is called a autoplay disc, the disc will start the movie immediately when the disc is inserted into the player.</s><s> the viewer does not have any control but to turn it on and off.</s><s> if you do include disc menu, the movie opens to the disc menu, then the viewer has control over what is being shown. 
</s><s>as for disc menu, that comes in a set...main menu and scene menu.</s><s> the main menu will display buttons for play all and scene selection.</s><s> if the viewer selects play all with the remote, that viewer gets play all.</s><s> if the viewer selects scene selection, the viewer switches from main menu being displayed to the scene menu "scene selection" page.</s><s> at that point, the viewer decides which scene to look at or can press a button the the scene selection page to get back to the main menu for play all. 
</s><s>now how does all that relate to those timeline markers (main menu marker, scene menu marker, and stop marker)?</s><s> let us focus on scene marker.</s><s> you want the viewer to go able to go to specific scenes in the scene selection page rather than play all from the main menu.</s><s> so, you place scene markers on the timeline where you want the viewer to be able to go in the scene selection of the dvd produced.</s><s> you place the scene marker at the timeline level - first scene marker, second scene marker, third scene marker, and so on in order going from left to right in the timeline content. 
</s><s>now you need a menu that will takes it direction from where you have placed those markers and translate that into buttons action that the viewer will use to see what you want the viewer to be able to choose and see at end product playback.</s><s> keep the thought - scene markers go on a scene menu page and any main menu markers go on a main menu page. 
</s><s>but, you need a menu in conjunction with those scene markers.</s><s> that is when you go to tools menu/movie menu and make your selection of menu theme.</s><s> after you make your menu theme selection (comes with main menu and scene menu) and click continue in this theme display area, you will then enter the movie menu customization area.</s><s> the scene markers that you set at the timeline level will now trace to the scene buttons in the scene menu page of the menu and will be put into those scene buttons in the order that you placed them when you were in the timeline. 
</s><s>important: once you finish with the menu customization, you can preview what you have to assure that the navigation buttons (main menu - play all and scene selection buttons and scene menu - scene buttons) are working.</s><s> click done when finished.</s><s> that is the last that you will see of the disc menus until after you or the viewer views the dvd on the tv dvd player or computer player. 
</s><s>there are other considerations and details associated with it, but we need to make sure that we are in sync with the above before moving further and deeper into this. 
</s><s>miscellaneous 
</s><s>1. although the marker dialog for each marker gives you a large space to enter a scene name, you are limited to the number of words you can put in there to describe the scene.</s><s> sure, you can fit a lot in the marker dialog, but, when you go to see what that looks like in the disc menu customization area and preview, you are going to be in a space problem.</s><s> keep the button names short. 
2.</s><s> you are not confined to next and previous to explore a button already named.</s><s> you can double click an individual scene marker to bring up its marker dialog. 
</s><s>please let me know if you are ok with the above and not ok.</s><s> if not ok, please let me know where we need more work.

<s>1) i sent a comment 2/24 about searching thru my video using comments i had added to either the timeline marker or menu marker (can't remember which one).</s><s> that is, i thought i had found a menu where i could find all the markers i had made with the comments i had added, then cursor thru the each one till i found the clip i wanted, then click on the one i wanted to immediately take me to the spot on the timeline.</s><s> i didn't see a reply to that question specifically so am wondering if that exists or not.</s><s> searching for a specific clip using comments added would be easier than 'numbers' or 'previous/ next', unless i make a list of the clip numbers with names and numbers assigned to each.</s><s> it is just annoying to move the cti head thru all my video looking for the exact spot when i can't remember the number i gave a clip.

i am not sure i am interpreting your question here.</s><s> but here is my take on what i think that you are asking about. 
</s><s>in premiere elements you can place comments about a scene at the timeline level using "unnumbered menu markers".</s><s> this type of maker is light blue and looks like a tab.</s><s> this type of marker does not show up in the end product whether you save the timeline as a file or burn the timeline to disc.</s><s> it is placed on the timeline where you have the timeline indicator position using markers tab/timeline marker/set timeline marker/unnumbered. 
</s><s>in contrast to this type of timeline marker, there are the menu markers which will be represented in the disc menu created.</s><s> scene marker, green circle with black dot in middle; main marker, blue circle with black dot in middle; stop marker, red circle with black line.</s><s> when you want a timeline scene to be represented on the main menu of your disc menu, then you use a main menu marker on the timeline.</s><s> when you want a timeline scene to be represented on the scene menu of your disc menu, then you use a scene menu marker on the timeline.

<s>2) also, i can't find the difference between a timeline marker and a menu marker in 'function' along the timeline.</s><s> what is the difference in their 'function' and how each helps me?</s><s> i see their distinct icon, but don't know the difference in function to editing. 
</s></quote>
</s><s>in the editing area, the major marker for helping you edit is the unnumbered marker which can be used a. for comments b. in place of beat detection feature to have photos placed at the location of the unnumbered marker when you are using the create slideshow option in project assets right click of a group of media files. 
</s><s>the disc menus are for just that.</s><s> their timeline locations are linked to the disc menu locations where you want a scene or movie to be - main menu or scene menu. 
<quote>
<s>3) i am trying to narrow the work bar area as suggested by mr grisetti, but can't figure out how to restore to the previousre work bar area when i am finished rendering or editing.</s><s> he said to 'click on the back slash' in the video, but doing this collapses the timeline to its minimal size.</s><s> then i have to expand to continue editing.</s><s> so i can adjust the work area using the techniques in mr grisetti's video, but cant' figure out how to exit it w/o collapasing the entire video to a size that is not useful for editing. 
</s></quote>if you want to change the location of the gray tabs of the work area bar after you have moved them to a new location to do selective rendering of the timeline or selective exporting, please look at the following a. move the timeline indicator to the start of the timeline content, hold down the alt key of the computer main keyboard and press the left bracket key [ of the computer main keyboard.</s><s> b. move the timeline indicator to the edn of the timeline content, hodl down the alt key of the computer main keyboard and press the right brack key ] of the computer main keyboard.

</s><s>by example, if i have two photos directly above one another, one on video 1 and one on video 2, all i am going to see in the monitor is the photo on video 2.</s><s> but, if i lower its opacity i can see part of or all of the photo on video 1 depend how low i take the opacity on a scale of 100 to 0%.</s><s> sometimes you might want to create an image with a subtle background of the other in it...or other.

</s><s>to download and install the premiere elements 12.1 update, you go to an open project and use help menu/update.</s><s> i wrote about that in the following.</s><s> i will include a link to what i wrote on this.</s><s> it has some screenshots included. http://www.atr935.blogspot.com/2014/03/pe12-update-121-released.html 
rendering the timeline is done to get the best possible preview of what you have displaying in the edit area playback in the monitor.</s><s> if the program decides that you have the best post preview, you will get no colored line over the timeline content or green line over the content.</s><s> if the program decides that it is not giving you the best possible preview, then you will get an orange line over the content involved.</s><s> and, when you press the enter key or the render button for those "orange line" situations, preview files will be generated.</s><s> each should contain the name of the project to which it is tied. 
</s><s>the point to get across is that we are talking about preview files.</s><s> rendering is not going to be a fix for problem in the project.</s><s> it is just going to give a preview for you to use to decide if you have a problem after you are given the best possible preview the program can give. 
</s><s>ok, let us say, you rendered the timeline and the content displays great in the edit area monitor.</s><s> the program created a preview file for it in the adobe premiere elements previews file folder.</s><s> you decide that you are in trouble with program performance because you have a pile up of this type of file.</s><s> depending on how desparate you are for space, you can delete the preview files (rendered files) for the project that you are in with the enter key or timeline/delete rendered files.</s><s> for saved/closed projects, to get rid of preview files (rendered files), you go to the adobe premiere elements previews file folder and delete preview files (rendered files) by project name. 
</s><s>you decide how much has to be deleted depending on how much free space you are trying to generate.</s><s> there can be gb amounts (huge) of those previews eating up your computer hard drive space. 
</s><s>but, when you get back to the project that generated what you deleted, you will find the render indicator indicating the file(s) need rendering to get the best possible preview.</s><s> the files on the timeline have lost the preview files to which they trace back. 
</s><s>after this deletion, in the saved/closed/opened project "do you need to render the content that you now find with orange line over it because you deleted preview files to save computer hard drive space?" if you do no further edits of the content, you could consider leaving the content as is.</s><s> prior previewing (before the preview file deletion) showed you it was ok.</s><s> that is up to you.</s><s> if you need to be assured of a best possible preview, then you render.</s><s> and consider, if you edit that specific content further, you will be forced to render to get the best possible preview of the here and now of the moment. 
</s><s>please review and let me know if you are ok with the above.</s><s> if not, i will approach all this from a different angle to get to the same end.

b. if you have saved/closed projects, then you need to go to libraries/documents/adobe/premiere elements/12.0/adobe premiere elements previews folder/ and delete the preview (rendered) files that you find there. 
</s><s>in all of this, the major thought is never delete the source files that went into a project that you still want after it was saved/closed.</s><s> that will get you into nuisance massive reconnecting media to project issues.</s><s> if these source media went into more than one project, especially do not delete the source media since it will still be need for the remaining wanted project to trace back to. 
</s><s>the autosaves are in libraries/documents/adobe/premiere elements/12.0/adobe premiere elements autosaves folder.</s><s> these are snapshots of the named project at different stages.</s><s> you should be able to right click anyone of them or all and select delete. http://help.adobe.com/en_us/premiereelements/using/wsa4213223-a072-483 f-9a0a-b8a95742c2ae.html i prefer to work with autosave turned off in a project and just hit save frequently.</s><s> we can discuss saving a project more later if necessary. 
</s><s>the prime concern right now are pile ups of those preview (rendered) files which can build up quickly into gb+ amounts.

</s><s>your screeenshots did not get posted so i will work from your description of each. 
1.</s><s> timeline clip to which you wanted to apply a menu marker (the menu marker will be represented on the main menu page if you use a main menu marker (blue) or on the scene menu page if you use a scene marker (green).</s><s> so far you have not said which. 
2.</s><s> does this show what you show and did in the marker dialog that is associated with a specific marker at the cti? 
3.</s><s> in your 3rd screenshot, did you actually designated "main menu marker" in the marker type field or did you just name the marker that you were placing "main menu marker".</s><s> i asked since you said your "called it a menu menu marker" rather than you set a main menu marker. 
</s><s>there is no feature to summarize your total menu marker placement at the timeline level. 
</s><s>when you create your movie menu in the movie menu section of the opened project, you can see the results of your timeline menu marker placements. 
a. thumbnails tracing back to scene menu markers placed on the timeline will appear in the scene selection page in the order that you placed them on the timeline.</s><s> thumbnails tracing back to main menu markers placed on the timeline will appear in the main menu page in the order that you placed them on the timeline.</s><s> but, remember that once the number of scenes exceeds the number of buttons per menu page, there will be spill over, and the program will generate copies of the lst page to accomodate the rest based on the number of main menu or scene menu buttons designed into the adobe disc menu. 
b. you can see the effect of your work in the movie menu preview section.</s><s> also, in the movie menu section, you will see a bin underneath of movie menu screen.</s><s> it has all the pages generated, main and scene.</s><s> when you want to see a page on in the screen, then click on the bin page that you want to bring up in the screen above.</s><s> you should be able to double click your main and scene buttons in movie menu screen by double clicking them. 
i am concerned about the scheme of your movie menu and your use of main menu marker.</s><s> please let me know what your intended plan is for the overall menus.</s><s> if you do not know, then just tell me what you want to create menu wise for your viewer's navigation of the disc end product.

<s>ok...i will try and answer your 3 questions.</s><s> 1) i guess i don't even know where the 'main menu page' is.</s><s> i do see difference of course of the blue versus green makers, but still don't understand difference in their editing efficiency function.</s><s> 2) the second screen shot only showed that i typed a 'name' (as requested for the big box titled 'name'.</s><s>) so i typed in a unique name, not the words 'main menu maker'.</s><s> 3) as i remember there is a box called 'marker type' with a menu to choose either 'scene marker' or 'main menu marker'.</s><s> in the pertinent screen shot, i am only showing that i chose 'main menu marker' rather than 'scene marker'.</s><s> in the box mentioned in my first screen shot, i gave the clip a unique name.</s><s> i guess i don't know where the 'movie menu section' is of my movie.</s><s> i also don't understand much of what you are saying in a and b.</s><s> a lot of jargon here, e.g., ... thumbnails tracing back to scene menu markers...</s><s>?</s><s>?</s><s> i don't know what that means.</s><s> i thought i was asking a fairly simple question.</s><s> when you choose 'set menu marker' a big box appears asking you to 'name' the marker, big enough to allow a lot of words.</s><s> my question is what is the usefulness of this, if after naming the marker (which is then designated along the timeline), you can't 'find' the marker by the 'name' given to it.</s><s> the only choices when going to a marker are 'next' or 'previous'.</s><s> my intent with makers is of course to allow easy access to a point along my movie timeline, which i assume is why the program was built into the software.</s><s> as i have said before, using 'numbers' only either requires a good memory of each number assigned to each clip, or a written index as you assign numbers to each clip, if you want to immediately go a a point rather than clicking next..., next..., next..., next..., next..., or previous ....previous....till you find where you want to be.</s><s> i will just keep plugging along...i am just novice with all this anyway. thanks again for your prompt replies from yourself, mr. hunt and mr sg......

<s>pcnovicemesa 
</s><s>let us stick to dvd-video on dvd disc for this explanation and see if this helps. 
</s><s>when you do a burn to disc dvd, that disc can be played back with tv dvd player and/or computer player.</s><s> if you do not put menus into the project and create what is called a autoplay disc, the disc will start the movie immediately when the disc is inserted into the player.</s><s> the viewer does not have any control but to turn it on and off.</s><s> if you do include disc menu, the movie opens to the disc menu, then the viewer has control over what is being shown. 
</s><s>as for disc menu, that comes in a set...main menu and scene menu.</s><s> the main menu will display buttons for play all and scene selection.</s><s> if the viewer selects play all with the remote, that viewer gets play all.</s><s> if the viewer selects scene selection, the viewer switches from main menu being displayed to the scene menu "scene selection" page.</s><s> at that point, the viewer decides which scene to look at or can press a button the the scene selection page to get back to the main menu for play all. 
</s><s>now how does all that relate to those timeline markers (main menu marker, scene menu marker, and stop marker)?</s><s> let us focus on scene marker.</s><s> you want the viewer to go able to go to specific scenes in the scene selection page rather than play all from the main menu.</s><s> so, you place scene markers on the timeline where you want the viewer to be able to go in the scene selection of the dvd produced.</s><s> you place the scene marker at the timeline level - first scene marker, second scene marker, third scene marker, and so on in order going from left to right in the timeline content. 
</s><s>now you need a menu that will takes it direction from where you have placed those markers and translate that into buttons action that the viewer will use to see what you want the viewer to be able to choose and see at end product playback.</s><s> keep the thought - scene markers go on a scene menu page and any main menu markers go on a main menu page. 
</s><s>but, you need a menu in conjunction with those scene markers.</s><s> that is when you go to tools menu/movie menu and make your selection of menu theme.</s><s> after you make your menu theme selection (comes with main menu and scene menu) and click continue in this theme display area, you will then enter the movie menu customization area.</s><s> the scene markers that you set at the timeline level will now trace to the scene buttons in the scene menu page of the menu and will be put into those scene buttons in the order that you placed them when you were in the timeline. 
</s><s>important: once you finish with the menu customization, you can preview what you have to assure that the navigation buttons (main menu - play all and scene selection buttons and scene menu - scene buttons) are working.</s><s> click done when finished.</s><s> that is the last that you will see of the disc menus until after you or the viewer views the dvd on the tv dvd player or computer player. 
</s><s>there are other considerations and details associated with it, but we need to make sure that we are in sync with the above before moving further and deeper into this. 
</s><s>miscellaneous 
</s><s>1. although the marker dialog for each marker gives you a large space to enter a scene name, you are limited to the number of words you can put in there to describe the scene.</s><s> sure, you can fit a lot in the marker dialog, but, when you go to see what that looks like in the disc menu customization area and preview, you are going to be in a space problem.</s><s> keep the button names short. 
2.</s><s> you are not confined to next and previous to explore a button already named.</s><s> you can double click an individual scene marker to bring up its marker dialog. 
</s><s>please let me know if you are ok with the above and not ok.</s><s> if not ok, please let me know where we need more work. 
</s><s>thanks.</s><s>

<s>ok.</s><s> yes.</s><s> your explanation now begins to make overall sense.</s><s> i had completely forgot about the viewer of the video and having the ability to navigate rather than just 'play all'.your discussion now of markers makes more sense.</s><s> so markers can help during editing but they are more designed to help the viewer of the final disc.</s><s> this should be included in some introductory session or tutorial for those beginners like me that don't think of final output of the product.</s><s> your #1 and #2 also make sense so will try more practice.</s><s> thanks again...</s><s>!</s><s>

this is an older thread going back to may 2013 so i am not sure how soon susan verner will see your question on what she said was her workaround for this text matter. 
</s><s>but, when she says "...</s><s>(this is also a workaround for text animation on multi-line titles....", then she must be talking about what i described in my blog post under the header of "applying text animation to 2 or more lines of text per title (in this example 3 lines)" with this technique and the example that i wrote about, there were 3 lines of text all within the same title file, not 3 lines of text each with its own title file. http://www.atr935.blogspot.com/2013/07/pe-titler-part-1-text-animation s.html

<s>i don't think anyone here will be able to help... program activation is only from the adobe server, and it seems, from what you say, that feature is no longer supported 
you may of course export your finished video to dv avi and then import that into some other dvd authoring software 
i do not use these, but they should work http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/dvdastudio -or http://www.deskshare.com/dvd-authoring-burning-software.aspx
