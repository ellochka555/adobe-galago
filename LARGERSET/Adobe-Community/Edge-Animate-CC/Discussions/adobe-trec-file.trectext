<s>there is a lot of different ways of doing that i would suggest displaying your page with an iframe within another page so you dont have to overload edge default styles , or add css to your stage : $("#stage").css("margin","auto") should do the trick , in an action at the start of your composition.

<s>joel has been pretty thorough here... but should you still have problems with your build then feel free to let me know. 
i tested your live html and modified it to center the comp on screen, so if all you want is to center the composition you have to simply change the "width: 1350px;" to "width: 1000px;" in the style tag so that it will read: 
<style type="text/css"><!--#stage {top: 10px; height: 700px; width: 1000px; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;}--></style> 
</s><s>then like i said earlier you need to add a "wrapping" div around all the html contained withing the <body>...</body> tags.</s><s> you need to set that div to be the one with its id set to the value of "stage" like in: 
<body...</s><s>> <audio id="myaudio"...</s><s>> <audio id="fx"...</s><s>> 
</s><s><div id="stage"> 
...all your exising html code remains intact here ... 
</div> 
</body> 
</s><s>the parts in bold green is what you should modify as instructed while the part in bold red are new lines of code you would need to add to your page. 
i don't know how you are working within edge so i can't tell you how you should be modifying the project, but from the code that's been output i was able to make those simple modification/addition et voilˆ, all got centered 
i hope things will be a bit clearer now but if now don't be shy and keep ask ;d

<s>you can try with something like: 
sym.$('#stage').css({'margin-left':'25%', 'margin-right':'25%', 'width':'550', 'position':'absolute', 'bottom':'0px' 'text-align':'center'}); 
that should place your div id="stage" at the bottom and assuming your stage width is 550 px then it will maintain a that div at the bottom and centered. 
</s><s>if you want to all sizing proportionally you could use width:50% but that will crop the content visually and if your content required overflow-x to remain hidden it won't work, but you don't need to hide the overflow-x then you could use a combination like setting the margin left and right to 15% and the content to 70% to add up to 100% of the width and have the content remain always in the center bottom area (though when browser window get resized to anything that won't fit what you need to display at the bottom, that content will be "cropped". 
</s><s>other than doing it this quick way, you would need a combination of containters and wrappers... better tried than explained ;p i hope the info above will help you and should something be unclear ask away. 
</s><s>cheers!</s><s> tfbkny 
ps: i find it rather idiotic that w3c continues to ignore something so simple that was already available in the past.</s><s> it should be as easy as implementing instructions such as align:center; and anchor:bottom; which ridiculously enough don't exist yet even after several iterations of css.</s><s> we still need to do acrobatic bs backflips and know some secret masonic handshakes to accomplish something so extremely simple.</s><s> why in the past we could simply write the attribute align="center" and css left that behind relegating it to the unreliable margin:auto it's rather surprising to put it mildly.

<s>there is a lot of different ways of doing that i would suggest displaying your page with an iframe within another page so you dont have to overload edge default styles , or add css to your stage : $("#stage").css("margin","auto") should do the trick , in an action at the start of your composition.

<s>joel has been pretty thorough here... but should you still have problems with your build then feel free to let me know. 
i tested your live html and modified it to center the comp on screen, so if all you want is to center the composition you have to simply change the "width: 1350px;" to "width: 1000px;" in the style tag so that it will read: 
<style type="text/css"><!--#stage {top: 10px; height: 700px; width: 1000px; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;}--></style> 
</s><s>then like i said earlier you need to add a "wrapping" div around all the html contained withing the <body>...</body> tags.</s><s> you need to set that div to be the one with its id set to the value of "stage" like in: 
<body...</s><s>> <audio id="myaudio"...</s><s>> <audio id="fx"...</s><s>> 
</s><s><div id="stage"> 
...all your exising html code remains intact here ... 
</div> 
</body> 
</s><s>the parts in bold green is what you should modify as instructed while the part in bold red are new lines of code you would need to add to your page. 
i don't know how you are working within edge so i can't tell you how you should be modifying the project, but from the code that's been output i was able to make those simple modification/addition et voilˆ, all got centered 
i hope things will be a bit clearer now but if now don't be shy and keep ask ;d

<s>you can try with something like: 
sym.$('#stage').css({'margin-left':'25%', 'margin-right':'25%', 'width':'550', 'position':'absolute', 'bottom':'0px' 'text-align':'center'}); 
that should place your div id="stage" at the bottom and assuming your stage width is 550 px then it will maintain a that div at the bottom and centered. 
</s><s>if you want to all sizing proportionally you could use width:50% but that will crop the content visually and if your content required overflow-x to remain hidden it won't work, but you don't need to hide the overflow-x then you could use a combination like setting the margin left and right to 15% and the content to 70% to add up to 100% of the width and have the content remain always in the center bottom area (though when browser window get resized to anything that won't fit what you need to display at the bottom, that content will be "cropped". 
</s><s>other than doing it this quick way, you would need a combination of containters and wrappers... better tried than explained ;p i hope the info above will help you and should something be unclear ask away. 
</s><s>cheers!</s><s> tfbkny 
ps: i find it rather idiotic that w3c continues to ignore something so simple that was already available in the past.</s><s> it should be as easy as implementing instructions such as align:center; and anchor:bottom; which ridiculously enough don't exist yet even after several iterations of css.</s><s> we still need to do acrobatic bs backflips and know some secret masonic handshakes to accomplish something so extremely simple.</s><s> why in the past we could simply write the attribute align="center" and css left that behind relegating it to the unreliable margin:auto it's rather surprising to put it mildly.

<s>you would do that in the code window. 
</s><s>select window>code (or command-e on mac control-e on pc) once the code window opens you can select "stage" in column to the left of the code window, then add the css as mentioned above in the text area on the right.</s><s> that's where you would insert your code. 
</s><s>about the resizing i don't think i get what you mean...</s><s> a square will remain a square when you resize the window.</s><s> if you want a fixed size square, just draw a square and use the position and size in the properties panel to the left.</s><s> if you want that to scale simply use percentage values instead of pixels.</s><s> if you want to place an image inside the square, turn that into a simbol then edit the symbol (double-clicking on it or right-clicking and choosing edit "symbol name"), import an image to place it into the square symbol and you'll have your square image.</s><s> i don't think you are talking about scaling the image itself since scaling gif images would truly be quite a nonsense ;p

<s>hey andrew, Ê you'll probably be able to do all those things with the code below. Ê Ê access the a symbol timeline within another symbol to access another symbol element from within a symbol, use the following in your event: sym.getcomposition().getstage().getsymbol("symbolname").play(); // gets the stage from the composition level, then gets the symbol and plays the timeline Ê to access a nested symbol timeline from within a symbol, use the following: Ê sym.getcomposition().getstage().getsymbol("symbolname1").getsymbol("sy mbolname2").play(0); // gets the stage from the composition level, gets the parent symbol, then gets the nested symbol timeline Ê you can access elements from within a symbol timeline from within another symbol.</s><s> for example: sym.getcomposition().getstage().getsymbol("kitten_1").$("kitten_paw"). hide(); // gets the symbol element "kitten_1" and hides the element "kitten_paw" Ê access a nested symbol timeline from another symbol to access the timeline of a nested symbol, use the following in your event: Ê sym.getcomposition().getstage().sym.getsymbol("symbolname").getsymbol( "nestedelementname").play(); Ê you can also access elements within a nested symbol from the stage.</s><s> for example: sym.getcomposition().getstage().sym.getsymbol("kitten_1").getsymbol("k itten_paw").$("paw").hide(); // hides the element "paw" from within a nested symbol Ê hope that helps!</s><s> sarah

<s>love new features for which most of us shower you with kudos from all sides... that said you know we are a bunch of demanding scoundrels! ;d 
</s><s>so, in the interest of moving past the congratulatory phase for a milestone worthy of a good pat on the shoulder for a job well done... 
- i wish there was a more visual way to target all existing symbols and elements without having to do all the singing and dancing each time... could be (or not) similart to the targeting in flash although i'd prefer a dropdown listing all the "targetable" elements and symbols (absolute and relative).</s><s> that would be a really a huge help to avoid the trial and error process that is needed each time to get the target to respond to the properties being added or code being attached. 
- i also wish that edge had a way to autocomplete instructions with multiple selectable suggestions (like in intellij idea et sim ides) where code from the linked apis (edge, jquery, custom added ones) would be selectable as the code is being typed by triggering the autocomplete using a modifier key 
- also snippets that could be reused over and over could prove very helpful... is there a way (other than keeping a manual archive in a commented-out code on an unused symbol) tha could serve that purpose? 
</s><s>lastly i've found scoping issues and i don't know if that has anything to do with targeting... but for instance, i could not define and use variables in a symbol unless i had declared on the stage on creationcomplete.</s><s> just to give you an example: i could not do a simple var myvar=0; myvar++; alert (myvar); "inside" a symbol used as a button responding to a click event.</s><s> using the letter "i" withing that click event (since "i" it's likely already declared somewhere in the javascript api, would be perfectly fine as long as not "re-declaring it" using "var".</s><s> the variable myvar could be used without issues once declaring it on stage upon creationcomplete as var myvar = 0;

<s>hey andrew, Ê you'll probably be able to do all those things with the code below. Ê Ê access the a symbol timeline within another symbol to access another symbol element from within a symbol, use the following in your event: sym.getcomposition().getstage().getsymbol("symbolname").play(); // gets the stage from the composition level, then gets the symbol and plays the timeline Ê to access a nested symbol timeline from within a symbol, use the following: Ê sym.getcomposition().getstage().getsymbol("symbolname1").getsymbol("sy mbolname2").play(0); // gets the stage from the composition level, gets the parent symbol, then gets the nested symbol timeline Ê you can access elements from within a symbol timeline from within another symbol.</s><s> for example: sym.getcomposition().getstage().getsymbol("kitten_1").$("kitten_paw"). hide(); // gets the symbol element "kitten_1" and hides the element "kitten_paw" Ê access a nested symbol timeline from another symbol to access the timeline of a nested symbol, use the following in your event: Ê sym.getcomposition().getstage().sym.getsymbol("symbolname").getsymbol( "nestedelementname").play(); Ê you can also access elements within a nested symbol from the stage.</s><s> for example: sym.getcomposition().getstage().sym.getsymbol("kitten_1").getsymbol("k itten_paw").$("paw").hide(); // hides the element "paw" from within a nested symbol Ê hope that helps!</s><s> sarah

<s>love new features for which most of us shower you with kudos from all sides... that said you know we are a bunch of demanding scoundrels! ;d 
</s><s>so, in the interest of moving past the congratulatory phase for a milestone worthy of a good pat on the shoulder for a job well done... 
- i wish there was a more visual way to target all existing symbols and elements without having to do all the singing and dancing each time... could be (or not) similart to the targeting in flash although i'd prefer a dropdown listing all the "targetable" elements and symbols (absolute and relative).</s><s> that would be a really a huge help to avoid the trial and error process that is needed each time to get the target to respond to the properties being added or code being attached. 
- i also wish that edge had a way to autocomplete instructions with multiple selectable suggestions (like in intellij idea et sim ides) where code from the linked apis (edge, jquery, custom added ones) would be selectable as the code is being typed by triggering the autocomplete using a modifier key 
- also snippets that could be reused over and over could prove very helpful... is there a way (other than keeping a manual archive in a commented-out code on an unused symbol) tha could serve that purpose? 
</s><s>lastly i've found scoping issues and i don't know if that has anything to do with targeting... but for instance, i could not define and use variables in a symbol unless i had declared on the stage on creationcomplete.</s><s> just to give you an example: i could not do a simple var myvar=0; myvar++; alert (myvar); "inside" a symbol used as a button responding to a click event.</s><s> using the letter "i" withing that click event (since "i" it's likely already declared somewhere in the javascript api, would be perfectly fine as long as not "re-declaring it" using "var".</s><s> the variable myvar could be used without issues once declaring it on stage upon creationcomplete as var myvar = 0; 
...and as usual thanks for keeping up the awesome work!

<s>hi all, 
</s><s>my question is very straight forward: 
i would like to fire up a function as soon as a symbol has finished playing, and i would like to write the code in the stage event. 
</s><s>ive created a very simple exmple for the matter: 
i have two symbols each with a very simple animation taking them out of the screen, and each with a trigger on 0ms - sym.stop(); i start rect1 animation in the stage event and i would like to call a callback function as soon as rect1's playback is complete. 
screensohts attached: 


i think a lot of people would like to see a sulotion to this issue. 
thank you!</s><s> asafg84

</s><s>second : merge your chapters (projects) i think the mess part of your project is this part that user should go to a seperate page to see the next chapter, you can make all chapers happen in one project and then user can change chapters inside the project and i think this way is more better, cause users will not get loading for every chapter then

</s><s>second : merge your chapters (projects) i think the mess part of your project is this part that user should go to a seperate page to see the next chapter, you can make all chapers happen in one project and then user can change chapters inside the project and i think this way is more better, cause users will not get loading for every chapter then

<s>hello, i have just experienced a new problem that my edge banner does not work in ie 8.</s><s> so...., to cut a long story short, edge gives you an option to make a copy snap shot form any of your edge animated pics for browsers like ie8 or down level browsers.</s><s> basically it's just a static photo enabling these browser viewers to see at least your main titled banner. 
</s><s>since i am using cs6 fluid grid layouts and have already put together a header, navbar,languagebar, content and footer, and uploaded to server, they all work fine in browsers like safari, firfox, g.chrome, but when i try browsing using my old ie 8 the png image snap-shot of my edge banner shows , but my navbar has moved to the top and is covering the top part of the banner and my language banner seems to behind that as i cannot see it anymore when looking at ie8....</s><s>?</s><s> 
</s><s>can anyone help me please with this issue in ie8....</s><s>?</s><s>?</s><s> do i need to implement further settings in the cs6 fluid grid divs to keep them in place for this type of issue...</s><s>?</s><s>

<s>very strange.</s><s> the problem only seems to me occuring when i save to a particular location (a sub folder of a long existing folder...not the same folder where the images are imported from).</s><s> when i save it to this particular location the images disappear from edge animate (though their bounding boxes are still there).</s><s> i created new folder from the desktop and saved the animate there and everything was fine...images didn't disappear.

<s>there is a lot of different ways of doing that i would suggest displaying your page with an iframe within another page so you dont have to overload edge default styles , or add css to your stage : $("#stage").css("margin","auto") should do the trick , in an action at the start of your composition.

<s>joel has been pretty thorough here... but should you still have problems with your build then feel free to let me know. 
i tested your live html and modified it to center the comp on screen, so if all you want is to center the composition you have to simply change the "width: 1350px;" to "width: 1000px;" in the style tag so that it will read: 
<style type="text/css"><!--#stage {top: 10px; height: 700px; width: 1000px; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;}--></style> 
</s><s>then like i said earlier you need to add a "wrapping" div around all the html contained withing the <body>...</body> tags.</s><s> you need to set that div to be the one with its id set to the value of "stage" like in: 
<body...</s><s>> <audio id="myaudio"...</s><s>> <audio id="fx"...</s><s>> 
</s><s><div id="stage"> 
...all your exising html code remains intact here ... 
</div> 
</body> 
</s><s>the parts in bold green is what you should modify as instructed while the part in bold red are new lines of code you would need to add to your page. 
i don't know how you are working within edge so i can't tell you how you should be modifying the project, but from the code that's been output i was able to make those simple modification/addition et voilˆ, all got centered 
i hope things will be a bit clearer now but if now don't be shy and keep ask ;d

<s>you can try with something like: 
sym.$('#stage').css({'margin-left':'25%', 'margin-right':'25%', 'width':'550', 'position':'absolute', 'bottom':'0px' 'text-align':'center'}); 
that should place your div id="stage" at the bottom and assuming your stage width is 550 px then it will maintain a that div at the bottom and centered. 
</s><s>if you want to all sizing proportionally you could use width:50% but that will crop the content visually and if your content required overflow-x to remain hidden it won't work, but you don't need to hide the overflow-x then you could use a combination like setting the margin left and right to 15% and the content to 70% to add up to 100% of the width and have the content remain always in the center bottom area (though when browser window get resized to anything that won't fit what you need to display at the bottom, that content will be "cropped". 
</s><s>other than doing it this quick way, you would need a combination of containters and wrappers... better tried than explained ;p i hope the info above will help you and should something be unclear ask away. 
</s><s>cheers!</s><s> tfbkny 
ps: i find it rather idiotic that w3c continues to ignore something so simple that was already available in the past.</s><s> it should be as easy as implementing instructions such as align:center; and anchor:bottom; which ridiculously enough don't exist yet even after several iterations of css.</s><s> we still need to do acrobatic bs backflips and know some secret masonic handshakes to accomplish something so extremely simple.</s><s> why in the past we could simply write the attribute align="center" and css left that behind relegating it to the unreliable margin:auto it's rather surprising to put it mildly.

$("#stage").css("margin","auto") sym.$("#stage").css("background-image","url(images/background.jpg)","b ackground-repeat","repeat") 
background will work only if i change "w" and "h" to "%" but centering the stage will get off and it goes back to the left

</s></quote>place the below in stage > compositionready event handler.</s><s> remove the space in the css syntax - in your eample you have a space between the b a; be sure to close each statement with a semi-colon ; 
$("#stage").css("margin","auto"); sym.$("#stage").css("background-image","url(images/background.jpg)","background-repeat","repeat");

<s>hi adam- the short answer is no. 
</s><s>if you want to control playback of an animation in edge animate, rather than using a gif animation, you should create a symbol with a nested png sequence, or a symbol with a nested spritesheet.</s><s> in the current edge build 1.0, you will have to manually create the keyframes for the playback with these two methods (unless you use john dunning's nifty fireworks plugin.</s><s> look under "exporting animations as edge symbols": http://johndunning.com/fireworks/about/edgeanimate.</s><s>)

<s>hey adam, if you need to control the animation's timeline, i would reccommend this workflow to get an animation from ae to edge: 
1) export png sequence from after effects 2) install the mxp for john dunning's fw->edge export plugin (http://johndunning.com/fireworks/about/edgeanimate) 3) create a multi-state document in fw with each of your pngs in a different state 4) export the animation from fw as an edge symbol (should you export as spritesheet or png sequence?</s><s> spritesheets requires less hits on the server, but if the spritesheet is too big, it won't show up on low memory devices like ipad1, iphone4.</s><s> png sequences cost a lot of hits on the server, but if your animation is small, probably won't exceed the device's memory) 5) import the new symbol into edge (how to: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o7wgftmt58) 
</s><s>if you don't have a recent version of fw, you can manually set keyframes for the png sequence (new image each keyframe) or spritesheet (new position each keyframe).</s><s> in this case, i'd probably run a javascript settimeout timer, to change the values through code, rather than laboriously setting each keyframe on the timeline. 
</s><s>here are the instructions from john dunning's post for the fw/edge workflow: 
exporting animations as edge symbols 
in addition to exporting a fireworks document as an edge project, you can export a multi-state document as an edge animation symbol.</s><s> the animations can be exported as either a series of pngs or a single sprite image.</s><s> when you run the edge animate > export as edge png animation command, you'll be asked to select a directory where the animation will be saved.</s><s> each state in the fireworks document will then be exported as a 32-bit png, as long as its include when exporting option is checked.</s><s> the pngs are added to a timeline, separated from the previous frame by the delay time set in the fireworks states panel.</s><s> (to change the delay, double-click the number to the right of the state name and enter a delay in 1/100ths of a second.</s><s>) the pngs and the timeline code are then bundled together into an .ansym file, which is what edge animate uses to store symbols externally.</s><s> the edge animate > export as edge sprite animation command works similarly, but the animation frames are stacked horizontally in a single wide image.</s><s> the image is clipped to show a single frame's width of the sprite, and itsbackground-position property is animated to show one frame at a time.</s><s> the advantage of the sprite export is that the animation makes just one http request when pre-loading the image, vs. one for each frame in the png export.</s><s> but the very wide images that are created might pose problems in some browsers.</s><s> once the animation is exported, you can click the + button in the symbols section of edge animate's library panel and select import symbols....</s><s> in the resulting dialog, select the .ansym file that you exported from fireworks.</s><s> the looping setting in the states panel controls how the exported animation behaves.</s><s> the default is forever, but you can change it to one of the other options in the menu.

<s>hi adam- the short answer is no. 
</s><s>if you want to control playback of an animation in edge animate, rather than using a gif animation, you should create a symbol with a nested png sequence, or a symbol with a nested spritesheet.</s><s> in the current edge build 1.0, you will have to manually create the keyframes for the playback with these two methods (unless you use john dunning's nifty fireworks plugin.</s><s> look under "exporting animations as edge symbols": http://johndunning.com/fireworks/about/edgeanimate.</s><s>)

1) export png sequence from after effects 2) install the mxp for john dunning's fw->edge export plugin (http://johndunning.com/fireworks/about/edgeanimate) 3) create a multi-state document in fw with each of your pngs in a different state 4) export the animation from fw as an edge symbol (should you export as spritesheet or png sequence?</s><s> spritesheets requires less hits on the server, but if the spritesheet is too big, it won't show up on low memory devices like ipad1, iphone4.</s><s> png sequences cost a lot of hits on the server, but if your animation is small, probably won't exceed the device's memory) 5) import the new symbol into edge (how to: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o7wgftmt58) 
</s><s>if you don't have a recent version of fw, you can manually set keyframes for the png sequence (new image each keyframe) or spritesheet (new position each keyframe).</s><s> in this case, i'd probably run a javascript settimeout timer, to change the values through code, rather than laboriously setting each keyframe on the timeline. 
</s><s>here are the instructions from john dunning's post for the fw/edge workflow: 
exporting animations as edge symbols 
in addition to exporting a fireworks document as an edge project, you can export a multi-state document as an edge animation symbol.</s><s> the animations can be exported as either a series of pngs or a single sprite image.</s><s> when you run the edge animate > export as edge png animation command, you'll be asked to select a directory where the animation will be saved.</s><s> each state in the fireworks document will then be exported as a 32-bit png, as long as its include when exporting option is checked.</s><s> the pngs are added to a timeline, separated from the previous frame by the delay time set in the fireworks states panel.</s><s> (to change the delay, double-click the number to the right of the state name and enter a delay in 1/100ths of a second.</s><s>) the pngs and the timeline code are then bundled together into an .ansym file, which is what edge animate uses to store symbols externally.</s><s> the edge animate > export as edge sprite animation command works similarly, but the animation frames are stacked horizontally in a single wide image.</s><s> the image is clipped to show a single frame's width of the sprite, and itsbackground-position property is animated to show one frame at a time.</s><s> the advantage of the sprite export is that the animation makes just one http request when pre-loading the image, vs. one for each frame in the png export.</s><s> but the very wide images that are created might pose problems in some browsers.</s><s> once the animation is exported, you can click the + button in the symbols section of edge animate's library panel and select import symbols....</s><s> in the resulting dialog, select the .ansym file that you exported from fireworks.</s><s> the looping setting in the states panel controls how the exported animation behaves.</s><s> the default is forever, but you can change it to one of the other options in the menu.

<s>this clarified things for me as well; thanks sarah. 
i am also new to js and jquery.</s><s> how would you target the parent of a nested symbol from the child of that symbol.</s><s> and also... how would you then target an alternate nested symbol of the parent... and ultimately the child of that nested symbol... if you see what i mean

<s>hey andrew, Ê you'll probably be able to do all those things with the code below. Ê Ê access the a symbol timeline within another symbol to access another symbol element from within a symbol, use the following in your event: sym.getcomposition().getstage().getsymbol("symbolname").play(); // gets the stage from the composition level, then gets the symbol and plays the timeline Ê to access a nested symbol timeline from within a symbol, use the following: Ê sym.getcomposition().getstage().getsymbol("symbolname1").getsymbol("sy mbolname2").play(0); // gets the stage from the composition level, gets the parent symbol, then gets the nested symbol timeline Ê you can access elements from within a symbol timeline from within another symbol.</s><s> for example: sym.getcomposition().getstage().getsymbol("kitten_1").$("kitten_paw"). hide(); // gets the symbol element "kitten_1" and hides the element "kitten_paw" Ê access a nested symbol timeline from another symbol to access the timeline of a nested symbol, use the following in your event: Ê sym.getcomposition().getstage().sym.getsymbol("symbolname").getsymbol( "nestedelementname").play(); Ê you can also access elements within a nested symbol from the stage.</s><s> for example: sym.getcomposition().getstage().sym.getsymbol("kitten_1").getsymbol("k itten_paw").$("paw").hide(); // hides the element "paw" from within a nested symbol Ê hope that helps!</s><s> sarah

<s>love new features for which most of us shower you with kudos from all sides... that said you know we are a bunch of demanding scoundrels! ;d 
</s><s>so, in the interest of moving past the congratulatory phase for a milestone worthy of a good pat on the shoulder for a job well done... 
- i wish there was a more visual way to target all existing symbols and elements without having to do all the singing and dancing each time... could be (or not) similart to the targeting in flash although i'd prefer a dropdown listing all the "targetable" elements and symbols (absolute and relative).</s><s> that would be a really a huge help to avoid the trial and error process that is needed each time to get the target to respond to the properties being added or code being attached. 
- i also wish that edge had a way to autocomplete instructions with multiple selectable suggestions (like in intellij idea et sim ides) where code from the linked apis (edge, jquery, custom added ones) would be selectable as the code is being typed by triggering the autocomplete using a modifier key 
- also snippets that could be reused over and over could prove very helpful... is there a way (other than keeping a manual archive in a commented-out code on an unused symbol) tha could serve that purpose? 
</s><s>lastly i've found scoping issues and i don't know if that has anything to do with targeting... but for instance, i could not define and use variables in a symbol unless i had declared on the stage on creationcomplete.</s><s> just to give you an example: i could not do a simple var myvar=0; myvar++; alert (myvar); "inside" a symbol used as a button responding to a click event.</s><s> using the letter "i" withing that click event (since "i" it's likely already declared somewhere in the javascript api, would be perfectly fine as long as not "re-declaring it" using "var".</s><s> the variable myvar could be used without issues once declaring it on stage upon creationcomplete as var myvar = 0; 
...and as usual thanks for keeping up the awesome work!
