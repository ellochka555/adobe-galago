<s>hi stan 
</s><s>the only way i could crack this was to do the bit rate calculations (560/120) allow for some headroom and ensure dolby audio not pcm was used for audio encoding. 
i then encoded the assets in ame and re- import into aen. 
</s><s>it seems happy now - but i had to do what i thought aen was meant to do, i.e., encode the assets to fit the media. 
</s><s>it failed to do so because it would need to transcode below 2mbs which breaks it's rules. 
</s><s>effectively i manually transcoded the assets using a setting of around 4mbs.

<s>in my experience with adobe encore cs6, the software will not cope with squashing the asset sizes to fit everything onto a single layer 4.7gb dvd.

<s>hi stan 
</s><s>the only way i could crack this was to do the bit rate calculations (560/120) allow for some headroom and ensure dolby audio not pcm was used for audio encoding. 
i then encoded the assets in ame and re- import into aen. 
</s><s>it seems happy now - but i had to do what i thought aen was meant to do, i.e., encode the assets to fit the media. 
</s><s>it failed to do so because it would need to transcode below 2mbs which breaks it's rules. 
</s><s>effectively i manually transcoded the assets using a setting of around 4mbs. 
</s><s>the only other difference was reducing the number of timelines.

<subject>Simple button highlights in PSD menu not working properly in Encore</subject>
<post author="cultureofdestruction" timestamp="Jan 20, 2012 4:53 PM">
<s>i'm having some trouble making even basic menus this week - i'm working on a couple of projects that need simple menus on their dvds, but i can't get them to work. 
</s><s>for one project, it's a simple menu with a photo as the background and two buttons - 'play' and 'behind the scenes'.</s><s> each button group consists of a text layer with the button title and a layer called '(=1) highlight'.</s><s> the highlight layer is a simple straight line underneath the text.</s><s> nothing is overlapping, however the line is not appearing on one of the buttons.</s><s> the group is detected as a button in encore, and works when it is linked to the timeline, but the line does not appear 
with the other project i've been working on this week, there's a few menu pages - a main menu, and some chapter select sub menus.</s><s> these menus look a bit fancier, but the buttons are still fairly simple - they basically consist of a line of text, but this time the highlight is a rectangular outline.</s><s> i'm having what looks like the same problem with these menus - the highlights aren't displaying correctly.</s><s> most of the outlines are missing their bottom lines - so only a three-sided box is appearing. 
</s><s>i've made plenty of menus before using the same method, and more complicated ones than this too, without running into any issues.</s><s> i haven't been able to figure out what the problem is, despite starting over and making the menus from scratch several times, and making them one step at a time, importing them into encore at every step to test.</s><s> at some point, one or more of the highlights will always stop working.</s><s> despite this systematic approach, i'm still baffled.</s><s> i'm using photoshop cs5.1 and encore cs5.1.</s><s> after running into problems on one computer i tried making menus from scratch on another computer with the same version software but had the same problem. 

</s><s>has anyone got any suggestions of things i should try that might solve this problem?</s><s> i can send an example of a menu that's not working for me if anyone would like to take a look.

<s>i'm having some trouble making even basic menus this week - i'm working on a couple of projects that need simple menus on their dvds, but i can't get them to work. 
</s><s>for one project, it's a simple menu with a photo as the background and two buttons - 'play' and 'behind the scenes'.</s><s> each button group consists of a text layer with the button title and a layer called '(=1) highlight'.</s><s> the highlight layer is a simple straight line underneath the text.</s><s> nothing is overlapping, however the line is not appearing on one of the buttons.</s><s> the group is detected as a button in encore, and works when it is linked to the timeline, but the line does not appear 
with the other project i've been working on this week, there's a few menu pages - a main menu, and some chapter select sub menus.</s><s> these menus look a bit fancier, but the buttons are still fairly simple - they basically consist of a line of text, but this time the highlight is a rectangular outline.</s><s> i'm having what looks like the same problem with these menus - the highlights aren't displaying correctly.</s><s> most of the outlines are missing their bottom lines - so only a three-sided box is appearing. 
</s><s>i've made plenty of menus before using the same method, and more complicated ones than this too, without running into any issues.</s><s> i haven't been able to figure out what the problem is, despite starting over and making the menus from scratch several times, and making them one step at a time, importing them into encore at every step to test.</s><s> at some point, one or more of the highlights will always stop working.</s><s> despite this systematic approach, i'm still baffled.</s><s> i'm using photoshop cs5.1 and encore cs5.1.</s><s> after running into problems on one computer i tried making menus from scratch on another computer with the same version software but had the same problem. 

</s><s>has anyone got any suggestions of things i should try that might solve this problem?</s><s> i can send an example of a menu that's not working for me if anyone would like to take a look.

<s>there is only form of the mpeg-2 dvd that i know of from pr and it produces 3 files and one of them contains chapter data.</s><s> en writes the video file converts and writes the audio file, and it uses the xml file to specify the chapter markers set in pr.</s><s> one advantage to using this export form is that it is easier to set and anotate the chapter markers in pr than en and there is a better choice of bitrate settings etc. in pr than en.</s><s> and why convert the video to some other format, for example, mp4, to then have en convert to to mpeg2.

i see now ann, in a different thread, you noted that dragging an asset to a menu did not work (this creates a timeine), whereas draggin an asset to a timeline did. 
i can't image what change in cc would produce this difference, but the workaround will be welcome news.

using win7 and internet explorer i just clicked the link i provided in reply #1 and it works perfectly for me 
since encore cs6 "via the cloud" is activated by installing and activating ppro cs6, the only solution i know of for encore cs6 asking for a serial number is to de-and-re-activate premiere pro cs6... which may mean completely uninstalling the ppro/encore cs6 bundle

<s>stan, that is exactly what i am saying.</s><s> the link works, but the task of un-installing and reinstalling is redundant and very time consuming; usually yealiding a fix for a day, only having to be done again and again. 
i think the argument here is that a large portion of adobe clients still produce work for physical media.</s><s> everyone i know who uses adobe cc or the old cs express the same frustration as i do about abandoning encore and physical media creation. 
</s><s>adobe killing encore doesn't make sense to me because physical media is still a viable commodity.</s><s> bestbuy, target, wal-mart all have about an acre of floor space dedicated to dvds, blu-ray, cd's and even vinyl.</s><s> amazon still offers conventional physical media in the aforementioned formats for music, movies, and videogames.</s><s> physical media is not dead.</s><s> i see the trend, i say in about 10 years physical media will be nostolgic but right now it's still in demand and profitable. 
</s><s>most of my business are 18-35 year old brides that not only demand dvd and bluray copies of their weddings but expect; it with out question.</s><s> even a large portion of my corporate clients want the end product on a physical medium such as dvd or blu-ray.</s><s> hollywood produces hundred million dollar productions and still print to physical media such as dvd and blu-ray. 
i enjoy my adobe cc i am a fan of the subscritpion service, it's improved the quality while lowering the cost of what i do, but i am also becoming frustrated with a few product decisions adobe has made recently: dropping encore, and not servicing the issues with premiere pro effects not playing nice with amd video cards.

<s>hi john, 
</s><s>thank you for your reply. 
</s><s>with respect it was not my bad understanding as i joined the creative cloud when the offering was cs6 before the cc release.</s><s> at that time there was no talk off encore being dropped in future releases. 
i am not sure why you thought it necessary to say "(i am a member just like you, so blame adobe)" as i clearly said "if anyone from adobe reads this post please ensure this is fixed as a matter of urgency and please take on board that dvds and blu rays are still a major means of distributing motion pictures and need to be supported" making it obvious i blame adobe. 
</s><s>yes of course encore is end of life but it should still work until it is officially withdrawn.</s><s> it seems strange that a few of us are having the problem within days of each other which is why i am wondering if there is something wrong system that checks our membership and allows us to us to use the products. 
</s><s>after using adobe products since photoshop 3 please credit me with enough intelligence to have worked out that this is a user forum.

since encore cs6 "via the cloud" is activated by installing and activating ppro cs6, the only solution i know of for encore cs6 asking for a serial number is to de-and-re-activate premiere pro cs6... which may mean completely uninstalling the ppro/encore cs6 bundle

<s>stan, that is exactly what i am saying.</s><s> the link works, but the task of un-installing and reinstalling is redundant and very time consuming; usually yealiding a fix for a day, only having to be done again and again. 
i think the argument here is that a large portion of adobe clients still produce work for physical media.</s><s> everyone i know who uses adobe cc or the old cs express the same frustration as i do about abandoning encore and physical media creation. 
</s><s>adobe killing encore doesn't make sense to me because physical media is still a viable commodity.</s><s> bestbuy, target, wal-mart all have about an acre of floor space dedicated to dvds, blu-ray, cd's and even vinyl.</s><s> amazon still offers conventional physical media in the aforementioned formats for music, movies, and videogames.</s><s> physical media is not dead.</s><s> i see the trend, i say in about 10 years physical media will be nostolgic but right now it's still in demand and profitable. 
</s><s>most of my business are 18-35 year old brides that not only demand dvd and bluray copies of their weddings but expect; it with out question.</s><s> even a large portion of my corporate clients want the end product on a physical medium such as dvd or blu-ray.</s><s> hollywood produces hundred million dollar productions and still print to physical media such as dvd and blu-ray. 
i enjoy my adobe cc i am a fan of the subscritpion service, it's improved the quality while lowering the cost of what i do, but i am also becoming frustrated with a few product decisions adobe has made recently: dropping encore, and not servicing the issues with premiere pro effects not playing nice with amd video cards.

<s>hi john, 
</s><s>thank you for your reply.

i am not sure why you thought it necessary to say "(i am a member just like you, so blame adobe)" as i clearly said "if anyone from adobe reads this post please ensure this is fixed as a matter of urgency and please take on board that dvds and blu rays are still a major means of distributing motion pictures and need to be supported" making it obvious i blame adobe. 
</s><s>yes of course encore is end of life but it should still work until it is officially withdrawn.</s><s> it seems strange that a few of us are having the problem within days of each other which is why i am wondering if there is something wrong system that checks our membership and allows us to us to use the products.

<s>hi,   ever since i updated to mavericks, just like a lot of other people, my encore 5.1 would not open.</s><s> i found a solution and now encore runs fine on mavericks.   the solution, posted below.   i only had to do steps 1-4.   good luck.</s><s> i hope it works for you as well.   encore crashing on launch 1. grab digital rebellion's preference manager (free).</s><s> 2. trash encore's preferences.</s><s> 3. empty your trash and restart.</s><s> (if your trash won't empty, restart, then try again.</s><s>) 4. relaunch encore.</s><s> 5. if crashing continues, grab onyx.</s><s> 6. repair permissions, then clean system and user caches.&#8232;7.</s><s> 7. relaunch encore.</s><s> note: these steps should only happen once, not every time you use encore.

<s>hi richard, i'd like to explore what you're saying further, i think we're getting warmer.</s><s> i have no experience in controlling dianorms...what i can tell you is that there are 2 audio tracks, one for dialogue (track 1), the other for opening / closing credits music (track 2). 
</s><s>track 1 dialogue is quiet by comparison, so i cranked the track using the yellow line (with "control nodes" sorry about my newbeeness) in premiere to max (premiere says it's 6db when hovering over yellow line).</s><s> i also raised the track volume with the audio mixer knobs to 4.1 (sorry, it doesn't tell me what unit this is, db?</s><s>).</s><s> 
</s><s>the result is that during playback in premiere, it sounds more or less balanced with the loud track (music).</s><s> the master "volume reading" only "clips" (i.e turns red) in a few spots throughout the video in premiere.</s><s> but this doesn't happen right away, certainly not as soon as the "dropping problem" that occurs 10 seconds into the dialogue. 
</s><s>and again, when the closing music comes on, it blasts in the problematic dvd player, but the whole video sounds fine when played on other dvd players or computer. 
</s><s>does it still sound like the dianorm issue you mention?</s><s> if so, how can i fix it?</s><s>

<s>just had a look at the clip, the opening music is in stereo and the dialogue is left only.</s><s> it is possible that your dvd player is only outputting the right channel.

<s>thanks.</s><s> if the dvd player was only outputting the right channel, then why would the first 10 seconds of the dialogue sound perfect? 
</s><s>also, remember that the problem isn't that the dialogue "disappears", rather gets suddenly, drastically reduced (by a factor of around 75%).</s><s> if my dvd player was only outputting the right channel, wouldn't we be hearing complete silence during dialogue? 
</s><s>another piece of info that may or may not shed light: i have the dialogue track panned hard left...this was done in an earlier attempt to boost the track's volume, since the right channel is completely empty anyway (i.e.</s><s> no visible audio waves in premiere, no matter how much i zoom in). 
</s><s>are phase problems and dianorms ruled out, or still in contention?

<s>i was hearing "regular" dialog volume in the left and much softer, but not absent, in the right.</s><s> i can not guarantee that is not an artifact on this end. 
i think you need to have fixed the audio issue in premiere.</s><s> it sounds like you have a stereo audio track from a source that had a mike in only one channel.</s><s> instead of panning, "fill right" (or left, i always have to check myself on that) so that you get the dialogue in both sides. 
i do not believe you have ruled out a phase issue.</s><s> but i suspect that when you fix the track problem, your audio will be okay.

<s>problem solved...i did as you both said; first i moved the dialogue pan from hard left to center, then "fill left" (a pretty unintuitive term by the way, you'd think "fill right" would mean fill the empty right channel).</s><s> i also followed richard's earlier advice in applying the dynamics effect, though it seems that this wasn't necessarily the root of the problem, but still a good thing for me to learn to do. 
</s><s>thanks to you both, i feel like i've learned 3 topics in one!
