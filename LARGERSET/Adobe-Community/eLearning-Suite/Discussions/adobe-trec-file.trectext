<subject>Adobe's Subscription Policies - something is very, very wrong</subject>
<post author="Chillau" timestamp="Jun 28, 2013 5:23 PM">
<s>hi, 
</s><s>i purchased adobe's elearning 6.1 suite not long ago and, as a newbie, i refer to these forums frequently to find answers to things as i muddle my way through.</s><s> it's really helpful and i am glad these forums exist - thanks! 
</s><s>however this post is not about the products themselves, rather adobe's subscription and pricing policies.</s><s> while searching the forums what has struck me is the extreme anger reflected in many of the posts.</s><s> i use various forums for help but rarely, if ever, have i found such a massive ground swell of angst aimed at the developer's purchasing policies.</s><s> there seems to be a mass of adobe users out there who feel - quoting some of the common terms used - "cheated", "scammed", "trapped" and "furious".</s><s> i have mostly been looking at forums specific to the elearning suite so i can't comment on the views of those who own other adobe products, but the elearning (captivate) guys are clearly far from happy. 
</s><s>the posts also indicate that many feel adobe could not care less about their problems and, given the predicaments the policies have left purchasers in, this certainly rings true. 
</s><s>as an instructional designer it's disappointing for me to have invested a significant amount in a great suite of products (albeit a bit buggy) that will enable me to create accessable and interactive learning programs, only to discover that that the perception is that those who make and market these products are far more concerned with securing dollars than they are with producing a quality product and, in turn, a quality output for me. 
</s><s>if adobe is truely concerned about their customers, the sheer volume of negative comments posted in these forums should have them, if not caring, at least looking seriously at the damaging pr that's being generated.</s><s> as my post heading states - something feels very, very wrong here and i wonder if adobe has any plans to remedy the many problems they have inflicted on their customers? 
i guess i'm just one more voice in an ever-growing crowd ... but hey ...</s><s> i had to say something!

<post author="PMIQ" timestamp="Jun 30, 2013 5:13 AM">
<s>thank you for your comments, and i agree with you that something feels very, very wrong here.    for me, the issue is that i am trying to work out how i move forward following the demise of the e-learning suite i have recently  paid a significant sum to upgrade to a perpetual licenced copy of els6 (upgraded from 5.5 and previously upgraded from 5 and 2 and the original suite).  so i am a long standing customer who has stuck by the products (which i do really like, even though a few too many bugs appear in released versions) i would like to continue to access the programs contained within els, ensuring that i have access to the latest versions of each program i can see that subscribers to els have been given a reasonable upgrade path to cc/ captivate 7 with discounted pricing: "we're pleased to offer every adobe elearning suite annual subscription user who has an active subscription plan as of june 3rd 2013, annual creative cloud membership at no extra cost to you and also free annual subscription for adobe captivate and adobe presenter for one year starting from june 25th 2013.</s><s> your annual commitment date gets reset from june 25, 2013 to june 24, 2014, irrespective of the time remaining in your current contract.</s><s> within the year, after you avail the offer, you will be allowed to cancel the annual creative cloud membership at no cost.</s><s> if you do not want to avail this offer, you can cancel the adobe elearning suite annual subscription without any cancellation fee."  i cannot find a similar deal for current els6 perpetual licence holders?  i would be open to moving to a subscription model if that is the deemed way forward, but having just paid our for an upgrade, and not given any indication of how to move to a subscripion model with the pricing model detailed above, i am lost.   it is not clear why perpetual licence holders of els 6 should be disadvantaged having paid significant sums for recent upgrades?  i now feel like i have paid out with good-will and been left completely stranded.   adobe - could you address these issues please and provide a sensible and cost effective migration path to the subscription model for els licence holders?

<s>hi, 
</s><s>i purchased adobe's elearning 6.1 suite not long ago and, as a newbie, i refer to these forums frequently to find answers to things as i muddle my way through.</s><s> it's really helpful and i am glad these forums exist - thanks! 
</s><s>however this post is not about the products themselves, rather adobe's subscription and pricing policies.</s><s> while searching the forums what has struck me is the extreme anger reflected in many of the posts.</s><s> i use various forums for help but rarely, if ever, have i found such a massive ground swell of angst aimed at the developer's purchasing policies.</s><s> there seems to be a mass of adobe users out there who feel - quoting some of the common terms used - "cheated", "scammed", "trapped" and "furious".</s><s> i have mostly been looking at forums specific to the elearning suite so i can't comment on the views of those who own other adobe products, but the elearning (captivate) guys are clearly far from happy. 
</s><s>the posts also indicate that many feel adobe could not care less about their problems and, given the predicaments the policies have left purchasers in, this certainly rings true. 
</s><s>as an instructional designer it's disappointing for me to have invested a significant amount in a great suite of products (albeit a bit buggy) that will enable me to create accessable and interactive learning programs, only to discover that that the perception is that those who make and market these products are far more concerned with securing dollars than they are with producing a quality product and, in turn, a quality output for me. 
</s><s>if adobe is truely concerned about their customers, the sheer volume of negative comments posted in these forums should have them, if not caring, at least looking seriously at the damaging pr that's being generated.</s><s> as my post heading states - something feels very, very wrong here and i wonder if adobe has any plans to remedy the many problems they have inflicted on their customers? 
i guess i'm just one more voice in an ever-growing crowd ... but hey ...</s><s> i had to say something!

<s>thank you for your comments, and i agree with you that something feels very, very wrong here.    for me, the issue is that i am trying to work out how i move forward following the demise of the e-learning suite i have recently  paid a significant sum to upgrade to a perpetual licenced copy of els6 (upgraded from 5.5 and previously upgraded from 5 and 2 and the original suite).  so i am a long standing customer who has stuck by the products (which i do really like, even though a few too many bugs appear in released versions) i would like to continue to access the programs contained within els, ensuring that i have access to the latest versions of each program i can see that subscribers to els have been given a reasonable upgrade path to cc/ captivate 7 with discounted pricing: "we're pleased to offer every adobe elearning suite annual subscription user who has an active subscription plan as of june 3rd 2013, annual creative cloud membership at no extra cost to you and also free annual subscription for adobe captivate and adobe presenter for one year starting from june 25th 2013.</s><s> your annual commitment date gets reset from june 25, 2013 to june 24, 2014, irrespective of the time remaining in your current contract.</s><s> within the year, after you avail the offer, you will be allowed to cancel the annual creative cloud membership at no cost.</s><s> if you do not want to avail this offer, you can cancel the adobe elearning suite annual subscription without any cancellation fee."  i cannot find a similar deal for current els6 perpetual licence holders?  i would be open to moving to a subscription model if that is the deemed way forward, but having just paid our for an upgrade, and not given any indication of how to move to a subscripion model with the pricing model detailed above, i am lost.   it is not clear why perpetual licence holders of els 6 should be disadvantaged having paid significant sums for recent upgrades?  i now feel like i have paid out with good-will and been left completely stranded.   adobe - could you address these issues please and provide a sensible and cost effective migration path to the subscription model for els licence holders?
