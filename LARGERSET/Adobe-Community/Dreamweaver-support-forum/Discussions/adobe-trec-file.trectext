i tested and it worked fine for me this end. 
</s><s>are you still not receiving any information in your email box? 
</s><s>also where are you putting the php code?</s><s> there is no action set on your form so it would need to go at the top of the page your form is located on........i presume it is there?</s><s> if it is there you would also need a mechanism in place to stop the php executing until the submit button is clicked - regardless of this you should still have received a blank email.

<s>you don't need to do this because the mobile layout is % width up to a max-width of 480px.</s><s> so it covers any size mobile device from 0 to 480 landscape.

<s>you're loading jquery and isotope before you run this code, correct?</s><s> also you're waiting for the document to finish loading as well too correct? 
</s><s>i'm going to be a little verbose but this should help you a bunch in the future. 
</s><s>you're using jquery to grab a htmlelement with the id of 'portfolio-grid', seen here: 
<quote>
<s>var gr = jquery('#portfolio-grid'); 
</s></quote>
</s><s>the next code is an if/else statement.</s><s> the 'else' portion is firing off.</s><s> the very first line in that else block is the statement that is erroring, telling you that the object you defined above ('gr') does not support the method isotope(): 
<quote>
<s>gr.isotope({ // ... 
</s></quote>
</s><s>typically that means 'gr' has not been defined (jquery couldn't find it) or the isotype functionality has not been added.</s><s> to know, you use your javascript debugger built into your browser (most) to inspect your code.</s><s> you should set a breakpoint on the line that is erroring.</s><s> it will tell you if gr is defined. 
</s><s>to illustrate (a simple pure javascript example) using internet explorer (11) to do that i'd open the developer tools (f12, but the tools will look different in ie8).</s><s> i'd select the debugger which will show me the code with line numbers.</s><s> if you click on the line number i mentioned above and reload the page the debugger will stop on that line of code and let you peek at it under the hood. 
</s><s>in this example you see i defined the variable 'x'.</s><s> after the window finishes loading i check to see what that variable contains.</s><s> notice it contains 'null'.</s><s> the reason why is i did not wait for the document to finish loading before i tried to assign it and the <p id="sometext"> didn't even exist yet, so x is undefined (or null). 


</s><s>if i tried to use the variable to run a function on it, i'd get the same error you got. 
</s><s>now if i wait for the document to load before defining 'x' then it will be different, because the htmlparagraphelement has loaded: 


</s><s>your scenario could be the same.</s><s> make sure you wait for the page to load before you run code on elements that should be on it. 
</s><s>the easiest jquery (browser compatible) way to wait for when the document loads is just to put your code inside this: 
<quote>
<s>jquery(document).ready(function() { // your code here }); 
</s></quote>
</s><s>inspect your 'gr' variable with the way illustrated above and if your debugger reports 'gr' is null or undefined, you know jquery isn't finding that html element, therefore it has no isotope() method and is erroring. 
</s><s>another perhaps easier way is to use the javascript console and forget about the debugger and see what it outputs for gr.</s><s> an example of that (this time using chrome's developer console, ctrl+shift+j): 


</s><s>now switch the source back to define 'x' after the window loads and it's a valid object: 


</s><s>you should use the debugger method for more control and contextual awareness but the console is easy to use.

<s>to sum up the response above, i advised that you wait until your page loads completely before trying any scripts.</s><s> the window.addeventlistener('load',functionhere); as i did above is one way to 'wait' until the page loads.</s><s> if you do so, jquery may be able to find your #portfolio-grid. Ê to be easy for now, go in your code to line 120 where it's erroring and before that line try this: Ê // ...</s><s> } else { Ê ÊÊÊÊ // is gr defined? ÊÊÊÊ alert(gr); ÊÊÊÊ // if so, check if isotope exists as a function ÊÊÊÊ if (gr) { alert(gr.isotope); } ÊÊÊÊ ÊÊÊÊ gr.isotope({ ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ // continue...</s><s> if it comes up as null or undefined, you'll know jquery cannot find what you assigned to gr (jquery('#portfolio-grid');). Ê if it comes back as [object object], then try alerting the isotope function as seen, which might return a tostring() version of that function or simply that it is a function. Ê if the second alert runs and returns null or undefined, then the isotope addon is missing from that page and isn't extending jquery.</s><s> you'd need to look at the scripts you're loading, especially the order (load jquery first).

<s>you're loading jquery and isotope before you run this code, correct?</s><s> also you're waiting for the document to finish loading as well too correct? 
</s><s>i'm going to be a little verbose but this should help you a bunch in the future. 
</s><s>you're using jquery to grab a htmlelement with the id of 'portfolio-grid', seen here: 
<quote>
<s>var gr = jquery('#portfolio-grid'); 
</s></quote>
</s><s>the next code is an if/else statement.</s><s> the 'else' portion is firing off.</s><s> the very first line in that else block is the statement that is erroring, telling you that the object you defined above ('gr') does not support the method isotope(): 
<quote>
<s>gr.isotope({ // ... 
</s></quote>
</s><s>typically that means 'gr' has not been defined (jquery couldn't find it) or the isotype functionality has not been added.</s><s> to know, you use your javascript debugger built into your browser (most) to inspect your code.</s><s> you should set a breakpoint on the line that is erroring.</s><s> it will tell you if gr is defined. 
</s><s>to illustrate (a simple pure javascript example) using internet explorer (11) to do that i'd open the developer tools (f12, but the tools will look different in ie8).</s><s> i'd select the debugger which will show me the code with line numbers.</s><s> if you click on the line number i mentioned above and reload the page the debugger will stop on that line of code and let you peek at it under the hood. 
</s><s>in this example you see i defined the variable 'x'.</s><s> after the window finishes loading i check to see what that variable contains.</s><s> notice it contains 'null'.</s><s> the reason why is i did not wait for the document to finish loading before i tried to assign it and the <p id="sometext"> didn't even exist yet, so x is undefined (or null). 


</s><s>if i tried to use the variable to run a function on it, i'd get the same error you got. 
</s><s>now if i wait for the document to load before defining 'x' then it will be different, because the htmlparagraphelement has loaded: 


</s><s>your scenario could be the same.</s><s> make sure you wait for the page to load before you run code on elements that should be on it. 
</s><s>the easiest jquery (browser compatible) way to wait for when the document loads is just to put your code inside this: 
<quote>
<s>jquery(document).ready(function() { // your code here }); 
</s></quote>
</s><s>inspect your 'gr' variable with the way illustrated above and if your debugger reports 'gr' is null or undefined, you know jquery isn't finding that html element, therefore it has no isotope() method and is erroring. 
</s><s>another perhaps easier way is to use the javascript console and forget about the debugger and see what it outputs for gr.</s><s> an example of that (this time using chrome's developer console, ctrl+shift+j): 


</s><s>now switch the source back to define 'x' after the window loads and it's a valid object: 


</s><s>you should use the debugger method for more control and contextual awareness but the console is easy to use.

<s>to sum up the response above, i advised that you wait until your page loads completely before trying any scripts.</s><s> the window.addeventlistener('load',functionhere); as i did above is one way to 'wait' until the page loads.</s><s> if you do so, jquery may be able to find your #portfolio-grid. Ê to be easy for now, go in your code to line 120 where it's erroring and before that line try this: Ê // ...</s><s> } else { Ê ÊÊÊÊ // is gr defined? ÊÊÊÊ alert(gr); ÊÊÊÊ // if so, check if isotope exists as a function ÊÊÊÊ if (gr) { alert(gr.isotope); } ÊÊÊÊ ÊÊÊÊ gr.isotope({ ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ // continue...</s><s> if it comes up as null or undefined, you'll know jquery cannot find what you assigned to gr (jquery('#portfolio-grid');). Ê if it comes back as [object object], then try alerting the isotope function as seen, which might return a tostring() version of that function or simply that it is a function. Ê if the second alert runs and returns null or undefined, then the isotope addon is missing from that page and isn't extending jquery.</s><s> you'd need to look at the scripts you're loading, especially the order (load jquery first).

<s>please let me know when you have a solution to this issue as well.</s><s> i have had this issue with dreamweaver ever since mavericks and the dreamweaver update. 
i do not use @import code (don't use bootstrap) 
</s><s>with a recent update my pages seem to load faster... but all i have to do is click around on various images on my page within dreamweaver... and i'm not "changing" anyhting... just randomly clicking images placed on a page... and within a couple clicks dreamweaver has become so slow to "follow" my random clicks that it starts moving my images around -- in other words, it reaches a point where it's recognized the down-click but not the up-click of the mouse and is therefore 'moving' images rather than just selecting the different images.

<s>i just spent over an hour on the phone with adobe's support.</s><s> it is finally resolve.</s><s> it was a permissions issue.</s><s> basically, what the tech had to do was create a "root user" account, sign out of my account, sign into root user, uninstall dreamweaver, then re-install dreamweaver in the root user account.</s><s> since the root user account has full permissions, it worked.</s><s> i definitely would not have figured that out without calling support and having a rep walk me through it.</s><s> i didn't come across this solution on any forums i searched. 
i also had a duplicate macintosh hd drive apparently in the root user account that caused some confusion with install, so he had to pull that out onto the desktop also to avoid confusion with the install, but my guess is that wont be an issue for others.

<s>i just spent over an hour on the phone with adobe's support.</s><s> it is finally resolve.</s><s> it was a permissions issue.</s><s> basically, what the tech had to do was create a "root user" account, sign out of my account, sign into root user, uninstall dreamweaver, then re-install dreamweaver in the root user account.</s><s> since the root user account has full permissions, it worked.</s><s> i definitely would not have figured that out without calling support and having a rep walk me through it.</s><s> i didn't come across this solution on any forums i searched. 
i also had a duplicate macintosh hd drive apparently in the root user account that caused some confusion with install, so he had to pull that out onto the desktop also to avoid confusion with the install, but my guess is that wont be an issue for others.

<subject>Why can't Chrome find the webpage when Previewing in Browser?</subject>
<post author="jl2000" timestamp="Mar 17, 2014 1:41 PM">
<s>hi - this is thoroughly bizarre to me.</s><s> i can preview any site i'm working on using any browser i have except chrome (current version 33.0.1750.152). 
</s><s>as an example - when i use preview in browser - chrome says "the webpage is not found" - the path to the page is: file://external-drive/_projects/client/_files-from-client/_site-031614 /index.html 
my next step is to manually navigate to the page using chrome's file/open.</s><s> this works perfectly but when the page appears the path is different: file:///volumes/external-drive/_projects/client/_files-from-client/_site-031614/index.html 
</s><s>this second path is the same path in the manage sites/site/local site folder line.</s><s> all other browsers (ffox, safari, opera) use this second path.</s><s> but for some reason chrome has shortened the path to an incorrect address.</s><s> weird!</s><s> 
</s><s>i don't think this is related to mavericks because it was happening before that upgrade. 
</s><s>has anyone else had this happen?</s><s> can anyone explain how i can fix this? 
</s><s>tia your insight.

<subject>Why can't Chrome find the webpage when Previewing in Browser?</subject>
<post author="jl2000" timestamp="Mar 17, 2014 1:41 PM">
<s>hi - this is thoroughly bizarre to me.</s><s> i can preview any site i'm working on using any browser i have except chrome (current version 33.0.1750.152). 
</s><s>as an example - when i use preview in browser - chrome says "the webpage is not found" - the path to the page is: file://external-drive/_projects/client/_files-from-client/_site-031614 /index.html 
my next step is to manually navigate to the page using chrome's file/open.</s><s> this works perfectly but when the page appears the path is different: file:///volumes/external-drive/_projects/client/_files-from-client/_site-031614/index.html 
</s><s>this second path is the same path in the manage sites/site/local site folder line.</s><s> all other browsers (ffox, safari, opera) use this second path.</s><s> but for some reason chrome has shortened the path to an incorrect address.</s><s> weird!</s><s> 
</s><s>i don't think this is related to mavericks because it was happening before that upgrade. 
</s><s>has anyone else had this happen?</s><s> can anyone explain how i can fix this? 
</s><s>tia your insight. 
</s><s>jl2 
</s><s>btw - other details: dreamweaver version 12 (cs6), mac os x 10.9.2.

</s><s>yes, i have no idea why.</s><s> sometimes chrome will find the file for one time only when i use 'preview in chrome' via dw then i'll have to to use the 'file open' method as the page usually cannot be found using 'preview in chrome'.

<s>i have recently found that the database connection strings that dreamweaver auto-generates and other examples on the web use "username" double quotes to encapsulte the variable values. 
</s><s>old way: $hostname_memconn = "localhost"; $database_memconn = "chopinau_membership"; $username_memconn = "chopinau_admin"; $password_memconn = "xxxxxxxxxxxx"; 
new way: $hostname_memconn = 'localhost'; $database_memconn = 'chopinau_membership'; $username_memconn = 'chopinau_admin'; $password_memconn = 'xxxxxxxxxxxx'; 
i hope this saves someone the hours that i had to spend while knowing for sure that all along my credentials were correct.

<subject>Fluid Grid Layout - 2 Divs - Side by Side - Use 100% of Container</subject>
<post author="LittleRiverBB" timestamp="Mar 17, 2014 2:52 PM">
<s>i am recreating my site using fluid grid layouts and have half a dozen divs on the page but i am having a problem getting divs to use 100% of the grid container's width.</s><s> parameters and example: 
the grid container has a tan background color while div logo and div social buttons have a dark blue background color 
if i set div logo width to 25% and div social buttons to 75%, it uses up the entire width of my page, however, when i preview in my browser and shrink the browser window down towards tablet size, it almost immediately knocks div social buttons down to the next line (before it hits the official tablet width and layout). 
</s><s>if i set div logo width to 25% and div social buttons to 72%, shrinking the browser window down towards tablet size works perfectly.</s><s> however, when in full width browser mode, there is a vertical line of tan (background) showing through because my two divs are not actually using 100% of the width.</s><s> if i float div social buttons to the left, the vertical tan line is in the right margin.</s><s> if i float div social buttons to the right, the vertical tan line separates the two divs. 
i could set this up as one big div but i don't think it would behanve the way i want it to when i shrink it down to mobile size. 
i could also change the container's background color to dark blue so the vertical line blends away but i then have the same issue with two divs further below on the page where two divs that have other background colors would not look properly.

</s><s>i'm wanting to create a simple contact form so people can submit a message which will then be sent to one email address (my first time doing this). 
</s><s>using tutorials and a bit of code from our hosting provider i've written the code below.

</s><s>i'm not sure if i've gone about this the right way. 
i realise that i'll have to redirect the path for the 'thanks' and 'error' pages at the bottom to my local mamp htdocs folder, but i'm not given the option to browse for these files and just shown the 'bind to dynamic source' icon.

<s>the reason why nancy thinks you're using pearl to do your form processing is because of this line: 
<form method="post" action="http://www.our_domain.co.uk/cgi-bin/formmail.pl" accept-charset="iso-8859-1" onsubmit="var originalcharset = document.charset; document.charset = 'iso-8859-1'; window.onbeforeunload = function () {document.charset=originalcharset;};"> 
</s><s>specifically, what you are doing is that when someone presses the "submit" button, the result is to call a file called formmail.pl and any filename with the .pl extension is perl. 
a file that uses php will end in .php. 
</s><s>if you are using mamp (or wamp) one issue you may have is that you have not installed a php mail handler.</s><s> on a regular web server, there is usually an email sending application that runs in the background on that server.</s><s> mamp and wamp may not include that.</s><s> they also may not include php or perl, either. 
</s><s>here is the start of the form that calls a php file to send email from one of my websites: 
<form method="post" action="sendmail.php"> 
</s><s>now, here, you're seeing that i am calling a php forms processor called sendmail.php.</s><s> that processor does all of my heavy lifting. 
</s><s>you can see the entire form here (and it's pretty basic): 
http://ghostsofnewengland.org/contact.php 
i do all of the form checking in php.</s><s> i'm not using spry-which adobe dumped, by the way.</s><s> spry reveals itself to the user and i don't think it's as safe as checking things using a server-side script.</s><s> frankly, niether does nancy. 
</s><s>is there any place we can see your page, other than on your own computer?

<s>you can style your forms any way you wish with css. 
</s><s>client side validation (spry) is not reliable.</s><s> it uses the end user's browser & javascript.</s><s> if js is turned off, it won't do anything.</s><s> also, robots never use javascript.</s><s> so don't use js for anything important. 
</s><s>always use server-side scripts (php) to gather, validate and process form data.</s><s> this does not rely on the end user's browser settings and is thus very reliable.

<post author="mhollis55" timestamp="Nov 9, 2013 1:54 PM">
<s>the reason why nancy thinks you're using pearl to do your form processing is because of this line: 
<form method="post" action="http://www.our_domain.co.uk/cgi-bin/formmail.pl" accept-charset="iso-8859-1" onsubmit="var originalcharset = document.charset; document.charset = 'iso-8859-1'; window.onbeforeunload = function () {document.charset=originalcharset;};"> 
</s><s>specifically, what you are doing is that when someone presses the "submit" button, the result is to call a file called formmail.pl and any filename with the .pl extension is perl. 
a file that uses php will end in .php. 
</s><s>if you are using mamp (or wamp) one issue you may have is that you have not installed a php mail handler.</s><s> on a regular web server, there is usually an email sending application that runs in the background on that server.</s><s> mamp and wamp may not include that.</s><s> they also may not include php or perl, either. 
</s><s>here is the start of the form that calls a php file to send email from one of my websites: 
<form method="post" action="sendmail.php"> 
</s><s>now, here, you're seeing that i am calling a php forms processor called sendmail.php.</s><s> that processor does all of my heavy lifting. 
</s><s>you can see the entire form here (and it's pretty basic): 
http://ghostsofnewengland.org/contact.php 
i do all of the form checking in php.</s><s> i'm not using spry-which adobe dumped, by the way.</s><s> spry reveals itself to the user and i don't think it's as safe as checking things using a server-side script.</s><s> frankly, niether does nancy. 
</s><s>is there any place we can see your page, other than on your own computer?

<s>the reason it was removed is there is absolutely no reason for it anymore, it was dropped from html back in html4.</s><s> using an anchor tag in this manner is just not necessary.</s><s> the "new" way is much more flexible and iirc, takes one less step in design view and ultimately creates leaner code (faster downloads, albeit only slightly). 
</s><s>to make a link that goes to a specific spot in your page, you only need to know the html id of the element you want to link to. 
</s><s>in nancy's example, all you do from the design view of dw is highlight the text/image you want to turn into a link and enter #foo as the link itself and you get the exact same affect as putting a named anchor in the beginning of the <div id="foo"> and then adding a link to it. 
</s><s>if you want to add more "anchors" within a long single container (a list of q&a for example), you can highlight any text/image in design view and then in the properties inspector, add an id.</s><s> that will create a set of <span> tags around the text/image with an html id that you can reference by simply adding #the_id_name to the link field in the properties inspector. 
</s><s>so instead of making the page, then adding anchors, then linking to them, you can make the page and link to the ids of the elements on the page, any element, not just <a> tags.

<s>the reason it was removed is there is absolutely no reason for it anymore, it was dropped from html back in html4.</s><s> using an anchor tag in this manner is just not necessary.</s><s> the "new" way is much more flexible and iirc, takes one less step in design view and ultimately creates leaner code (faster downloads, albeit only slightly). 
</s><s>to make a link that goes to a specific spot in your page, you only need to know the html id of the element you want to link to. 
</s><s>in nancy's example, all you do from the design view of dw is highlight the text/image you want to turn into a link and enter #foo as the link itself and you get the exact same affect as putting a named anchor in the beginning of the <div id="foo"> and then adding a link to it. 
</s><s>if you want to add more "anchors" within a long single container (a list of q&a for example), you can highlight any text/image in design view and then in the properties inspector, add an id.</s><s> that will create a set of <span> tags around the text/image with an html id that you can reference by simply adding #the_id_name to the link field in the properties inspector. 
</s><s>so instead of making the page, then adding anchors, then linking to them, you can make the page and link to the ids of the elements on the page, any element, not just <a> tags.

</s><s>the one nancy's diverse web links, this provide more thoughtful perspective about mobile first concept and the whole nine yards.</s><s> this means more thoughtful consideration for designing website that "fit" all kinds regardless of one device.</s><s> again, there are many different smartphone sizes, tablet size, so on.

<s>nancy, 
</s><s>thanks for providing thoughtful diverse links that you provided. 
</s><s>well, as for other posters posted with interesting perspectives, facts, reasons and all.</s><s> all are valid. 
</s><s>at one point, i agree with david powers about his comment about there is no such a web standard for web browsers. 
i am certain that david knows that lot of web standard has transformed from glory days of introduction of html and css back in 1990s.</s><s> there isn't such a standard for smartphone or tablet in those days. 
</s><s>lot has changed from 1990s to now, so in case of david power's comment can be true.</s><s> but if we view 1200 pixel of website loaded with huge image files onto smartphone while using mobile cellular access, is this a good comment to support this perspective.</s><s> i don't think so. 
</s><s>unfortunately, we don't have total control of web users these days where many of them have the luxury of having access to smartphone, tablet or desktop computer as well as laptop.</s><s> the web trend shows that more and more browsing trend is widely used by smartphone and tablet as opposed to desktop and laptop. 
</s><s>the one nancy's diverse web links, this provide more thoughtful perspective about mobile first concept and the whole nine yards.</s><s> this means more thoughtful consideration for designing website that "fit" all kinds regardless of one device.</s><s> again, there are many different smartphone sizes, tablet size, so on. 
</s><s>it would be wise to take a good hard look at all options, then test the water to see if the water is fine, then jump in.</s><s> i think this analogy holds very true i'd web standard-ism.

<s>dear ben, 
</s><s>problem with the wrapper that i have faced is not simply about enclosing the wrapper into the <body> tag.</s><s> surely i'm not the smartest around here, but smarter than that.</s><s> every time i insert a new element the code gets written just after the <body> tag.</s><s> let me exemplify. 
</s><s>let's say i do it according to what it should like, the <body> tag first, the opening centering wrapper ("mainarea") second, with all other divs following afterwards: <body> <div id="mainarea"> <div id="apdiv65"><img src="ico/certified.png" width="81" height="101" /></div> 
</s><s>now, if i were to draw a new ap div using the design mode, say it would be apdiv66 in this case, it somehow would jump just after the <body> tag, thus falling outside the centering wrapper.</s><s> i would have to cut and paste the centering wrapper <div id="mainarea"> every time i draw new ap divs.</s><s> example below: 
<body> <div id="apdiv66"></div> ---- this apdiv would fall outside and will not center <div id="mainarea"> <div id="apdiv65"><img src="ico/certified.png" width="81" height="101" /></div> 
i decided to check if placing the centering wrapper in the <head> tag would solve the issue of new ap divs and it did. 
</s><s>regarding the position.</s><s> whenever i draw an apdiv within the dreamweaver (yes, i draw them in the design mode) the "position: absolute;" gets written alongside with the right, left, top, width and z-index properties automatically.</s><s> if i were to take it out, the ap div appear at the left corner of the document.</s><s> or am i talking about a different positioning? 
i agree that creating a unique style for every ap div is sometimes time-consuming (unless one uses copy-paste from the existing nearby elements).</s><s> i will look into the classes and styles.</s><s> thank you for the advice.

<s>thanks for all Ê first think guys im not a web developer iam a graphic designer i do my design in illustrator or some times photoshop and flash and then go to dreamweaver Ê to make my points to the programers in my company and make them understand my design i draw the website in dreamweaver with the apdivs Ê so i don't care if it's the not best selution or not effective or not powerful or old or any word you said i just don't care Ê and i don't want to use the old dreamweaver it's disgusting that i update all my adobe programs and get used to the new designs and stick with dreamweaver cs6 it's just a stupid Ê and why they remove it anyway. they didn't remove the (red eye removal tool) from the photoshop .it never work's but you can't judge who and how they use it ?</s><s>?</s><s> and i know there is so many graphic designer work in the web design like me and do the samethings that i do because it's the best tool for us Ê thanks for all

<s>dear ben, 
</s><s>problem with the wrapper that i have faced is not simply about enclosing the wrapper into the <body> tag.</s><s> surely i'm not the smartest around here, but smarter than that.</s><s> every time i insert a new element the code gets written just after the <body> tag.</s><s> let me exemplify. 
</s><s>let's say i do it according to what it should like, the <body> tag first, the opening centering wrapper ("mainarea") second, with all other divs following afterwards: <body> <div id="mainarea"> <div id="apdiv65"><img src="ico/certified.png" width="81" height="101" /></div> 
</s><s>now, if i were to draw a new ap div using the design mode, say it would be apdiv66 in this case, it somehow would jump just after the <body> tag, thus falling outside the centering wrapper.</s><s> i would have to cut and paste the centering wrapper <div id="mainarea"> every time i draw new ap divs.</s><s> example below: 
<body> <div id="apdiv66"></div> ---- this apdiv would fall outside and will not center <div id="mainarea"> <div id="apdiv65"><img src="ico/certified.png" width="81" height="101" /></div> 
i decided to check if placing the centering wrapper in the <head> tag would solve the issue of new ap divs and it did. 
</s><s>regarding the position.</s><s> whenever i draw an apdiv within the dreamweaver (yes, i draw them in the design mode) the "position: absolute;" gets written alongside with the right, left, top, width and z-index properties automatically.</s><s> if i were to take it out, the ap div appear at the left corner of the document.</s><s> or am i talking about a different positioning? 
i agree that creating a unique style for every ap div is sometimes time-consuming (unless one uses copy-paste from the existing nearby elements).</s><s> i will look into the classes and styles.</s><s> thank you for the advice.

<s>yes, you can use dreamweaver to create an email marketing piece.</s><s> the problem with dreamweaver, though, is that it produces good clean html code.</s><s> when you produce an email marketing piece, you are not creating it for web browsers but for email applications that are way behind in html and css technology and you have to write html code from the stone age with a lot of deprecated tags and inline css.</s><s> images need absolute paths.

<s>probably be a good idea. 
1: you want an external style sheet that is not a web page with html in it.</s><s> 2: you want to link to your stylesheet as murray suggests in each page.</s><s> 3: you want to lay out your pages carefully so that you are compliant with w3c standards*

</s><s>an external style sheet loads once for all pages in your website, so it can be stored in the browser's memory and each successive page loads faster. 
</s><s>it keeps css out of your html page.</s><s> that's simply better organization. 
</s><s>since dreamweaver allows you to have multiple documents open at the same time, you can easily flip back and forth between your css and your web page.</s><s> you can also access your css from within the web page, applying style changes that, when you do a save all will put them into your stylesheet. 
*to determine whether or not your page is compliant with w3c standards, use the validator.

<s>sorry this is delayed.</s><s> i have been working- 
here's what you do: 
open up dreamweaver.</s><s> go to the defined site for mifflin juniata in dreamweaver. 
</s><s>pull down file>new- 
from the pick list, select blank page and choose css.</s><s> click create.</s><s> 
</s><s>that will open up a blank page that has 4 lines of code.</s><s> lines 1 and 2 will be: 
@charset "utf-8"; /* css document */ 
now, go to the code for your first page, which is what you have been working on. 
</s><s>you'll see the css, it starts with: 
body { font: 100% verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; background: 000000; margin: 0; padding: 0; color: #ffffff; background-color: #000000; border: 10 px; background-image: url(<img src="graphics/blackbg.jpg" width="1024" height="658" />); } and continues until 
a { font-family: palatino linotype, book antiqua, palatino, serif; } 
</s><s>now, one of the things i do note is that all of this css apparently lies between html comment markers and i have to wonder about that. 
</s><s>so, once you have pasted all of that into the new style sheet, save it as "styles.css" 
</s><s>now, you're going to wipe out all of the stuff on that html page from line 8 to line 128 and get rid of the </style> closing tag.</s><s> the ie conditional stuff can stay. 
</s><s>next, you want to link your html page to the external style sheet thusly. 
</s><s>go to your styles panel in dreamweaver.you'll see a little link icon that looks like a couple of chain links. hover your mouse over that and it will say "attach style sheet" this should be in the styles panel on the right-hand side of your screen in dreamweaver cs4.</s><s> and you want to have the css styles tab selected in the top right and not ap elements or tag inspector selected. 
</s><s>click on that link. 
</s><s>by default, dreamweaver will offer to add the file as a link.</s><s> click on the "browse" button and navigate to the styles.css document you just created.</s><s> click choose.</s><s> in the media: box, choose all from the list. 
</s><s>click ok.</s><s> 
</s><s>boom!</s><s> you have just created and attached an external style sheet.</s><s> changes to that one style sheet will affect all pages that are linked to it. 
</s><s>go through the rest of your pages and get rid of the styles that are in the rest of them (except ie conditional ones that begin with: 
<!--[if ie 5]> 
and end with 
<!</s><s>[endif]--> 
</s><s>now, if you do this on your template (as your documents seem to be based on a template- it should update all pages and clear out the css at the top of all of them.

<s>probably be a good idea. 
1: you want an external style sheet that is not a web page with html in it.</s><s> 2: you want to link to your stylesheet as murray suggests in each page.</s><s> 3: you want to lay out your pages carefully so that you are compliant with w3c standards* 
here are the plusses in having a style sheet be external: 
your client wants you to change something.</s><s> change the style and boom!</s><s> all pages change.</s><s> i have done complete websites and had a client say he wants a lighter color for a background, or didn't like my choice of link color.</s><s> one quick change and you're done and all pages look like that. 
</s><s>an external style sheet loads once for all pages in your website, so it can be stored in the browser's memory and each successive page loads faster. 
</s><s>it keeps css out of your html page.</s><s> that's simply better organization. 
</s><s>since dreamweaver allows you to have multiple documents open at the same time, you can easily flip back and forth between your css and your web page.</s><s> you can also access your css from within the web page, applying style changes that, when you do a save all will put them into your stylesheet. 
*to determine whether or not your page is compliant with w3c standards, use the validator. 
</s><s>if you have more questions, you can ask here and we do recommend that you provide a link to the page on your server.</s><s> it's easier for us to see what is happening.

<s>sorry this is delayed.</s><s> i have been working- 
here's what you do: 
open up dreamweaver.</s><s> go to the defined site for mifflin juniata in dreamweaver. 
</s><s>pull down file>new- 
from the pick list, select blank page and choose css.</s><s> click create.</s><s> 
</s><s>that will open up a blank page that has 4 lines of code.</s><s> lines 1 and 2 will be: 
@charset "utf-8"; /* css document */ 
now, go to the code for your first page, which is what you have been working on. 
</s><s>you'll see the css, it starts with: 
body { font: 100% verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; background: 000000; margin: 0; padding: 0; color: #ffffff; background-color: #000000; border: 10 px; background-image: url(<img src="graphics/blackbg.jpg" width="1024" height="658" />); } and continues until 
a { font-family: palatino linotype, book antiqua, palatino, serif; } 
</s><s>now, one of the things i do note is that all of this css apparently lies between html comment markers and i have to wonder about that. 
</s><s>so, once you have pasted all of that into the new style sheet, save it as "styles.css" 
</s><s>now, you're going to wipe out all of the stuff on that html page from line 8 to line 128 and get rid of the </style> closing tag.</s><s> the ie conditional stuff can stay. 
</s><s>next, you want to link your html page to the external style sheet thusly. 
</s><s>go to your styles panel in dreamweaver.you'll see a little link icon that looks like a couple of chain links. hover your mouse over that and it will say "attach style sheet" this should be in the styles panel on the right-hand side of your screen in dreamweaver cs4.</s><s> and you want to have the css styles tab selected in the top right and not ap elements or tag inspector selected. 
</s><s>click on that link. 
</s><s>by default, dreamweaver will offer to add the file as a link.</s><s> click on the "browse" button and navigate to the styles.css document you just created.</s><s> click choose.</s><s> in the media: box, choose all from the list. 
</s><s>click ok.</s><s> 
</s><s>boom!</s><s> you have just created and attached an external style sheet.</s><s> changes to that one style sheet will affect all pages that are linked to it. 
</s><s>go through the rest of your pages and get rid of the styles that are in the rest of them (except ie conditional ones that begin with: 
<!--[if ie 5]> 
and end with 
<!</s><s>[endif]--> 
</s><s>now, if you do this on your template (as your documents seem to be based on a template- it should update all pages and clear out the css at the top of all of them.

<s>dear micheal, Ê hi. Ê i am also in the process of converting a go live site to dw.</s><s> it is not so painless as adobe would lead us to believe and as you have found out.

</s><s>links relative to changes the relative path of the links you create to other pages in the site.</s><s> by default, dreamweaver creates links using document-relative paths.</s><s> select the site root option to change the path setting and make sure that you specify the http address in the http address option.</s><s> changing this setting does not convert the path of existing links; the setting will only apply to new links you create visually with dreamweaver.</s><s> content linked with a site root-relative path does not appear when you preview documents in a local browser unless you specify a testing server, or select the preview using temporary file option in edit > preferences > preview in browser.</s><s> this is because browsers don't recognize site roots-servers do.</s><s> http address the url that your website will use.</s><s> this enables dreamweaver to verify links within the site that use absolute urls or site root-relative paths.</s><s> dreamweaver also uses this address to make sure site root-relative links work on the remote server, which may have a different site root.</s><s> for example, if you are linking to an image file located on your hard disk in the c:\sales\images\ folder (where sales is your local root folder), and the url of your completed site is http://www.mysite.com/salesapp/ (where salesapp is your remote root folder), you should enter the url in the http address text box to ensure that the path to the linked file on the remote server is /salesapp/images/.

<s>geobulb, 
</s><s>you need to do a little research mavericks is a surfing spot near pillar point harbor in northern california.</s><s> hence the "wave" picture that's used as the default desktop wallpaper.</s><s> not only is it os x's first non-cat name, it's actually named after a german shepard named maverick.</s><s> hard to say how many place names in california are named after dogs, but it could be an interesting trend.</s><s> the name is a possessive, not a plural (several mavericks). 

</s><s>spry was a good technology in its day.</s><s> that day has come and gone, as have the days of framed pages and ap div only pages and tables as layouts.</s><s> those who refuse to move along with technology, usually only gripe about how poorly their old techniques and software perform by comparison. 
</s><s>i'm not "made of money", but i have made connections in the computing world that allow me to keep up with most of the new technologies within a short time after their release if not immediately.</s><s> i don't have funds for professional training, so i spend a lot of time (a commodity of which i have much more than money) "self teaching" and practicing to learn the latest industry practices.</s><s> it was just a few months ago i built my first "fluid grid" layout website.</s><s> the client is extremely pleased with it, and although $2500 would have had me doing that when cs6 first came out, i know what i'm doing with it now and i learned just as much as a college class or lynda.com course would have taught me. 
</s><s>mavericks has a lot of features i'm still getting used to, and i've disabled some of them because they either don't serve my needs or they're counterproductive to my work.</s><s> "spaces" is one.</s><s> i keep a second monitor for "full screen" windows in apps that work with dual screen workspaces, like dreamweaver, photoshop and audition.</s><s> spaces prevents that by putting a menu bar and dock on each display.</s><s> i've had to rewrite several keyboard shortcuts that conflict with adobe shortcuts, but i'm working thorough it.</s><s> all in all, mavericks is working pretty well for me so far...</s><s> including with adobe apps. 
</s><s>fwiw, i've never seen an os rollout that ever went 100% "glitch free", especially out of microstuff.</s><s> at least apple is batting .</s><s>900 or better instead of .</s><s>500 at best.

<s>thanks mcblob, 
</s><s>despite whatever the other reasoning is, a maverick remains what it is unbranded, wild by definition of the term. 
i use jquery and probably i am more current and trained than most.</s><s> ie undergrad in operations management, masters in it, pmp, micorsoft cert, novell cert, rdbms cert, etc...</s><s> the qualifications are present to comment.</s><s> my concern is the the application was rendered useless as it could not be configured.</s><s> this wasted my money.</s><s> i had to purchase the upgrade and never used the previous application purchased due to the inability to configure it correctly.</s><s> the reasoning was painfully apparent that a vendor specific technology was attempted without market support. 
</s><s>there are scores of case studies that point to how to implement emerging technologies.</s><s> the common practice is the build a consortium of major market stakeholders.</s><s> the more stakeholders the merrier but three major ones at a minimum to embrace the technology.</s><s> this is how standards are produced industry wide and supported.</s><s> there are scores of these consortiums from the ieee, 3wc, jquery foundation, etc... 
</s><s>this current issue appears strongly to be a lack of collaboration between apple and adobe as this seems to have caught them by surprise.</s><s> yet another common concern, collaboration, in the industry that case study after case study points towards.</s><s> even outside the industry in industries like supply chain.</s><s> collaboration up and down the chain is essential - it is fundamental to not only reducing problems but also profitability.</s><s> software applications can be considered supply chain having downstream and up stream management, cash flows, and information flows. 
i just wonder when, just when will we ever practice these things; collaboration, how to deploy emerging technologies, etc...</s><s>?</s><s> in the rush to market and profits we cost ourselves incredible amounts of money.</s><s> i don't think the opportunity costs of rushing this upgrade to market out weighed the costs accruing now... 
i appreciate adobe participating in this dialogue and not removing these posts.</s><s> whereas, apple removed the posts and sent me an email about my lack of productive comments.</s><s> there was nothing different said there than here; an attention getter then follow on discussion.</s><s> thanks!</s><s>

<s>geobulb, 
</s><s>you need to do a little research mavericks is a surfing spot near pillar point harbor in northern california.</s><s> hence the "wave" picture that's used as the default desktop wallpaper.</s><s> not only is it os x's first non-cat name, it's actually named after a german shepard named maverick.</s><s> hard to say how many place names in california are named after dogs, but it could be an interesting trend.</s><s> the name is a possessive, not a plural (several mavericks). 

</s><s>spry was a good technology in its day.</s><s> that day has come and gone, as have the days of framed pages and ap div only pages and tables as layouts.</s><s> those who refuse to move along with technology, usually only gripe about how poorly their old techniques and software perform by comparison. 
</s><s>i'm not "made of money", but i have made connections in the computing world that allow me to keep up with most of the new technologies within a short time after their release if not immediately.</s><s> i don't have funds for professional training, so i spend a lot of time (a commodity of which i have much more than money) "self teaching" and practicing to learn the latest industry practices.</s><s> it was just a few months ago i built my first "fluid grid" layout website.</s><s> the client is extremely pleased with it, and although $2500 would have had me doing that when cs6 first came out, i know what i'm doing with it now and i learned just as much as a college class or lynda.com course would have taught me. 
</s><s>mavericks has a lot of features i'm still getting used to, and i've disabled some of them because they either don't serve my needs or they're counterproductive to my work.</s><s> "spaces" is one.</s><s> i keep a second monitor for "full screen" windows in apps that work with dual screen workspaces, like dreamweaver, photoshop and audition.</s><s> spaces prevents that by putting a menu bar and dock on each display.</s><s> i've had to rewrite several keyboard shortcuts that conflict with adobe shortcuts, but i'm working thorough it.</s><s> all in all, mavericks is working pretty well for me so far...</s><s> including with adobe apps. 
</s><s>fwiw, i've never seen an os rollout that ever went 100% "glitch free", especially out of microstuff.</s><s> at least apple is batting .</s><s>900 or better instead of .</s><s>500 at best.

<s>thanks mcblob, 
</s><s>despite whatever the other reasoning is, a maverick remains what it is unbranded, wild by definition of the term. 
i use jquery and probably i am more current and trained than most.</s><s> ie undergrad in operations management, masters in it, pmp, micorsoft cert, novell cert, rdbms cert, etc...</s><s> the qualifications are present to comment.</s><s> my concern is the the application was rendered useless as it could not be configured.</s><s> this wasted my money.</s><s> i had to purchase the upgrade and never used the previous application purchased due to the inability to configure it correctly.</s><s> the reasoning was painfully apparent that a vendor specific technology was attempted without market support. 
</s><s>there are scores of case studies that point to how to implement emerging technologies.</s><s> the common practice is the build a consortium of major market stakeholders.</s><s> the more stakeholders the merrier but three major ones at a minimum to embrace the technology.</s><s> this is how standards are produced industry wide and supported.</s><s> there are scores of these consortiums from the ieee, 3wc, jquery foundation, etc... 
</s><s>this current issue appears strongly to be a lack of collaboration between apple and adobe as this seems to have caught them by surprise.</s><s> yet another common concern, collaboration, in the industry that case study after case study points towards.</s><s> even outside the industry in industries like supply chain.</s><s> collaboration up and down the chain is essential - it is fundamental to not only reducing problems but also profitability.</s><s> software applications can be considered supply chain having downstream and up stream management, cash flows, and information flows. 
i just wonder when, just when will we ever practice these things; collaboration, how to deploy emerging technologies, etc...</s><s>?</s><s> in the rush to market and profits we cost ourselves incredible amounts of money.</s><s> i don't think the opportunity costs of rushing this upgrade to market out weighed the costs accruing now... 
i appreciate adobe participating in this dialogue and not removing these posts.</s><s> whereas, apple removed the posts and sent me an email about my lack of productive comments.</s><s> there was nothing different said there than here; an attention getter then follow on discussion.</s><s> thanks!</s><s>
