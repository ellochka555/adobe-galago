<s>certainly it's inconvenient, but i wouldn't say bonkers.</s><s> i admit that i can be pretty addle-brained at times, so i might make mistakes and use features that aren't supported (especially since i don't ever seem to remember when things were added without opeing an older version to see if they are there), and unless you open the file in the previous version after backsaving you won't really see the damage. 
</s><s>keep in mind, too, that the text engine usually changes in some major or minor way (it was major between cs3 and cs4, and clearly major again for cs5 withthe addition of span/split columns) that can affect the way text is composed and is likely to affect line endings which in turn can have an impact on paragraph line counts and page ends which might cause a chapter run a page long or short and affect everything after (i saw that happen yesterday in the file i was playing with for eugene).</s><s> i'd rather know i'm looking at exactly the same thing on my screen as my client is seeing on theirs.

</s><s>there are people out there not well versed on indesign and don't know these things.

i suggested that markzware might offer an id version of markztools to open, backsave and make backwards compatible indd files like it does for quark.</s><s> so while jongware may be thinking along those same lines, markzware might be on it as we speak!

<s>for those people who don't understand why this is an issue. 
</s><s>welcome to the real world. 
</s><s>we are not all massive companies, some of us are freelancers (in fact, i'd imagine a majority of indesign userbase are freelancers).</s><s> we work with other freelancers, other design houses, tweaking, assisting, collaborating.</s><s> so now i've upgraded to cs5.5 i can no longer work in a team with those on lower versions.</s><s> no, they cannot afford to upgrade.</s><s> and no, they're not prepared to continually interrupt their work flows by some very flakey imports of idml pages - these are buggy at best.</s><s> it's a risk they don't need to take and clients are looking elsewhere/ i've invested another thousand a bit pounds and am now losing business.</s><s> many thanks adobe. 
</s><s>there is no reason why indesign files can't be saved as cs5 and cs4, if some features are incompatible, then these are lost, but seriously - what standard significant changes have happened between 5 and 5.5 - no other piece of software in existence can't save back at least one software version.</s><s> i'm now losing work because i dared to upgrade the software and cut off all team members who can't afford the upgrade.</s><s> it should be made very clear on the product pages that indesign cs5.5 cannot save native files compatible with cs5.</s><s> let's see what that does to the upgrade figures. 
</s><s>this is very, very, very bad adobe.</s><s> one question i had this morning was "do you run quark?" - and yes, i do - maybe it's time to ditch indesign, i see that the latest version of quark happily saves back two versions, also pdf export is less problematic - especially with transparency. 
</s><s>the extra features in cs5.5 are not worth losing work over.</s><s> that cs5.5 can't talk to cs5 is an example of the worst of adobe.</s><s> i'm thinking of returning the software as not fit for purpose.

</s><s>keep in mind, too, that the text engine usually changes in some major or minor way (it was major between cs3 and cs4, and clearly major again for cs5 withthe addition of span/split columns) that can affect the way text is composed and is likely to affect line endings which in turn can have an impact on paragraph line counts and page ends which might cause a chapter run a page long or short and affect everything after (i saw that happen yesterday in the file i was playing with for eugene).</s><s> i'd rather know i'm looking at exactly the same thing on my screen as my client is seeing on theirs.

<s>i mentioned this on another, but similar thread, that quark has been doing this since, when, version 4.0 (not allowing backsaving for more than one version)?</s><s> a practice quark still uses and now, from what peter or eugene said, doesn't allow older versions to be installed on the same machine!</s><s> we always use to ask for quark versions when getting files.</s><s> i used, what was it called, regedit(?</s><s>) to look at resource forks and get what version files were when clients had no idea.</s><s> a lost art! 
</s><s>but as eugene says, where does it say that when you open and save from a different version?</s><s> nowhere.</s><s> it was something we had to learn to keep our jobs. 
</s><s>now we are here in 2010, not 1993, and indesign is a far more robust and complex than we could imagine but still the same backwards saving situation.</s><s> i don't like keeping older versions of software (let alone keeping old computers around to run them) or to keep track of file formats either.</s><s> and i hate having to buy soxy, flight check and any other utility that should be built into the program to deal with this stuff, but until adobe comes up with a solution it behooves you to make it a part of your technical knowledge and doing business. 
i suggested that markzware might offer an id version of markztools to open, backsave and make backwards compatible indd files like it does for quark.</s><s> so while jongware may be thinking along those same lines, markzware might be on it as we speak!

<s>for those people who don't understand why this is an issue. 
</s><s>welcome to the real world. 
</s><s>we are not all massive companies, some of us are freelancers (in fact, i'd imagine a majority of indesign userbase are freelancers).</s><s> we work with other freelancers, other design houses, tweaking, assisting, collaborating.</s><s> so now i've upgraded to cs5.5 i can no longer work in a team with those on lower versions.</s><s> no, they cannot afford to upgrade.</s><s> and no, they're not prepared to continually interrupt their work flows by some very flakey imports of idml pages - these are buggy at best.</s><s> it's a risk they don't need to take and clients are looking elsewhere/ i've invested another thousand a bit pounds and am now losing business.</s><s> many thanks adobe. 
</s><s>there is no reason why indesign files can't be saved as cs5 and cs4, if some features are incompatible, then these are lost, but seriously - what standard significant changes have happened between 5 and 5.5 - no other piece of software in existence can't save back at least one software version.</s><s> i'm now losing work because i dared to upgrade the software and cut off all team members who can't afford the upgrade.</s><s> it should be made very clear on the product pages that indesign cs5.5 cannot save native files compatible with cs5.</s><s> let's see what that does to the upgrade figures. 
</s><s>this is very, very, very bad adobe.</s><s> one question i had this morning was "do you run quark?" - and yes, i do - maybe it's time to ditch indesign, i see that the latest version of quark happily saves back two versions, also pdf export is less problematic - especially with transparency. 
</s><s>the extra features in cs5.5 are not worth losing work over.</s><s> that cs5.5 can't talk to cs5 is an example of the worst of adobe.</s><s> i'm thinking of returning the software as not fit for purpose.

<subject>Troubleshooting 101: Replace, or "trash" your InDesign preferences</subject>
<post author="Peter Spier" timestamp="Feb 24, 2014 3:17 PM">
<s>when indesign starts to behave strangely, the number one suggestion for troubleshooting is to replace (or trash, reset or restore) the application preferences.</s><s> this will remove corrupt preferences and replace them with a new set of default preferences, and often end bad behavior. Ê there is a quick and easy method for doing this using the keyboard: close and relaunch indesign, and immediately hold down ctrl + alt + shift (windows) or cmd + ctrl + opt + shift (mac), and respond in the affirmative to the dialog asking if you really want to replace the preferences.</s><s> there are two downsides to this method, however.</s><s> first, you must be extremely fast on the keyboard (if you don't see the confirmation prompt, you were too slow), and second, anytime you replace the preferences you will lose most program customizations, and using the keyboard method leaves you with no backup to restore them when the problem turns out to be something else. Ê my preferred method is to close indesign and do a "manual" prefs replacement, which consists of finding and renaming the two files which make up the preference set: indesign defaults and indesign saveddata.</s><s> both of these files should be replaced at the same time.</s><s> you can delete them, but renaming or moving them will give you the opportunity to copy them back in the event that new prefs doesn't cure your issue.</s><s> when you restart id, the program will look for these two files, and when they are not found, a new default set will be written. Ê note: the indesign team is collecting corrupted preference files to investigate related issues.</s><s> please share your corrupted preferences files with the team here: http://adobe.ly/1jv2b7n Ê these are normally hidden files, so you will need to set your system to show them.</s><s> they will be found in various places depending on the os, and the version of indesign.</s><s> (edit: for mac users running osx 10.7 or newer, you can learn how to show hidden files here: access hidden user library files | mac os 10.7 lion) Ê indesign defaults: windows xp: c:\documents and settings\<user>\application data\adobe\indesign\<version #>\<language>\Ê (note: prior to version 6 [cs4] the language folder is not used).</s><s> windows vista or windows 7: c:\users\<user>\appdata\roaming\adobe\indesign\<version #>\<language>\ (note: prior to version 6 [cs4] the language folder is not used).</s><s> macintosh: hard drive/users/<user>/library/preferences/adobe indesign/<version #>/<language>/(note: prior to version 6 [cs4] the language folder is not used). Ê indesign saveddata: windows xp: c:\documents and settings\<user>\local settings\application data\adobe\indesign\<version #>\<language>\caches\ (note: prior to version 6 [cs4] the language folder is not used).</s><s> windows vista or windows 7: c:\users\<user>\appdata\local\adobe\indesign\<version #>\<language>\caches\Ê (note: prior to version 6 [cs4] the language folder is not used).</s><s> macintosh: hard drive/users/<user>/library/caches/adobe indesign/<version #>/<language>/ (note: prior to version 6 [cs4] the language folder is not used). Ê in some earlier versions of id, indesign saveddata may also be found in the first directory. Ê as mentioned above, when you replace your preferences you will lose customizations beyond those things that are set in the preferences dialogs.</s><s> these include document and print presets you might have created.</s><s> if you haven't made backups already, you should go, prior to replacing the preferences, to the "define" dialogs for printer and document presets and custom stroke styles, and select all of your custom entries, the click the save button and put the file someplace safe.</s><s> after resetting preferences using the keyboard or by renaming/deleting the old files and restarting indesign, these customized settings can be re-loaded with a single click once again in the define dialogs.Ê ÊÊ pdf presets can be backed up in the same way, but they are stored in a different location and will not be destroyed by a simple preference reset.</s><s> other customizations that you should not lose are workspaces, keyboard shortcut sets, and find/change queries. Ê as a further step i strongly recommend that you make a copy of these two files when you have a working customized set.</s><s> store them in a safe place and you can use them to overwrite a corrupt set so no further editing or reloading will be required.</s><s> users of indesign cs4 can use a free script from intools.com to backup and store multiple sets of preferences: in-tools scripts " preference manager script Ê edit: corrected mac path per jongware's post below. Ê update: i just ran across a situation in which overwriting the indesign defaults and indesign saveddata files failed to restore functionality to the tools on a single user account on a multiple user system (the other account was fine).</s><s> this is an absolute first and i've been using the technique for years, including replacing these two files on this system which is used by the student newspaper where i was a professor, in order to customize or restore preferences every semester.</s><s> what did work was to use the keyboard method first, then close indesign and manually replace the two files to restore the prefs to the proper settings.Ê -- peter Ê message was edited by: peter spier Ê message was edited by: peter spier Ê message was edited by: amxyz

<post author="Peter Spier" timestamp="Feb 24, 2014 3:17 PM">
<s>when indesign starts to behave strangely, the number one suggestion for troubleshooting is to replace (or trash, reset or restore) the application preferences.</s><s> this will remove corrupt preferences and replace them with a new set of default preferences, and often end bad behavior. Ê there is a quick and easy method for doing this using the keyboard: close and relaunch indesign, and immediately hold down ctrl + alt + shift (windows) or cmd + ctrl + opt + shift (mac), and respond in the affirmative to the dialog asking if you really want to replace the preferences.</s><s> there are two downsides to this method, however.</s><s> first, you must be extremely fast on the keyboard (if you don't see the confirmation prompt, you were too slow), and second, anytime you replace the preferences you will lose most program customizations, and using the keyboard method leaves you with no backup to restore them when the problem turns out to be something else. Ê my preferred method is to close indesign and do a "manual" prefs replacement, which consists of finding and renaming the two files which make up the preference set: indesign defaults and indesign saveddata.</s><s> both of these files should be replaced at the same time.</s><s> you can delete them, but renaming or moving them will give you the opportunity to copy them back in the event that new prefs doesn't cure your issue.</s><s> when you restart id, the program will look for these two files, and when they are not found, a new default set will be written. Ê note: the indesign team is collecting corrupted preference files to investigate related issues.</s><s> please share your corrupted preferences files with the team here: http://adobe.ly/1jv2b7n Ê these are normally hidden files, so you will need to set your system to show them.</s><s> they will be found in various places depending on the os, and the version of indesign.</s><s> (edit: for mac users running osx 10.7 or newer, you can learn how to show hidden files here: access hidden user library files | mac os 10.7 lion) Ê indesign defaults: windows xp: c:\documents and settings\<user>\application data\adobe\indesign\<version #>\<language>\Ê (note: prior to version 6 [cs4] the language folder is not used).</s><s> windows vista or windows 7: c:\users\<user>\appdata\roaming\adobe\indesign\<version #>\<language>\ (note: prior to version 6 [cs4] the language folder is not used).</s><s> macintosh: hard drive/users/<user>/library/preferences/adobe indesign/<version #>/<language>/(note: prior to version 6 [cs4] the language folder is not used). Ê indesign saveddata: windows xp: c:\documents and settings\<user>\local settings\application data\adobe\indesign\<version #>\<language>\caches\ (note: prior to version 6 [cs4] the language folder is not used).</s><s> windows vista or windows 7: c:\users\<user>\appdata\local\adobe\indesign\<version #>\<language>\caches\Ê (note: prior to version 6 [cs4] the language folder is not used).</s><s> macintosh: hard drive/users/<user>/library/caches/adobe indesign/<version #>/<language>/ (note: prior to version 6 [cs4] the language folder is not used). Ê in some earlier versions of id, indesign saveddata may also be found in the first directory. Ê as mentioned above, when you replace your preferences you will lose customizations beyond those things that are set in the preferences dialogs.</s><s> these include document and print presets you might have created.</s><s> if you haven't made backups already, you should go, prior to replacing the preferences, to the "define" dialogs for printer and document presets and custom stroke styles, and select all of your custom entries, the click the save button and put the file someplace safe.</s><s> after resetting preferences using the keyboard or by renaming/deleting the old files and restarting indesign, these customized settings can be re-loaded with a single click once again in the define dialogs.Ê ÊÊ pdf presets can be backed up in the same way, but they are stored in a different location and will not be destroyed by a simple preference reset.</s><s> other customizations that you should not lose are workspaces, keyboard shortcut sets, and find/change queries. Ê as a further step i strongly recommend that you make a copy of these two files when you have a working customized set.</s><s> store them in a safe place and you can use them to overwrite a corrupt set so no further editing or reloading will be required.</s><s> users of indesign cs4 can use a free script from intools.com to backup and store multiple sets of preferences: in-tools scripts " preference manager script Ê edit: corrected mac path per jongware's post below. Ê update: i just ran across a situation in which overwriting the indesign defaults and indesign saveddata files failed to restore functionality to the tools on a single user account on a multiple user system (the other account was fine).</s><s> this is an absolute first and i've been using the technique for years, including replacing these two files on this system which is used by the student newspaper where i was a professor, in order to customize or restore preferences every semester.</s><s> what did work was to use the keyboard method first, then close indesign and manually replace the two files to restore the prefs to the proper settings.Ê -- peter Ê message was edited by: peter spier Ê message was edited by: peter spier Ê message was edited by: amxyz

<subject>Troubleshooting 101: Export to .idml or .inx to clear file corruption</subject>
<post author="Peter Spier" timestamp="Apr 3, 2012 9:23 PM">
<s>sometimes a particular indesign file may behave badly (if all your files are doing strange things, see replace, or "trash" your indesign preferences ).</s><s> in such cases the first thing to try is export to .inx if you have cs, cs2 or cs3(indesign interchange format) by selecting file > export- and choosing .inx from the file type dropdown, or if you have cs5 or later export to .idml.</s><s> the resulting file should then be opened in id and saved as a new .indd file. 

</s><s>interchange format was set up to allow users to open files in a version of id one release earlier (minus, of course, new features) than the one in which they were created.</s><s> it reduces the file to the bare minimum of information needed to recreate the layout, and as a side effect it often strips out minor corruption that will cause strange behavior but is not bad enough to prevent the file from opening.</s><s> other things interchange format can help with are removal of stubborn unused swatches and references to missing plugins. 

</s><s>the .idml (indesign markup) format was introduced in cs4 and in that version you have your choice (.inx is listed as cs3 interchange) and is the replacement for .inx going forward.</s><s> my non-scientific intuition says that .idml is slighlty less effective than .inx at solving problems, so i would opt for .inx in cs4 as my first choice, but i also would not dismiss .idml out of hand if i suspect document corruption.

<s>sometimes a particular indesign file may behave badly (if all your files are doing strange things, see replace, or "trash" your indesign preferences ).</s><s> in such cases the first thing to try is export to .inx if you have cs, cs2 or cs3(indesign interchange format) by selecting file > export- and choosing .inx from the file type dropdown, or if you have cs5 or later export to .idml.</s><s> the resulting file should then be opened in id and saved as a new .indd file. 

</s><s>interchange format was set up to allow users to open files in a version of id one release earlier (minus, of course, new features) than the one in which they were created.</s><s> it reduces the file to the bare minimum of information needed to recreate the layout, and as a side effect it often strips out minor corruption that will cause strange behavior but is not bad enough to prevent the file from opening.</s><s> other things interchange format can help with are removal of stubborn unused swatches and references to missing plugins. 

</s><s>the .idml (indesign markup) format was introduced in cs4 and in that version you have your choice (.inx is listed as cs3 interchange) and is the replacement for .inx going forward.</s><s> my non-scientific intuition says that .idml is slighlty less effective than .inx at solving problems, so i would opt for .inx in cs4 as my first choice, but i also would not dismiss .idml out of hand if i suspect document corruption.

<s>if the file crashes during export, it's most likely a problem in the file (it happens).</s><s> you can try to isolate a problem page using divide and conquer: export first the font half, then the back half of the document to pdf (you can't specify a page range for .idml).</s><s> if either half fails, divide that in half again and repeat, continuing until you isolate a page.</s><s> if both halves fail, it's more likely a font or corrupt style than something on an inidvidual page.

option 2 determine how many pages in your document export or print your document in halves, i.e., if it's 200 pages then export or print page 1-100 then page 101-200 keep halving the document pages until you find the problem pages, i.e., 1-100 crashes then try 1-50 and 51-100, then 1-25 and 26-50 etc. until you've found the page(s) that are crashing 
when you've narrowed it down to a single page or multiple pages try to find out what is causing it to crash you can do this by: move half the items on the page to the pasteboard (do not delete them) and try to export again, if it crashes then move more items to the pasteboard and so on until you find the culprit(s) recreate the object(s), i.e., if a particular image is causing it to crash, then don't duplicate that frame.</s><s> you should use file>place and replace the image within the layout in a new graphic frame.</s><s> images if the file still crashes then you should resave the image as a complete new file name and different file extension, if it's psd then save as tiff or vice versa.</s><s> (note some special file formats like dcs or eps and pdf should not be opened in photoshop if they contain vector elements - if you don't know if they do or do not please do not open them in photoshop) text frames copy that text and place it in a text editor like notepad or textedit to strip all the formatting.</s><s> create a new text frame and reimport the text by using file>import or using copy and paste restyle the text to your liking
