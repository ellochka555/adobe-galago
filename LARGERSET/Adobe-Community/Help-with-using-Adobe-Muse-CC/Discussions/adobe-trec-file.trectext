<s>i think this bug is back.</s><s> i am using the latest muse build. 
</s><s>when i go to add a menu (manual) from the widget menu, i can add in the names of the buttons without issue. 
</s><s>if i want to link out to other sites, no issue. 
</s><s>however, if i add anchor links, things fall apart. 
</s><s>it seems the first few links work without issue and with a fixed menu at the top, the page scrolls nicely to the area.</s><s> however, i am noticing that the 4th and 5th button in a manual menu do not respond to active states and even the scrolling page navigation is wonky.</s><s> the "team" and "contact" buttons never highlight, even when selected, nor do they navigate properly to the corresponidng anchor link. 
i have moved the anchor links deeper down the page to see if this makes a difference and it doesn't.</s><s> it is as if the menu can't pick up the anchor points.

<s>multiplydesign - 
i am able to see how sometimes no link shows as active.</s><s> this is a separate bug because active anchors are working when you scroll the page and for your first three links.</s><s> this looks like another active anchor bug we're working on fixing where the clicking the links goes to an anchor that is half a pixel or so lower than the link.</s><s> in this case scrolling just a little shows the active state, and you can only get into this by clicking the link.

<s>i think this bug is back.</s><s> i am using the latest muse build. 
</s><s>when i go to add a menu (manual) from the widget menu, i can add in the names of the buttons without issue. 
</s><s>if i want to link out to other sites, no issue. 
</s><s>however, if i add anchor links, things fall apart. 
</s><s>it seems the first few links work without issue and with a fixed menu at the top, the page scrolls nicely to the area.</s><s> however, i am noticing that the 4th and 5th button in a manual menu do not respond to active states and even the scrolling page navigation is wonky.</s><s> the "team" and "contact" buttons never highlight, even when selected, nor do they navigate properly to the corresponidng anchor link. 
i have moved the anchor links deeper down the page to see if this makes a difference and it doesn't.</s><s> it is as if the menu can't pick up the anchor points. 
i addition, when viewed on ios devices (although not optimized) i get 2 active states selected in the menu. 
i think the script for this widget needs revisiting.</s><s> please advise. 
</s><s>here is a link to my temporary example: 
http://jbrubaker.fatcow.com/warwick/index.html 
the active state only shows up for the first 3 buttons...weird.

<s>hi darren 
</s><s>in muse when you click on add web fonts , you can add typekit fonts which would be added in your fonts list and then use for text.</s><s> if you want to use a typekit font which is not included in the list but you have purchase or added from typekit end, then there is a workaround to use that in muse.</s><s> basically you would need to create a paragraph style using the typekit font and then apply that paragraph style to texts that you have used on page.

<subject>Add files to custom widget</subject>
<post author="Pallie" timestamp="Mar 17, 2014 9:12 AM">
<s>hello, 
</s><s>i have created a .mucow widget that adds some css to the head, html to the body and a script at the bottom.</s><s> currently the .css and .js are working, because i have added the files to "add files to upload" and in the code they're linked to the assets/ directory.

<subject>New features in Adobe Muse 2.0</subject>
<post author="Corey@Adobe" timestamp="Nov 15, 2013 3:37 PM">
<s>the following is a list of features now available in adobe muse: 
align palette we've added a new align palette, available from the window menu, or by clicking on the new 'align' control in the control strip.</s><s> you can use the new align features to align or distribute selected objects relative to each other, or to the page content area (which is the area from the bottom of the header to the top of the footer). 
</s><s>asset upload you can now link to any external file (i.e.</s><s> pdf, .zip file, .dmg or .exe) and add a hyperlink to it to enable users to download the file from your web site.</s><s> all linked assets will be uploaded / exported along with the rest of the adobe muse site, in a new 'assets' folder. 
</s><s>code generation improvements we've improved the html code generation for adobe muse 2.0 in several areas.</s><s> shadows, glows, and gradients now use css instead of generating additional images.</s><s> we've eliminated many cases where we generated duplicated html nodes.</s><s> we've also changed our javascript framework for our widgets from spry to a smaller, faster framework called webpro.</s><s> these changes make the export process faster, and adobe muse now generates less images and smaller html files.</s><s> shadows and outer glows are represented using css box-shadows instead of rasterizing.</s><s> fixed the naming of images exported by adobe muse which have been either resampled or cropped before exporting.</s><s> background images that have been set to "scale to fit" or "scale to fill" are now exported with the 'contain' or 'cover' background-size css property, respectively.</s><s> browsers display a warning when you serve a page that mixes http and https content, which can be triggered if loading content from a content delivery network (cdn) such as amazon's cloudfront.</s><s> to avoid these warnings, adobe muse uses some javascript to not use cdn urls with https in favor of falling back to a local version of the content. 
</s><s>forms we've added a new form widget to the widget library.</s><s> you can easily configure the form to send the form submissions to multiple email addresses, and optionally redirect users to another page after submitting the form.</s><s> you can add and remove fields, and style the form as you would other adobe muse elements.</s><s> you can independently style the various states of the form, and form fields to provide a compelling user experience, with visual cues for error states, empty states, and more.</s><s> because form processing requires server-side support, adobe muse forms are configured to work when published to adobe business catalyst.</s><s> if you make changes to your form and publish again, adobe muse will make the appropriate changes to your adobe business catalyst forms.</s><s> adobe muse will safeguard data when redesigning your adobe business catalyst forms if a field with no data submitted is removed, it will be deleted from the database.</s><s> if a field that has submitted data is removed, it will be preserved in the database, but can be deleted from the adobe business catalyst admin console if desired.</s><s> font improvements the font ui includes font previews in the form of sample text rendered in the corresponding font/weight/style.</s><s> submenus for the various font types (web, web-safe and system) have been eliminated in favor of a single sectioned list, with shortcuts to scroll to each section.</s><s> web fonts and system fonts are grouped by font family; individual weights and styles (e.g.</s><s> bold, italic, bold italic etc.</s><s>) of multi-face font families appear in sub-menus.</s><s> the font ui displays an automatically generated list of recently used fonts.</s><s> the number of recently used fonts to display can be configured and list can be cleared.</s><s> the font list can be filtered by font family (e.g.</s><s> "myriad pro"), weight or style (e.g.</s><s> "bold italic"), a combination of these (e.g., "myriad pro bold italic"), including partial names in any order (e.g., "it bold myr pro").</s><s> adobe muse now uses platform-independent references to fonts, so adobe muse documents can be exchanged between mac and windows without failure to resolve font references.</s><s> adobe muse displays localized font names (if available) based on the application locale, rather than system locale.</s><s> adobe muse documents can be exchanged between across application locales without failure to resolve font references. 
</s><s>ftp upload adobe muse now includes the ability to ftp to the host of your choice by selecting file > upload to ftp host in the adobe muse menu.</s><s> adobe muse's ftp upload dialog allows you to specify the host, subdirectory, and login information. 
</s><s>adobe edge integration if you publish an .oam file from adobe edge, you can place it into adobe muse.</s><s> all required images, css and javascript content will be uploaded at publish or export time.</s><s> as with other placed content any changes made in the source adobe edge file and re-saved in .oam format will be detected within adobe muse, and you can use the assets palette to update the content in adobe muse. 
</s><s>language support japanese and italian localizations have been added.</s><s> specific japanese features include the addition of japanese web safe fonts on the font menu as well as support for japanese ime, including text input and double-byte text. 
</s><s>ruler guides adobe muse now includes the ability to drag guides onto a page from the horizontal or vertical ruler.</s><s> page items snap to guides when moving, but guides are not exported.</s><s> adobe muse supports selecting multiple guides on a page. 
</s><s>sitemap.xml adobe muse now creates a sitemap.xml file for better search engine optimization when the site is hosted somewhere other than adobe business catalyst.</s><s> you can exclude a page from the sitemap.xml file (if you don't want search engines to find it) by setting an option in the page properties dialog. 
</s><s>browser fill improvements you can now set a gradient on the browser fill.</s><s> (note: opacity, focal point and size are not available due to cross-browser compatibility and usability standards) in addition, you can now set your browser background image to fit or to fill. 
</s><s>control strip improvements the adobe muse control strip now has collapsible control sets (similar to illustrator).</s><s> as you expand the width of the adobe muse application window more controls appear.</s><s> additional controls have been added to the control strip Ð states, transform, and align.</s><s> text controls are now available when text frames are selected, not just when you're using the text tool.

<post author="Corey@Adobe" timestamp="Nov 15, 2013 3:37 PM">
<s>the following is a list of features now available in adobe muse: 
align palette we've added a new align palette, available from the window menu, or by clicking on the new 'align' control in the control strip.</s><s> you can use the new align features to align or distribute selected objects relative to each other, or to the page content area (which is the area from the bottom of the header to the top of the footer). 
</s><s>asset upload you can now link to any external file (i.e.</s><s> pdf, .zip file, .dmg or .exe) and add a hyperlink to it to enable users to download the file from your web site.</s><s> all linked assets will be uploaded / exported along with the rest of the adobe muse site, in a new 'assets' folder. 
</s><s>code generation improvements we've improved the html code generation for adobe muse 2.0 in several areas.</s><s> shadows, glows, and gradients now use css instead of generating additional images.</s><s> we've eliminated many cases where we generated duplicated html nodes.</s><s> we've also changed our javascript framework for our widgets from spry to a smaller, faster framework called webpro.</s><s> these changes make the export process faster, and adobe muse now generates less images and smaller html files.</s><s> shadows and outer glows are represented using css box-shadows instead of rasterizing.</s><s> fixed the naming of images exported by adobe muse which have been either resampled or cropped before exporting.</s><s> background images that have been set to "scale to fit" or "scale to fill" are now exported with the 'contain' or 'cover' background-size css property, respectively.</s><s> browsers display a warning when you serve a page that mixes http and https content, which can be triggered if loading content from a content delivery network (cdn) such as amazon's cloudfront.</s><s> to avoid these warnings, adobe muse uses some javascript to not use cdn urls with https in favor of falling back to a local version of the content. 
</s><s>forms we've added a new form widget to the widget library.</s><s> you can easily configure the form to send the form submissions to multiple email addresses, and optionally redirect users to another page after submitting the form.</s><s> you can add and remove fields, and style the form as you would other adobe muse elements.</s><s> you can independently style the various states of the form, and form fields to provide a compelling user experience, with visual cues for error states, empty states, and more.</s><s> because form processing requires server-side support, adobe muse forms are configured to work when published to adobe business catalyst.</s><s> if you make changes to your form and publish again, adobe muse will make the appropriate changes to your adobe business catalyst forms.</s><s> adobe muse will safeguard data when redesigning your adobe business catalyst forms if a field with no data submitted is removed, it will be deleted from the database.</s><s> if a field that has submitted data is removed, it will be preserved in the database, but can be deleted from the adobe business catalyst admin console if desired.</s><s> font improvements the font ui includes font previews in the form of sample text rendered in the corresponding font/weight/style.</s><s> submenus for the various font types (web, web-safe and system) have been eliminated in favor of a single sectioned list, with shortcuts to scroll to each section.</s><s> web fonts and system fonts are grouped by font family; individual weights and styles (e.g.</s><s> bold, italic, bold italic etc.</s><s>) of multi-face font families appear in sub-menus.</s><s> the font ui displays an automatically generated list of recently used fonts.</s><s> the number of recently used fonts to display can be configured and list can be cleared.</s><s> the font list can be filtered by font family (e.g.</s><s> "myriad pro"), weight or style (e.g.</s><s> "bold italic"), a combination of these (e.g., "myriad pro bold italic"), including partial names in any order (e.g., "it bold myr pro").</s><s> adobe muse now uses platform-independent references to fonts, so adobe muse documents can be exchanged between mac and windows without failure to resolve font references.</s><s> adobe muse displays localized font names (if available) based on the application locale, rather than system locale.</s><s> adobe muse documents can be exchanged between across application locales without failure to resolve font references. 
</s><s>ftp upload adobe muse now includes the ability to ftp to the host of your choice by selecting file > upload to ftp host in the adobe muse menu.</s><s> adobe muse's ftp upload dialog allows you to specify the host, subdirectory, and login information. 
</s><s>adobe edge integration if you publish an .oam file from adobe edge, you can place it into adobe muse.</s><s> all required images, css and javascript content will be uploaded at publish or export time.</s><s> as with other placed content any changes made in the source adobe edge file and re-saved in .oam format will be detected within adobe muse, and you can use the assets palette to update the content in adobe muse. 
</s><s>language support japanese and italian localizations have been added.</s><s> specific japanese features include the addition of japanese web safe fonts on the font menu as well as support for japanese ime, including text input and double-byte text. 
</s><s>ruler guides adobe muse now includes the ability to drag guides onto a page from the horizontal or vertical ruler.</s><s> page items snap to guides when moving, but guides are not exported.</s><s> adobe muse supports selecting multiple guides on a page. 
</s><s>sitemap.xml adobe muse now creates a sitemap.xml file for better search engine optimization when the site is hosted somewhere other than adobe business catalyst.</s><s> you can exclude a page from the sitemap.xml file (if you don't want search engines to find it) by setting an option in the page properties dialog. 
</s><s>browser fill improvements you can now set a gradient on the browser fill.</s><s> (note: opacity, focal point and size are not available due to cross-browser compatibility and usability standards) in addition, you can now set your browser background image to fit or to fill. 
</s><s>control strip improvements the adobe muse control strip now has collapsible control sets (similar to illustrator).</s><s> as you expand the width of the adobe muse application window more controls appear.</s><s> additional controls have been added to the control strip Ð states, transform, and align.</s><s> text controls are now available when text frames are selected, not just when you're using the text tool.

<s>hi there. Ê so the solution for this requires two things.</s><s> well actually you could do it in your os's build in explorer and the text editor of choise, but that would take ages to complete. Ê so how do we quicken up the process, and what do i actually want you to do here.</s><s> well... Ê .html files can be converted into .php files with no loose whatsoever.</s><s> the reason it breaks a site created in adobe muse is because the code generated by muse refers to .html files and not .php files.</s><s> so you need to rename all your .html files to .php and you need to do the exact same within your documents. Ê what you'll need is: a program that can rename multible file at once, and another to find and replace within multible files i used these adobe bride dreamweaver Ê here is a guide for you to convert your site adobe muse site into a fully functional php site. Ê +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +ÊÊÊÊ remember to backup your websiteÊ + +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Ê first we rename the file extentions... Ê 1.</s><s> open adobe bridge.</s><s> 1. within bridge navigate and select all the folders and files that was created when you exported your muse website as html.</s><s> 2. now go to tools>batch rename.</s><s> 3. in the window that opens find new filenames.</s><s> 4. set option one to string substitution and option two to original filename.</s><s> 5. in the find: test field enter .html and in the replace with: text field enter .php make sure 'replace all' is cheched. Ê now all your html files has been converted into fully functional php files, that could be integrated into wordpress.</s><s> but your site is currently broken, cause all the links on your website still looks for html files. Ê to get around this you'll need a program that can find and replace on multible files.</s><s> i used adobe dreamweaver.</s><s> and this is how it's done in dreamweaver. Ê 1.</s><s> open dreamweaver.</s><s> 2. edit > find and replace...</s><s> 3. in the window change find in: to folder...</s><s> 4. select the folder where your muse website is stored.</s><s> 5. in the find: field enter .html in the replace: field enter .php 6. press replace all. Ê all done.</s><s> your website is now a fully functional php site, that can run php code.</s><s> you will now be able to integrate wordpress into your website.</s><s> see: http://codex.wordpress.org/integrating_wordpress_with_your_website Ê jacob

<s>i am currently working on a solution for exactly this problem.</s><s> i have a wamp testing server, and i am using a skeletal wordpress theme (http://themble.com/bones/) as my "framework".</s><s> i built the entire site using this flow: photoshop > adobe animate > muse [this makes up the basic, functional html site] - i then created a new dreamweaver site and assembled copies of all of my files there for work.</s><s> once i had the site functioning on my wamp server, i pulled the muse files apart using notepad++ into header/page/footer sections.</s><s> previously in muse, i marked areas for these things using the "insert html" function.</s><s> i was able to easily assemble the html site pages in wordpress by using template pages.</s><s> here is an example of how i structured the pages: 
html site: wordpress site: index.html >> [header-home.php] + [page-home.php] + [footer-home.php] contact.html >> [header-contact.php] + [page-contact.php] + [footer-contact.php] 
and so forth.</s><s> it is a little extra work but once you learn to "tag" sections as you create in muse and then reassemble in dreamweaver and notepad++ it works just fine.</s><s> if you do it correctly, you get the full benefit of wordpress and all its functions but retain the exact look and feel of your site as you designed it.</s><s> the site is currently on my testing server while i check stability and platforms, but once i have it working i will post a link for everyone to look at.

<s>additional tip on this process - if you have headers and footers that are the same across multiple pages, you can create header-common.php and footer-common.php files which will speed up your work process in wordpress.</s><s> make sure you tag the "get_header( )" and "get_footer( )" function calls correctly for each page-[name].php, or wordpress will just call its fallback "header.php" or "footer.php".</s><s> be sure to check that all your scripts for any given page are in the correct places (which is why i like to create individual headers and footers).

<s>hi there. Ê so the solution for this requires two things.</s><s> well actually you could do it in your os's build in explorer and the text editor of choise, but that would take ages to complete. Ê so how do we quicken up the process, and what do i actually want you to do here.</s><s> well... Ê .html files can be converted into .php files with no loose whatsoever.</s><s> the reason it breaks a site created in adobe muse is because the code generated by muse refers to .html files and not .php files.</s><s> so you need to rename all your .html files to .php and you need to do the exact same within your documents. Ê what you'll need is: a program that can rename multible file at once, and another to find and replace within multible files i used these adobe bride dreamweaver Ê here is a guide for you to convert your site adobe muse site into a fully functional php site. Ê +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +ÊÊÊÊ remember to backup your websiteÊ + +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Ê first we rename the file extentions... Ê 1.</s><s> open adobe bridge.</s><s> 1. within bridge navigate and select all the folders and files that was created when you exported your muse website as html.</s><s> 2. now go to tools>batch rename.</s><s> 3. in the window that opens find new filenames.</s><s> 4. set option one to string substitution and option two to original filename.</s><s> 5. in the find: test field enter .html and in the replace with: text field enter .php make sure 'replace all' is cheched. Ê now all your html files has been converted into fully functional php files, that could be integrated into wordpress.</s><s> but your site is currently broken, cause all the links on your website still looks for html files. Ê to get around this you'll need a program that can find and replace on multible files.</s><s> i used adobe dreamweaver.</s><s> and this is how it's done in dreamweaver. Ê 1.</s><s> open dreamweaver.</s><s> 2. edit > find and replace...</s><s> 3. in the window change find in: to folder...</s><s> 4. select the folder where your muse website is stored.</s><s> 5. in the find: field enter .html in the replace: field enter .php 6. press replace all. Ê all done.</s><s> your website is now a fully functional php site, that can run php code.</s><s> you will now be able to integrate wordpress into your website.</s><s> see: http://codex.wordpress.org/integrating_wordpress_with_your_website Ê jacob

and so forth.</s><s> it is a little extra work but once you learn to "tag" sections as you create in muse and then reassemble in dreamweaver and notepad++ it works just fine.</s><s> if you do it correctly, you get the full benefit of wordpress and all its functions but retain the exact look and feel of your site as you designed it.</s><s> the site is currently on my testing server while i check stability and platforms, but once i have it working i will post a link for everyone to look at.

<s>additional tip on this process - if you have headers and footers that are the same across multiple pages, you can create header-common.php and footer-common.php files which will speed up your work process in wordpress.</s><s> make sure you tag the "get_header( )" and "get_footer( )" function calls correctly for each page-[name].php, or wordpress will just call its fallback "header.php" or "footer.php".</s><s> be sure to check that all your scripts for any given page are in the correct places (which is why i like to create individual headers and footers).

<s>muse does not implement "responsive layout" as defined by a hand coder (which means using one html file and one set of images for multiple layout variations that are driven from multiple css definitions usually triggered by media queries). 
</s><s>however, muse does provide a few features for creating a web page design that responds to some degree to resizing of the browser window: 1) browser fill images set to scale to fill or scale to fit (generally with the page fill and stroke set to none, so the browser fill is the background everywhere) 2) 100% browser width objects (which can contain background images set to scale to fill, scale to fit, center, etc. and which can include text frames) 3) pinned items, which maintain a specific location offset from one or two edges of the browser window 
you may want to look through the sites at the muse site-of-the-day to get a feel for the spectrum of webpage designs muse is capable of.

<s>dj, first, technically speaking the lastest version of muse is "responsive".</s><s> you can create three different layouts for desktop, tablet and cell phone.</s><s> it does not implement this support in the industry best practices, but i don't know of any plans in the works to offer anything further than this.</s><s> but as we have discussed above muse is not the tool for a web developer.</s><s> it is a tool for individuals to build microsites or vanity sites.</s><s> simple, small sites for specific purposes. 
</s><s>if you are truly building many sites and want then truly responsive, muse isn't the product you want.</s><s> you should use dreamweaver or something else.</s><s> i like specific features and functions in muse, but i can't use it for most of my work because i can't read/edit the code it makes.</s><s> it was not intended for that purpose.</s><s> it's good for what it does.</s><s> my toolbox has many tools in it.</s><s> not one of those tools does every job i need to do.</s><s> but i use each one for its best purpose.</s><s> when a product tries to do everything, it usually doesn't do any of them very well.</s><s> i'm sure muse will get more and more functionality, but i doubt if it will ever replace dreamweaver and dreamweaver will probably never be able to do all the things muse does.</s><s> i'll keep them both in my toolbox.

<s>muse does not implement "responsive layout" as defined by a hand coder (which means using one html file and one set of images for multiple layout variations that are driven from multiple css definitions usually triggered by media queries). 
</s><s>however, muse does provide a few features for creating a web page design that responds to some degree to resizing of the browser window: 1) browser fill images set to scale to fill or scale to fit (generally with the page fill and stroke set to none, so the browser fill is the background everywhere) 2) 100% browser width objects (which can contain background images set to scale to fill, scale to fit, center, etc. and which can include text frames) 3) pinned items, which maintain a specific location offset from one or two edges of the browser window 
you may want to look through the sites at the muse site-of-the-day to get a feel for the spectrum of webpage designs muse is capable of.

<s>yes, muse would not be that product.</s><s> reflow isn't a finished product yet, so that's not a factor.</s><s> you'll just have to wait for it to be finalized. 
</s><s>you can always use dreamweaver or edge code if you want to create html that you need to hand off.</s><s> dw is especially helpful because it is very extensible and has a long history with many users.</s><s> it provides visual design capabilities and the latest version has some advanced css trouble-shooting tools.

<s>adobe.</s><s> listen up.</s><s> while i respect you folks immensely (i really mean that) i'm really dissapointed that when i needed responsive tools you don't have a product ready and waiting for me.</s><s> i love muse, i host many sites with it but i am going to complely change direction and move to tools like webflow like tonight if you don't announce an upcoming muse responsive design offering. 
i do not want to do this.</s><s> i am paying for the creative cloud and took time learning muse and like how it functions.</s><s> however, responsive design isn't a luxury it's a need. 
</s><s>please fix this, you have about 24 hours before i bounce as a customer and i'm never going to come back, because i'm going to have lockin in with some other tool.</s><s> announce a project to get it done in 30 days and i'm in.</s><s> be 15 days late delivering, i'll forgive you... but show some sign that you understand this is serious. 
i also know you are too big to care about 1 customer but i assure you all your other customers are thinking about it.</s><s> we are design people and we are getting our ***** handed to us with amazing responsive sites with vector based css that renderers faster (so retains users better). 
</s><s>as a company adobe no longer benefits finacially from diving your various offerings.</s><s> please give me one tool that can just handle this please please please!</s><s>!</s><s>

<post author="JMaivald" timestamp="Mar 12, 2014 7:18 AM">
<s>dj, first, technically speaking the lastest version of muse is "responsive".</s><s> you can create three different layouts for desktop, tablet and cell phone.</s><s> it does not implement this support in the industry best practices, but i don't know of any plans in the works to offer anything further than this.</s><s> but as we have discussed above muse is not the tool for a web developer.</s><s> it is a tool for individuals to build microsites or vanity sites.</s><s> simple, small sites for specific purposes. 
</s><s>if you are truly building many sites and want then truly responsive, muse isn't the product you want.</s><s> you should use dreamweaver or something else.</s><s> i like specific features and functions in muse, but i can't use it for most of my work because i can't read/edit the code it makes.</s><s> it was not intended for that purpose.</s><s> it's good for what it does.</s><s> my toolbox has many tools in it.</s><s> not one of those tools does every job i need to do.</s><s> but i use each one for its best purpose.</s><s> when a product tries to do everything, it usually doesn't do any of them very well.</s><s> i'm sure muse will get more and more functionality, but i doubt if it will ever replace dreamweaver and dreamweaver will probably never be able to do all the things muse does.</s><s> i'll keep them both in my toolbox. 
</s><s>hope that helps.

<post author="Franck Payen" timestamp="May 15, 2013 11:19 PM">
<s>ok, on another discussion about rotating full screen backgrounds slideshows, i was orientated to try a small lib named "backstrech" 
i throw myself in, and i really like what we can do with it. 
</s><s>to use it simply, just make an html object and paste this in : 
<script src="http://musecdn2.businesscatalyst.com/scripts/4.0/jquery-1.8.3.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="assets/jquery.backstretch.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

<script>
  $.backstretch([
</s><s>      "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/515046/www/outside.jpg"
    , "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/515046/www/garfield-interior.jpg"
    , "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/515046/www/cheers.jpg"
  ], {duration: 3000, fade: 750});
</script> 

then add the jquery.backstretch.min.js to your "downloaded files" (file menu > files to download) 
</s><s>and you're done. 
</s><s>now, i need some help from better developers. 
</s><s>as you can see, my first line is a call to jquery, the same that we find later in muse exported code. 
</s><s>reason 1 : without this line, jquery is not defined and the plugin won't work. 
</s><s>this raises 2 issues : - we load twice the same ressource which is useless (100k) - loading js is all about having the page hangs while it loads, hence, they are put at the end of the body. 
</s><s>does anybody know a way to load this particular html script after we are sure the muse scripts (esp. jquery) have been loaded ? 
(in the edge animate world, i'd go for the yepnope, and put it at the right place in the code, though, here i have no access to page load structure except head) 

ps : in addition to that, i made an exported page/excluded from navigation where i put all the images i wanted for the background, i could then simply change the images lines : , "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/515046/www/garfield-interior.jpg" to , "images/my_image_name_as_in_ressources.jpg"

<s>ok, on another discussion about rotating full screen backgrounds slideshows, i was orientated to try a small lib named "backstrech" 
i throw myself in, and i really like what we can do with it. 
</s><s>to use it simply, just make an html object and paste this in : 
<script src="http://musecdn2.businesscatalyst.com/scripts/4.0/jquery-1.8.3.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="assets/jquery.backstretch.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

<script>
  $.backstretch([
</s><s>      "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/515046/www/outside.jpg"
    , "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/515046/www/garfield-interior.jpg"
    , "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/515046/www/cheers.jpg"
  ], {duration: 3000, fade: 750});
</script> 

then add the jquery.backstretch.min.js to your "downloaded files" (file menu > files to download) 
</s><s>and you're done. 
</s><s>now, i need some help from better developers. 
</s><s>as you can see, my first line is a call to jquery, the same that we find later in muse exported code. 
</s><s>reason 1 : without this line, jquery is not defined and the plugin won't work. 
</s><s>this raises 2 issues : - we load twice the same ressource which is useless (100k) - loading js is all about having the page hangs while it loads, hence, they are put at the end of the body. 
</s><s>does anybody know a way to load this particular html script after we are sure the muse scripts (esp. jquery) have been loaded ? 
(in the edge animate world, i'd go for the yepnope, and put it at the right place in the code, though, here i have no access to page load structure except head) 

ps : in addition to that, i made an exported page/excluded from navigation where i put all the images i wanted for the background, i could then simply change the images lines : , "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/515046/www/garfield-interior.jpg" to , "images/my_image_name_as_in_ressources.jpg"

<s>i'm looking to create something similar to the page below.</s><s> up and down arrow buttons ( much like the slideshow arrows and obviously pinned to one place) that when clicked can move up or down to multiple sections within a single page like the home page for example.</s><s> i'm assuming this would have to do with anchors (or maybe html code) and "arrow" buttons however anchors only take you to one section at a time.</s><s> if i could get some advice i would greatly appreciate it!

<s>the primary cause of blurring images is the less than photoshop-quality image downsampling algorithm currently used in muse (that was compounded in early betas due to a bug in the jpeg compression library we were using at that time).</s><s> due to work we've done for beta 7 to improve image encoding performance we now have the infrastructure in place to enable us to take a much better image resampler/resizer (after beta 7), so this source of blurring will be addressed. 
</s><s>the other source of blurring is unique to opaque images containing line art or otherwise containing hard edges and large areas of solid color.</s><s> when an image is opaque muse will encode it as jpeg (if it's altered in muse is a way that requires re-encoding).</s><s> for line art this will introduce jpeg compression artifacts that can be noticeable depending on your eye and the specific image involved. 
</s><s>there are (at least) to ways to avoid these jpeg compression artifacts: resize your image before placing and avoid applying any effects (rounded corners, drop shadow, etc.</s><s>) or doing any cropping or resizing in muse.</s><s> if the image is unaltered your original jpeg, png or gif will be passed through unaltered.* put at least one pixel of transparency in your original image.</s><s> (it could be a single 99% opaque pixel.</s><s>) this will force muse to encode as png.</s><s> png compression is lossless and thus doesn't introduce any compression artifacts.</s><s> however, an average png can be 5 times the size of a jpeg for the same image, so there is an impact to webpage download performance. 
*for psd files muse has to encode the original psd data into some web-friendly image format.</s><s> if an image is resized in photoshop and placed muse won't resize/resample the image data, but it will encode it as jpeg or png depending on whether it contains transparency.
