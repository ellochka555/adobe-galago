<s>i think it would be great if pp didn't require media cache files to do what it does, but...for now they're a necessity.</s><s> the problem is that occasionally those cache files go wonky and they need to be deleted so that pp can rebuild them.</s><s> and that's where things get tricky. 
</s><s>it's probably not a bad thing to completely delete the contents of both the media cache files and the media cache folders every now and then, if for no other reason than to clean up space on the hard drive.</s><s> those files do tend to build up.</s><s> but when you have a problem and need to delete only the files for a specific project, things are not quite as easy.</s><s> if you work with avchd or other dslr media, you often end up with a multitude of clips labeled identically (00001, 00002, etc.</s><s>) with no way to know which clip belongs to which project.</s><s> and even when you do work with uniquely named media, the files names are often random and locating which clips belong to which project would be a major pita. 
</s><s>we could set the location for those files to project specific folders manually.</s><s> this would make finding the project's cache files easy, but then every time we changed projects, we'd have to go in and change those settings.</s><s> that, too, is an unworkable option. 
</s><s>so here's the proposal.</s><s> premiere pro would create a project folder for each project's cache files, like it does with preview folders.</s><s> if you set your preview folder to a single location for every project, you will notice that pp automatically generates project folders within that single location.</s><s> this makes it very easy to locate and delete a specific project's previews.</s><s> i suggest the same for the cache files, thus making equally as easy to delete only the cache files for the project we're having trouble with, and not requiring every project to rebuild its cache, only the problem project.

here's the request i ended up with, if anyone cares to copy/paste: 
https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/mmform/index.cfm?name=wishform 
*******enhancement / fmr********* 
project specific cache 
i'd like to get the option to store cache files in project specific folders, much like preview files.</s><s> possibly via the addition of a checkbox under the current "save media cache files next to originals..." 
</s><s>why is this feature important to you?</s><s> cache files often need rebuilding.</s><s> right now there's no way to delete only the problem files.</s><s> we have to delete them all, which means even those that aren't a problem will need rebuilding when we reopen those projects.</s><s> this is wasted time waiting.

<s>i see your point.</s><s> i normally use media in only one project, but i can see the difficulty where media is used across multiple projects. 
</s><s>well, there are two possible solutions i can see here.</s><s> the first is to duplicate the cache files.</s><s> this keeps things organized on the hard drive making it very easy to delete only those files for a specific project, either because you're done and want to clean house, or because there's an issue and you need to rebuild them.</s><s> the advantage here is very easy file management outside of pp. the disadvantage is potential increased usage on the hard drive.</s><s> (given the affordability of storage these days, this is not a bad option.</s><s>) 
</s><s>the second option is as you suggested in post 12, sort of a turbo-charged version of the clean button that we have now.</s><s> the advantage is potentially less usage on the hard drive.</s><s> the disadvantage is the project needs to be open in order to clean house, you can't do it manually with a file manager, which is normally my preference for this sort of thing.</s><s> (i'm of the mind that any nle should be able to read a file, or create a new file, but should have zero ability to rename, move or delete any files on the hard drive.</s><s> that kind of thing should always be done outside the nle with a proper file manager.</s><s>) 
</s><s>so we have two options to make life easier when cache files need rebuilding.</s><s> i'd love to hear from others which they prefer. 
1.</s><s> project specific cache folders.</s><s> (easy file management, but potential for duplicate cache files on the hard drive.</s><s>)

</s><s>it's probably not a bad thing to completely delete the contents of both the media cache files and the media cache folders every now and then, if for no other reason than to clean up space on the hard drive.</s><s> those files do tend to build up.</s><s> but when you have a problem and need to delete only the files for a specific project, things are not quite as easy.</s><s> if you work with avchd or other dslr media, you often end up with a multitude of clips labeled identically (00001, 00002, etc.</s><s>) with no way to know which clip belongs to which project.</s><s> and even when you do work with uniquely named media, the files names are often random and locating which clips belong to which project would be a major pita. 
</s><s>we could set the location for those files to project specific folders manually.</s><s> this would make finding the project's cache files easy, but then every time we changed projects, we'd have to go in and change those settings.</s><s> that, too, is an unworkable option. 
</s><s>so here's the proposal.</s><s> premiere pro would create a project folder for each project's cache files, like it does with preview folders.</s><s> if you set your preview folder to a single location for every project, you will notice that pp automatically generates project folders within that single location.</s><s> this makes it very easy to locate and delete a specific project's previews.</s><s> i suggest the same for the cache files, thus making equally as easy to delete only the cache files for the project we're having trouble with, and not requiring every project to rebuild its cache, only the problem project.

<s>i see your point.</s><s> i normally use media in only one project, but i can see the difficulty where media is used across multiple projects.

<s>this problem has stopped me from making any further progress.</s><s> i removed the track that was replacing others from the project, and then another clip substituted for other clips. then i tried a couple more new projects with different subjects and from different folders and the same thing is happening.</s><s> the last time i tried a different approach.</s><s> instead of dragging all the clips at once to the new sequence folder or timeline, after importing them all i added one, then trimmed, the next and so on, and the 4th one is playing the same sequence as the 3rd.</s><s> actually before finishing this post i came back to check for more details as the 3rd is much shorter than the 4th and i wanted to see relay what happened with the extra time. but when i returned, now the 3rd sequence is playing part of the 4th, just the reverse.

<s>how do you handle the files and importing into premiere?</s><s> very important to not modify the original folder structure as it came from sd card, copy entire contents to hard drive, then in premiere use the "media browser" for import.</s><s> there is metadata and such in that folder structure, and i'm wondering if perhaps you were picking and choosing the video clips and moving them to the different bird folders?</s><s> premiere tends to get confused sometimes when it's done that way.

<s>jeff and i had the same thought.</s><s> unless you shoot only one species of bird at a time, and only male or female of that species, then you're likely moving things around on the hard drive to organize them, and that may be the cause here.

<s>i have accumlated more than a thosand video clips and made some movies before, but am only now starting to do it more intensely. 
</s><s>my procedure has always been thus: download the card to a new day folder.</s><s> rough edit and delete obvious junk.</s><s> re-edit more carefully once or twice and maybe rate the videos as well as the stills from the card.</s><s> after this i add data, such as description, locality, date etc. then i renumber all contents according to my numbering system.</s><s> then i move all subjects to species folders that are arranged in a phylogenetic tree. 
</s><s>this problem only popped up a few days ago.</s><s> just before that i made some other video with about the same number of clips without the problem and posted some to youtube, eg: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bncsjygwnbc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydw_6scynei 
an older one of different clips https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnefl5xb0ow 
so the problem doesn't seem related to thsi way i have always done things and only started a couple of days ago, coincidentally though after i added mcafee to my computer.

'mercury playback engine' is a name for a large number of performance improvements in premiere pro cs5.</s><s> those improvements include the following: - 64-bit application - multithreaded application - processing of some things using cuda everyone who has premiere pro cs5 has the first two of these.</s><s> only the third one depends on having a specific graphics card.</s><s> confusingly---because of one of our own early videos that was just plain unclear---a lot of people think that 'mercury' just refers to cuda processing.</s><s> this is wrong.</s><s> to see that this was not the original intent, you need look no further than the project settings ui strings 'mercury playback engine gpu acceleration' and 'mercury playback engine software only', which would make no sense if 'mercury' meant "hardware" (i.e., cuda).</s><s> the official and up-to-date list of the cards that provide the cuda processing features is here: http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere/systemreqs/ some of the cards on that list are only enabled if you have the recent updates.</s><s> on mac os, cuda processing features of premiere pro cs5 require mac osx v10.6.3 or later.</s><s> cuda is an nvidia technology, so only nvidia cards provide it.</s><s> if you don't have one of these cuda cards, you can still use premiere pro cs5; you just won't get the advantages of processing with cuda.</s><s> here's a list of things that premiere pro cs5 can process with cuda: - some effects - scaling - deinterlacing - blending modes - color space conversions it's worth mentioning one set of things that premiere pro cs5 doesn't process using cuda: encoding and decoding.</s><s> note that whether a frame can be processed by cuda depends on the size of the frame and the amount of ram on the graphics card (vram).</s><s> this article gives details about that, toward the bottom.</s><s> processing with cuda doesn't just mean that things are faster.</s><s> in some cases, it can actually mean that results are better, as with scaling.</s><s> see this article for details.</s><s> the term 'mercury playback engine' refers to premiere pro.</s><s> it has nothing to do with after effects.</s><s> after effects cs5 is a 64-bit application, and it has been multithreaded for a long time, so those improvements are there.</s><s> but after effects doesn't use cuda (though a few third-party plug-ins do).

1. the limited list of supported cards makes the development time, manpower and support less costly for adobe, and 
2. the 'hacked' cards using non-supported cards will show if and where problems may be without any effort from adobe, apart from reading the forums, and

<s>software mpe does not use the gpu/cuda.</s><s> only hardware mpe uses the gpu/cuda and that of course depends on your timeline.</s><s> supported effects, transitions, scaling and blending used.</s><s> in some cases it can use more than 50% of the gpu processing power, in other cases only 10%.</s><s> to complicate this even further, look at the explanation on the background page of the ppbm5 benchmark 
on this benchmark test the average speed increase of hardware mpe over software mpe is around 10 x, depending on a number of other factors, like video card, cpu, memory, clock speed etc. so, for example the test takes 10 seconds with hardware mpe and 100 seconds with software mpe.

one more question, with regard to open gl 
iirc, glide and then open glide ( open gl ) was for gaming at first to draw ( using the gpu and vram ( mem on card )) complex 3d scenes etc fast, so that the cpu wasnt being used for those things that the gpu could do ( light source vectors and refraction and reflection and any number of skin related ( attributes of 3d objects ) ) ?</s><s>?</s><s>?</s><s> is that about right ?

</s><s>so "squishy" and so on is probably part of the translation from programmer ( who already knows whats up ) to " writer " who has less of a clear idea of whats up unless someone tells him.</s><s> and i wonder how many copy writers get their arms twisted to just " keep it simple " ...for the sake of getting the product delivered.</s><s> can't blame it on some conspiracy theory or something in this case.</s><s> i don't have cs5 but i haven't been misled about whats up with this stuff....</s><s> i kinda get it, from the experience i have and knowing the hardware applications from the past.</s><s> when you throw in cpu's with "new graphics abilities " like the recent news ...</s><s>i just go back to thinking how commadore and atari dealt with "player missle" stuff.... somehow i doubt its gonna matter to my editing.

<s>todd, others, one of the things i'm still a bit unsure about is the difference of using gpu and non-gpu mercury when it comes to real-time playback. 
</s><s>when i added my cards, i guess i assumed my realtime playback would either stay the same, or in some cases improve, due to processing being conducted by the gpu. 
</s><s>what i have found in some of my hdv projects, especially where i have an embedded ae comp, is that i can't get anything approaching realtime playback, unless i turn off gpu assistance and go back to software only. 
</s><s>so i'm wondering, if i can't get realtime using the gpu, do i need a better card, a better machine, or both?</s><s> are there cases where using the gpu is not advised/appropriate?
