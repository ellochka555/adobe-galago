i cannot yet identify a trigger for organizer crashing.</s><s> it must have happened 30 times or so in the last couple of weeks.</s><s> sometimes it happens when i am just scrolling thropugh the thumbnails.</s><s> it has happened when i have blocked say 10 images for deletion so i have learnt to only do 2 or 3 at a time.</s><s> it always reopens ok.</s><s> i have not used editor too much so far but it has performed fine on the work i have done.

</s><s>to import my catalogue i connected my usb separate back up hard drive (freeagent) to import the files into mac finder and then used pse12 'get photos' to bring them into organizer.</s><s> i did have a bit of a learning curve with this process.</s><s> initially i used 'get photos' to import direct from the back up drive but of course i realised after a while that it was only importing thumbnails and not the files themselves.</s><s> hence i switched to importing the files first into finder and then using 'get photos'.</s><s> i also ended up with some duplicate back copies and even iphoto wanted to get involved at times.</s><s> having got everything in i then had a mega clean up session, got rid of all duplicates, made sure every thumbnail was 'connected' to its file and ran 'optimize' for good housekeeping.</s><s> i feel my catalogue is now in good shape but given the process and its size perhaps there is a question mark. 
i cannot yet identify a trigger for organizer crashing.</s><s> it must have happened 30 times or so in the last couple of weeks.</s><s> sometimes it happens when i am just scrolling thropugh the thumbnails.</s><s> it has happened when i have blocked say 10 images for deletion so i have learnt to only do 2 or 3 at a time.</s><s> it always reopens ok.</s><s> i have not used editor too much so far but it has performed fine on the work i have done.

<s>thanks barbara.</s><s> i had renamed it so altered it back to the original.</s><s> updater still stopped half way through the installation telling me to close elementsorganizerrevelagent and autoanalyzer.</s><s> so i had a go at force quit although there was seemingly nothing to quit but to my relief when i returned to updater and hit continue it carried on and completed the 12.1 installation.</s><s> so well done, i now have elements 12.1 and it is tellling me this in about photoshop elements. 
</s><s>so far, i have just checked that organizer and editor open ok which they do.</s><s> i have not yet had the courage to seriously test organizer - i will let both you and andaleeb know how i get on.</s><s> but this has got to be a promising development so once agian thanks to both of you for your help - pse is quite important to me and i have been a bit depressed about it playing up, you know brand new machine and program and all that.

<s>great news - since loading update 12.1 i have not experienced a single crash in organizer.</s><s> it seems the patch has indeed fixed the problem, matrimonial harmony has been restored in surrey, the sun is shining and the garden is alive with swathes of golden daffodils.</s><s> if wlliam wordsworth had not already done it i would burst into prose. 
</s><s>so hopefully this is the happy end of this string.</s><s> thankyou adobe for taking it on board and producing the update.</s><s> organisations are measured in how they sort issues out and i had feared nothing was going to happem until a pse13 appeared.</s><s> thankyou also to all those who have contributed to try to help me fix the problem through my darkest days although it seems our efforts were always going to be in vain - i have bust my broadband allowance in mega downloads and redownloads and i have bought enough additional ram to manage a moon landing. 
</s><s>there was just one final hurdle to cross, you will remember that neale suggested i download the pse12 trial version from the adobe website in case my dvd was not reading correctly.</s><s> well i did and despite registering it with the licence number from my dvd box, i continued to receive email telling me my world would come to an end if i did not buy the program by an ever decreasing number of days.</s><s> when i opened my study door on the morning of the 28th day i feared my shiny new imac had morphed into a three headed dragon or when i switched on it would lock up with a message saying 'we said you should have bought it, this computer will self destruct in 20 seconds, have a good day'.</s><s> but it didn't and i have now reached the calm blue waters of a properly functioing pse12 - or should i say pse12.1.

</s></quote>that's what the backup / restore function in the file menu of the organizer is for.</s><s> three very important facts to understand: 1 - the organizer does not contain your photo files, it only stores the information about your files : their location on the drive and all their properties like exif data from the camera, your tagging and rating, your albums and creations.</s><s> the catalog itself is a folder containing the database itself - catalog.pse12db - and many auxiliary files.</s><s> that catalog must be backed up up as well as your photo files.</s><s> 2 - the organizer backup saves both your catalog and your photo files in a special folder (i highly recommend using an external drive for that purpose).</s><s> that folder is not a plain copy, it can't be used as a catalog copy; but it can be used to restore the photo files and catalog not only on the original location, but elsewhere, on another folder, drive or computer, even with different os or elements version.</s><s> 3 - you could use an external backup (or copy) tool to copy your catalog folder as well as your photo files; that would enable you to copy back to the original location, but that would make restoring elsewhere very difficult.</s><s> you find the location of your catalog(s) folder(s) in the help menu, system info. copying the catalog folder is easy and much quicker than copying the full photo files library. 
</s><s>if you want to keep a working copy of your files and catalogs on an external drive (not a backup), you should first do a full backup, preferably on a different external drive, then do a restore on the destination external drive.</s><s> by the way, restoring the backup is the only 100% way of verifying if the backup is sound... but generally you are safe if you can see a backup.tly file in the backup folder.

</s></quote>that's what the backup / restore function in the file menu of the organizer is for.</s><s> three very important facts to understand: 1 - the organizer does not contain your photo files, it only stores the information about your files : their location on the drive and all their properties like exif data from the camera, your tagging and rating, your albums and creations.</s><s> the catalog itself is a folder containing the database itself - catalog.pse12db - and many auxiliary files.</s><s> that catalog must be backed up up as well as your photo files.</s><s> 2 - the organizer backup saves both your catalog and your photo files in a special folder (i highly recommend using an external drive for that purpose).</s><s> that folder is not a plain copy, it can't be used as a catalog copy; but it can be used to restore the photo files and catalog not only on the original location, but elsewhere, on another folder, drive or computer, even with different os or elements version.</s><s> 3 - you could use an external backup (or copy) tool to copy your catalog folder as well as your photo files; that would enable you to copy back to the original location, but that would make restoring elsewhere very difficult.</s><s> you find the location of your catalog(s) folder(s) in the help menu, system info. copying the catalog folder is easy and much quicker than copying the full photo files library. 
</s><s>if you want to keep a working copy of your files and catalogs on an external drive (not a backup), you should first do a full backup, preferably on a different external drive, then do a restore on the destination external drive.</s><s> by the way, restoring the backup is the only 100% way of verifying if the backup is sound... but generally you are safe if you can see a backup.tly file in the backup folder.

<subject>PE10: Crop to pixel size broken?</subject>
<post author="DaveSemm" timestamp="Mar 18, 2014 10:50 AM">
<s>firstly, i need to make it exactly a certain size, and don't have time to drag the corners, check the size, drag the corners again, check the size, undo because now it's too small, etc. 
</s><s>to make it exactly a certain size, you can type in the required width, and in theory then just move the marquee so its properly framed and hit enter.</s><s> my problem is that the marquee is the wrong size, because e.g. the image is 1234 pixels wide, and when i set it to 1230px, the marquee is wider than the image, therefore it can't be 1230px.</s><s> so either i am doing it wrong, or it has a problem. 
</s><s>the reason i think it might have a problem is that when i moved it from windows 7 x86 to windows 8.0 x64, it takes minutes to start, the title bar appears and disapperas, and it generally behaves badly.</s><s> it works much better on an older, slower pc running windows 7.

<s>certainly in 11 & 12 and i think the same applies to 10 the crop tool will crop to the dimensions you set, but it does not pay much attention to the existing image unless you also specify the resolution.   so you may have a big picture and set crop dimension of 1000x1000 but leave resolution blank.</s><s> in this circumstance you can draw a really big crop square or a really small crop square.</s><s> after the crop pse will scale the resolution so that the cropped result meets the pixel dimension you specified.   in your case you know what you want your crop dimensions to be and you effectively only want to trim off 4 pixels worth.</s><s> so in addition to the dimensions you must also specify the resolution to be the same as the image currently is.</s><s> in this way you will get a fixed size crop rectangle.   cheers, -- neale insanity is hereditary, you get it from your children   if this post or another user's post resolves the original issue, please mark the posts as correct and/or helpful accordingly.</s><s> this helps other users with similar trouble get answers to their questions quicker.</s><s> thanks.</s><s>
