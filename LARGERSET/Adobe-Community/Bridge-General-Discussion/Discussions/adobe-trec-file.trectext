<subject>Copy Bridge Preferences to another computer</subject>
<post author="bernst@fastline.com" timestamp="Mar 14, 2014 6:22 AM">
<s>in the past, when administering all our work computers, i was able to copy the adobe bridge plist file to additional computers (or user accounts on a single computer) once i had one station set up the way i wanted, so that all our computers were set up with the same settings.</s><s> this doesn't appear to be working in bridge cc.</s><s> for instance, if i change the color theme in the general preference screen and then copy the plist file to another computer it doesn't "take" on the second computer.</s><s> i have checked to make sure i have read/write access to the plist file after copying it.</s><s> am i missing something?
