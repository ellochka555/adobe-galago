</s><s>i've gone over all the other threads in this forum concerning this problem, and i would seem to meet all of adobe's criteria for successfully running this tool; and none of the fixes that worked for others are working for me. 
</s><s>dreamweaver is up to date.</s><s> my adobe id is up to date.</s><s> i have cleared browser cookies and caches, restarted everything that can be restarted, etc.</s><s> etc.</s><s> etc. all to no avail. 
i have noticed a couple weird things: after the tool failed in dw, i attempted to access it by first connecting to browserlab in my browser (no problem), then going back to dw and previewing; that actually worked but only two or three times, out of well over a dozen attempts. 
</s><s>the other thing i noticed is that in my extensions manager, there is no browserlab extension listed.</s><s> i don't know if that's normal or not; obviously, it's installed, since i have the bl panel available in dw. 
i am losing my mind over this... any help/solution would be *very* appreciated.</s><s> i'm trying to get a job out the door by tomorrow, i have come to rely on bl for ie testing since acquiring dw cs5.5, so this is putting me in an exceptionally bad situation.

1. please make sure that firebug is engaged for your page, by default firebug is not engaged (grey) in color , when engaged it turns orange color - please ensure that firebug is orange for your page 2. ensure that "net" tab of firebug is enabled 3. refresh your page

<s>hey mapletuxx, 
</s><s>please try the below steps. 
1. please make sure that firebug is engaged for your page, by default firebug is not engaged (grey) in color , when engaged it turns orange color - please ensure that firebug is orange for your page 2. ensure that "net" tab of firebug is enabled 3. refresh your page 
this will ensure that "firebug net cache" is available and will increase/improve performance for streaming assets back to bl cloud service for preview. 
please try the above steps - it should fix the issue you are running into.

<s>hello carey, 
</s><s>thanks for your reply.</s><s> here is what i did: 
(1)-i emtied the flash player cache (2)-i deleted the dw cache (3)-i upgrade from dw 12.0.2 (built 5842) to dw 12.0.3 (built 5861) result: exactly the same issue as described above: window > extensions > (empty), etc.</s><s> (4)-i reverted to dw12.0.2 using windows recovery point, hoping that this would bring back the browserlab extension, but: result: the problem still persists (even in 12.0.2, which was not causing any problems before...</s><s>) 
</s><s>so, the only way i can get back dw with a working browerlab extension is (what i already did a couple of times): first completely uninstall cs6 and then completely reinstall cs6. 
</s><s>it really puzzles me what causes this behavior.</s><s> i saw there were still a lot of cs5.5. remnants on the c drive (c:\users\[user]\appdata\etc.</s><s>).</s><s> could it be that some old (cs5.5 configuration) file conflicts with something that the dw 12.0.3 update installs? 
ps: 
i did a fresh cs6 install (so without cs5.5 remnants) on a different computer (very different hardware, firewall, etc. from my main computer).</s><s> the bowserlab extension worked flawlessly until the dw 12.0.2 update, but - again - disappeared after installing the dw 12.0.3 update.</s><s> i'm really, really puzzled even more so.</s><s> so it's not one specific computer (conflicting hardware and/or software) causing this behavior, but the dw 12.0.3. update each time i install it on no matter what computer.

<s>definitely puzzling, especially since it works fine for me (and many others). 
no, the cs5.5 remnants, especially those within your user folder, should not be causing any kind of issue.</s><s> each version is programmed to read from and write to locations specific to that version. 

</s><s>can you try clearing the csxs cache as well to ensure it's not causing an issue?</s><s> to do so, quit all adobe cs6 applications, then delete the "cs6servicemanager" folder found in: c:\users\[user]\appdata\roaming\adobe\

<s>hello carey, 
</s><s>thanks for your reply.</s><s> here is what i did: 
(1)-i emtied the flash player cache (2)-i deleted the dw cache (3)-i upgrade from dw 12.0.2 (built 5842) to dw 12.0.3 (built 5861) result: exactly the same issue as described above: window > extensions > (empty), etc.</s><s> (4)-i reverted to dw12.0.2 using windows recovery point, hoping that this would bring back the browserlab extension, but: result: the problem still persists (even in 12.0.2, which was not causing any problems before...</s><s>) 
</s><s>so, the only way i can get back dw with a working browerlab extension is (what i already did a couple of times): first completely uninstall cs6 and then completely reinstall cs6. 
</s><s>it really puzzles me what causes this behavior.</s><s> i saw there were still a lot of cs5.5. remnants on the c drive (c:\users\[user]\appdata\etc.</s><s>).</s><s> could it be that some old (cs5.5 configuration) file conflicts with something that the dw 12.0.3 update installs? 
ps: 
i did a fresh cs6 install (so without cs5.5 remnants) on a different computer (very different hardware, firewall, etc. from my main computer).</s><s> the bowserlab extension worked flawlessly until the dw 12.0.2 update, but - again - disappeared after installing the dw 12.0.3 update.</s><s> i'm really, really puzzled even more so.</s><s> so it's not one specific computer (conflicting hardware and/or software) causing this behavior, but the dw 12.0.3. update each time i install it on no matter what computer.

Ê try manually copying the folders to their appropriate directory - mine being: c:\program files (x86)\common files\adobe\cs6servicemanager\extensions Ê both folders in the patch have folders in that directory, by moving the folders in by hand this may work for people having difficulties after using the .bat file.</s><s> hope this helps!

<s>hey mapletuxx, 
</s><s>please try the below steps. 
1. please make sure that firebug is engaged for your page, by default firebug is not engaged (grey) in color , when engaged it turns orange color - please ensure that firebug is orange for your page 2. ensure that "net" tab of firebug is enabled 3. refresh your page 
this will ensure that "firebug net cache" is available and will increase/improve performance for streaming assets back to bl cloud service for preview. 
please try the above steps - it should fix the issue you are running into.

<s>Ê with the recent release of adobe browserlab for firebug addon for firefox it is now possible to preview pages on sites that require authentication. Ê Ê Ê you first setup firefox with firebug and browserlab for firebug addon: Ê install and run firefox install the firebug addon for firefox install the browserlab for firebug addon select tools -> browserlab for firebug -> options select "allow read access" and press "ok" Ê once the setup is complete you just: navigate to a site that requires authentication and enter your credentials navigate within the site to the page you want to preview select tools -> adobe browserlab for firebug -> preview local source Ê Ê Ê when preview local source is selected browserlab will tunnel files through firefox rather than getting them directly from the web.</s><s> this means that any page that you can navigate to in firefox can be previewed by browserlab in any of the browsers it supports.

<s>i am wondering if the inconsistency is caused by the browser cache at the adobe browserlab server not being cleared.</s><s> even if you set the browser to "always refresh from server," i am not convinced it always does.</s><s> really, the only way to be sure is to clear the cache and then open a new browser instance.</s><s> this may not be practical for the adobe browserlab application. 
i have also had issues with ie8 not displaying the same on my local browser and on browserlab.</s><s> i can give you an example, if you think you will have time to look at it.</s><s> it's a beta version of a public website.</s><s> please email me if you want it, as i don't want to post it here.

<s>hi, 
</s><s>i have a script attached to an iframe player api scenario that detects the end of a youtube movie and then auto jumps to a different web page.</s><s> at first, it did not work in ie (page was blank where youtube iframe was) so i had the programmer modify the script.</s><s> i tested in ie 9 and it worked. 
</s><s>now, i am wondering about lower versions of ie. checked google analytics, and it seems the most common browser for our visitors is ie 8.0, second runner up is ie 7.0. 
</s><s>thing is, i don't have access to these browsers so used ie tester, and when the page that linked to the youtube movie came up, i cannot see any of the movie controls that you'd typically get in youtube.</s><s> also, the script did not function. 
</s><s>stranger, when i clicked on the youtube link to see the movie in youtube -- same thing, the youtube controls were not there.</s><s> so now i do not know for sure if it is ie tester that is buggy and unreliable to make this determination. 
</s><s>taking a guess, but could it be that i need to adjust the height here to further expose more of the movie onscreen?</s><s> (still cannot understand why the jump to script didn't fire at end of movie though)

<s>hi, 
</s><s>i have a script attached to an iframe player api scenario that detects the end of a youtube movie and then auto jumps to a different web page.</s><s> at first, it did not work in ie (page was blank where youtube iframe was) so i had the programmer modify the script.</s><s> i tested in ie 9 and it worked. 
</s><s>now, i am wondering about lower versions of ie. checked google analytics, and it seems the most common browser for our visitors is ie 8.0, second runner up is ie 7.0. 
</s><s>thing is, i don't have access to these browsers so used ie tester, and when the page that linked to the youtube movie came up, i cannot see any of the movie controls that you'd typically get in youtube.</s><s> also, the script did not function. 
</s><s>stranger, when i clicked on the youtube link to see the movie in youtube -- same thing, the youtube controls were not there.</s><s> so now i do not know for sure if it is ie tester that is buggy and unreliable to make this determination. 
</s><s>taking a guess, but could it be that i need to adjust the height here to further expose more of the movie onscreen?</s><s> (still cannot understand why the jump to script didn't fire at end of movie though) 
function onyoutubeplayerapiready() { player = new yt.player('player', { height: '406', width: '720', videoid: 'p6eglc9on29', << phony substitute playervars: { 'theme': 'light', 'showinfo': '0', 'rel': '0', 'modestbranding': '1' } 
</s><s>hoping this info is a good start!

one more thing, when i can actually log in, it looks like its trying to display home page with browser drop down in upper left, but it just goes grey and there are no browser choices under the "down arrow". this is true on 2 macs ive tried and 2 pcs?</s><s>?</s><s>?</s><s>?</s><s>

Ê would emulation (i.e. presenting screenshots in the desired screen size in a webkit browser) be sufficient for your needs?</s><s> that would help find some layout issues, but likely would miss some quirks in individual browsers/devices.</s><s> are static screenshots of page "states" good enough, or do you need to be able to test animations/transitions?</s><s> if not, what would be sufficient?</s><s> do you need the capability to do interactive testing (i.e. being able to live "click" and interact with the page running on the mobile device)?</s><s> how important is it that we offer a complete array of all the latest devices? Ê please give us an idea of which of those things are absolutely necessary, which would be really nice to have, and which just sound cool, but you can live without.</s><s> the more people we get answering these questions, the more it helps us understand what everyone's needs are.

<s>thanks mark, all good questions. 
</s><s>from my perspective, while it would be great to have a means to test navigation, animation, multi-touch gestures etc., the best first step would be the static screenshots.</s><s> this would serve developers and designers alike in enabling them to at least see if content is displaying as intended.

<s>here's another vote for mobile emulation.

<s>hi, Ê sorry for the delay in responding to this.</s><s> i'd forwarded it on to our product manager to respond, but he's currently on vacation. Ê until he gets back, i can tell you that yes, we are exploring ways we can offer this sort of support, either through browserlab itself or through other kinds of tooling.</s><s> bruce should be able to give you a better response when he returns, but until then, let me ask you (and any others interested in this), some questions about what you'd like to see. Ê would emulation (i.e. presenting screenshots in the desired screen size in a webkit browser) be sufficient for your needs?</s><s> that would help find some layout issues, but likely would miss some quirks in individual browsers/devices.</s><s> are static screenshots of page "states" good enough, or do you need to be able to test animations/transitions?</s><s> if not, what would be sufficient?</s><s> do you need the capability to do interactive testing (i.e. being able to live "click" and interact with the page running on the mobile device)?</s><s> how important is it that we offer a complete array of all the latest devices? Ê please give us an idea of which of those things are absolutely necessary, which would be really nice to have, and which just sound cool, but you can live without.</s><s> the more people we get answering these questions, the more it helps us understand what everyone's needs are.

<s>thanks mark, all good questions. 
</s><s>from my perspective, while it would be great to have a means to test navigation, animation, multi-touch gestures etc., the best first step would be the static screenshots.</s><s> this would serve developers and designers alike in enabling them to at least see if content is displaying as intended. 
</s><s>as for device coverage, i'm more concerned with screen size and browser/os than anything else, so perhaps a menu to select 'android' or 'ios' at 320 x 480.</s><s> the device itself doesn't matter as much other than input method (touch, trackball, etc.</s><s>).</s><s> that should limit the variables a good deal.

<s>here's another vote for mobile emulation. 
i would like to see ios, android and blackberry support for their native resolutions.</s><s> and ipad and other tablets as well.</s><s> also, a little button that will allow you to change your screen orientation from portrait to landscape and back again, like to simulate if you're holding your iphone vertical or horizontal. or just show both views side by side, but that wouldn't work as good for tablets with their higher resolutions... 
</s><s>maybe to start with it might be as easy as just using your latest safari or chrome emulator and just shrinking the viewable window size down to 320x480.

<s>flash player is installed on your computer.</s><s> browserlab is a flash player application and your screenshot of browserlab shows me our swf running in the player.</s><s> please click on this link in safari: http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/find-version-flash-player.html and tell me what version number is shown on section 2 of that webpage. 
</s><s>the reason you're getting that message and browserlab can't log you in is because when our swf is attempting to log you in, we send your credentials to the server and for some reason that communication is being blocked.</s><s> it seems it must be an issue with your machine/os/configuration.</s><s> the oddest thing about this is that your browser is able to reach our servers but the swf running inside that browser seems not to be able to do so.</s><s> hence, that's why i asked the question again about a firewall, ad-blocker software and your security settings in safari.</s><s> can you think of anything that you've changed on that computer between the time browserlab was working for you and now that might possibly have affected those settings or the ability of flash player to make calls to a webservice? 
</s><s>does this this computer have an internet connection you control or does someone else control it (e.g.</s><s> a work network configured by it)?</s><s> is there possibly another network you could switch the computer over to and try to log in from there?

<s>hi santhi chand, 
you didn't post the url you're testing, so i can't be sure this answer is correct, but it sounds like the page you're testing requires flash player 11.1.</s><s> we haven't updated browserlab in a while (though we plan to do that soon), so much the same as we're behind on browser versions, we're also behind on the flash player version we have installed on our browser servers. 
</s><s>i'm not sure if it's possible for you, but a simple workaround for this issue would be to lower the minimum player required version number to 10 on the page(s) you're testing.</s><s> does the content you have there actually require that player 11 be installed? 
</s><s>if this isn't the problem, please post the url you're testing so we can take a look at it ourselves.

<s>right, what you're seeing is an error message on our browser server because we don't have flash 11.1 installed on those machines yet.</s><s> compiling with flash builder 4.6 means that you're building for flash player 11 or higher.</s><s> we should be updating those machines with a number of updates (including player 11) over the next 2-4 weeks.</s><s> until then, if you'd like to be able to use browserlab to test your site, you might be able to download the flex 4.0 sdk (which requires player 10) and compile with that rather than the flex 4.6 sdk.

<subject>BrowserLab problems - used to work, can no longer connect now</subject>
<post author="sequentialtom" timestamp="Feb 5, 2012 5:33 PM">
<s>i was using browser lab thru dreamweaver cs5.5 (v11.5, build 5344) with no problems whatsoever until recently.</s><s> for no apparent reason, it stopped working.</s><s> now when i try to connect, i just get that "preparing for preview..." progress bar that never goes away. 
</s><s>i've gone over all the other threads in this forum concerning this problem, and i would seem to meet all of adobe's criteria for successfully running this tool; and none of the fixes that worked for others are working for me. 
</s><s>dreamweaver is up to date.</s><s> my adobe id is up to date.</s><s> i have cleared browser cookies and caches, restarted everything that can be restarted, etc.</s><s> etc.</s><s> etc. all to no avail. 
i have noticed a couple weird things: after the tool failed in dw, i attempted to access it by first connecting to browserlab in my browser (no problem), then going back to dw and previewing; that actually worked but only two or three times, out of well over a dozen attempts. 
</s><s>the other thing i noticed is that in my extensions manager, there is no browserlab extension listed.</s><s> i don't know if that's normal or not; obviously, it's installed, since i have the bl panel available in dw. 
i am losing my mind over this... any help/solution would be *very* appreciated.</s><s> i'm trying to get a job out the door by tomorrow, i have come to rely on bl for ie testing since acquiring dw cs5.5, so this is putting me in an exceptionally bad situation.

<s>hi mark, 
</s><s>fair enough, i guess it should come as no surprise that you're very busy and i certainly can empathize with that.</s><s> i let my frustration get the better of me and i may have been, well, starting to panic a bit.. perhaps it's time to re-read that hitchhiker's guide 
in any case, i do greatly appreciate your reply, thank you very much.</s><s> and your particular response about my 'license status' gave me the first good laugh i've had all day.</s><s> right you are.</s><s> 
</s><s>to the point, then: 
1.</s><s> i'm running mac os 10.6.8 2.</s><s> bl version no. is: 1.6.0.971m.273042 3.</s><s> it's not an error message, just the endless "preparing for preview..." progress bar.</s><s> it only goes away if i cancel the preview.</s><s> i've not yet seen any error message, even though i've let that bar 'spin' for a *long* time.</s><s> here: 
</s><s>4. as requested: 
5. yes, that option has been there ever since i installed the bl extension back in the summer: 

</s><s>like i said this all worked just fine... until it didn't.</s><s> i'm at a loss to explain what could've changed.</s><s> i spent literally hours trying to figure this out w/o success.</s><s> the only "change" i'm aware of at this point, is that i changed my adobe id password since originally installing the bl extension in dw; but i've updated that at the cs live site already, and the problem persists.</s><s> and anyway, i really can't imagine that would account for the missing extension weirdness, and it also seems to me that if that were the problem, i wouldn't have been able to access bl the way i described in my first post (please let me repeat that that method only worked about 2 or 3 times out of a good 15-20 attempts; i've had no success getting it to work again). 
</s><s>so..</s><s> a good puzzle here?</s><s> i do hope you enjoy them...</s><s> i have not been having fun w/ this 
thanks again for your reply mark, and i will patiently (but eagerly) await your answer.

<s>mark, 
</s><s>that was it!</s><s> deleting that keychain entry did the trick.</s><s> i think i went through every thread under "browser lab", but i didn't have the insight to look under "cs live".</s><s> i actually never used that button before, that screenshot i posted was the result of my first attemp.</s><s> can't tell you how happy i am to have this resolved! 
</s><s>for the potential benefit of anyone else who finds their way to this thread, i should mention that my keychain entry did *not* start w/ "adobe-cs-live..." as indicated in the thread you linked me to; it was actually "adobe-cs-5.5-renga".</s><s> debated for a sec if that was the right one, figured it must be since it was in the login items section along w/ all my ftp server passes.
