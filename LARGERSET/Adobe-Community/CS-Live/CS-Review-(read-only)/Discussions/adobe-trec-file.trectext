<s>i just wanted to provide an update to what is going on with our missing cs reviews. 
</s><s>quick summary: adobe shut down the adobe cs review service.</s><s> the only notification to users was through a forum post.</s><s> we are in contact with support trying to retrieve our clients' review comments. 
</s><s>full story: i spent three hours this morning calling into adobe support several times until i found a rep who actually took the time to dig in and find out what was going on with adobe cs review (thanks michael!</s><s>).</s><s> his answer was "sorry, the adobe cs review service has been taken offline and is no longer available, with or without a paid subscription to acrobat.com." he was not able do anything. 
i asked to be escalated to the customer support manager to see what could be done.</s><s> michael's manager, chris promptly called me back and we discussed the issues at hand. 
</s><s>here's a quick summary of our call: adobe cs review has been retired.</s><s> it won't be back.</s><s> this is impacting our business in a significant way.</s><s> business revenue is tied to our reviews and billing is tied to different stages of review.</s><s> our clients have spent numerous hours on each review and all of their work is currently lost.</s><s> if we are unable to get their review comments, we're going to have to deal with some seriously upset clients.</s><s> adobe's only communication to adobe cs review users that the service was going to be shut down was a notification posted on the catalyst forum.</s><s> no email notification was sent.</s><s> no notification was posted in the adobe cs review user interface.</s><s> so the only way to get notice was to log into that forum.</s><s> chris and i agreed that this was not a good way to communicate to users that the service was going to be taken offline and that data would be lost.</s><s> had adobe sent notification to users, we would have exported every review as a pdf that contained all our client comments. 
</s><s>where we are now: we currently have 13 active client reviews, 5 of which are very time sensitive.</s><s> at this point all of my client review comments have been taken offline and are not available.</s><s> chris and his team do not have access to this information and cannot retrieve it.</s><s> chris has escalated my case to the next support level with a priority of urgent.</s><s> i should expect a call back from the next support level within 24-48 hours. 
</s><s>what we are hoping for: we just need our client comments.</s><s> we don't need adobe cs review back online.</s><s> we don't need pretty.</s><s> we just need our data.</s><s> the review comments still exist.</s><s> they should... somewhere.</s><s> any it group worth their salt has this data backed up somewhere.</s><s> i'm hoping that minimally we can get a text dump of all our client review comments made in adobe cs review.</s><s> i'll parse and re-create our client reviews somewhere else. 
</s><s>i'll provide another update as soon as i get to the next step. 
</s><s>thanks again to michael and chris for helping us out with this.</s><s> we really appreciate your effort and understanding! -mike

<s>hello, 
</s><s>all my content has disappeared on acrobat.com.</s><s> i know there were a change on april the 12th (i can't retrieve this info anyway), i also know that this was a trial period for me, but it is a little bit aggressive to remove all the content without any advice......</s><s> i would understand you won't allow me for new changes, but i don't understand why all has disappeared !</s><s> or maybe it is a bug ? 
</s><s>anyway, i still have one working space, with the good name, but all my images and people with whom i have shared them have disappeared.</s><s> totally.</s><s> thanks for helping on this !

<s>i still can't believe they have not drafted a better response to the lame announcement that contradicts prior announcements that cs review was going to be a subscription service.</s><s> going back to dropbox is a terrible option.</s><s> cs review finally provided the ability to get comments down to timepoints that were easy to navigate back in the editing process.</s><s> it improved our workflow immensely, especially since our customers are the type who dont know how to describe issues well and are well versed in file types.</s><s> i called them the day of this announcement and was put on a wild goose chase through customer service that ended with being disconnected. 
</s><s>we will pay for this service. 
update: here is the feedback address, hopefully their team has not been dismantled: csreview_feedback@adobe.com

<s>i would encourage everyone that agrees with this to also flood the "help" submission of the cs review site .</s><s> does anyone have a contact in adobe? 
i would like to hear the logic of what they are going to do and why they can not offer a continuation of this service based on demand?</s><s> cs review is a great way for them to differentiate the platform from fcp etc. ......

<s>adobe have stated their position on the faq, to the extent they are able to.</s><s> this is a commercial market, and explaining why something has been dropped or what else may be in development would give their competitors valuable information. 
</s><s>if you email the help address they will simply repeat what's on the faq (assuming you get an answer at all).</s><s> there may be an additional statement in due course, but these forums aren't the place to look for it.

<s>i've just posted this e-mail to csreview_feedback@adobe.com and i hope they will answer our questions regarding cs review on their own forum. 
</s><s>dear feedback team, 
please give me and your other customers feedback.</s><s> we're not pleased by the way you treat us in the case of stopping the cs review service, and giving us no alternative or information.</s><s> i would like to receive your answer and i'm sure it will be much apreciated if you also answer the questions from your own customers on the forum of your own company: http://forums.adobe.com/message/4263901#4263901

<s>just started using this great reviewing process.</s><s> bummer adobe doesn't see the future for it.</s><s> i totally think it wasn't marketed or made aware to enough of their users.</s><s> i too think it would put adobe way ahead of avid or apple in this respect.</s><s> they have nothing to compare to this app.</s><s> heck, this app alone should sell more copies of pp, in my opinion.</s><s> my clients and i sure will be sad if there is no alternative from adobe.

<s>these are user-to-user forums, so while there are some adobe staff posting here on a voluntary basis who will assist with technical product queries, they will not make policy announcements here or in personal messages.</s><s> all official statements are posted to the product page (in this case to the cs review homepage).</s><s> suggestions to "flood" the support email address are totally counter-productive. 
i appreciate that customers using cs review want to know why the free version is being discontinued and if there will ever be a replacement service, but those who could answer are not allowed to.</s><s> of course adobe are aware of our concerns, but as a company with shareholders they have to be very careful about what and when they make public.
