<s>yes, that's a chroma-key mask (where you pick one color from the possible color set).</s><s> you could also do a regular stencil mask, but that's the hard one.</s><s> smask would be simpler since you could leave the palette in place but then make a full set in there - a definitely option if you are ok with adding transparency of that type to the document.
