<s>hello, 
</s><s>never heard the name pointer rgb, but this somewhat irregularly shaped contour can be explained.</s><s> it is the gamut of optimal surface colors under a certain illuminant (for printers d50).</s><s> optimal surface colors have reflectance spectra with value 1 as one solid block (and 0 elsewhere) or as a combination of two solid blocks for magentas (as well one solid block, if we bend the spectrum to a circle).</s><s> so far we would get a smooth contour, but together with a dxx illuminant the contour looks rough (should be smooth for illuminant equal energy or illuminant a).</s><s> now we see immediately, that this surface color gamut changes, depending on the illuminant, or simply on the scene light, of course not exceeding the horseshoe contour. 
</s><s>some remarks on the choice of primaries: 
for a working space (like srgb, adobe rgb, prophoto, cielab) any coordinate system can be used.</s><s> the accuracy is affected by the number format (bit depth for integers or type of floating point format).</s><s> it's probably annoying, that in some cases arbitrary numbers (though elements of the set of numbers of binary coding) are nonsensical, like blue and red primaries and their neighbours for prophoto or many numbers in cielab, for instance 0l* 10a* 20b* or 90l* 30a* 20b*.</s><s> nonlinearities affect the accuracy further. 
</s><s>for monitors the situation is very different.</s><s> the primaries have to be chosen so, that for each primary with limited radiometric power a significant photometric output is achieved.</s><s> for instance red at 700nm is almost invisible.

<s>hello, 
</s><s>never heard the name pointer rgb, but this somewhat irregularly shaped contour can be explained.</s><s> it is the gamut of optimal surface colors under a certain illuminant (for printers d50).</s><s> optimal surface colors have reflectance spectra with value 1 as one solid block (and 0 elsewhere) or as a combination of two solid blocks for magentas (as well one solid block, if we bend the spectrum to a circle).</s><s> so far we would get a smooth contour, but together with a dxx illuminant the contour looks rough (should be smooth for illuminant equal energy or illuminant a).</s><s> now we see immediately, that this surface color gamut changes, depending on the illuminant, or simply on the scene light, of course not exceeding the horseshoe contour. 
</s><s>some remarks on the choice of primaries: 
for a working space (like srgb, adobe rgb, prophoto, cielab) any coordinate system can be used.</s><s> the accuracy is affected by the number format (bit depth for integers or type of floating point format).</s><s> it's probably annoying, that in some cases arbitrary numbers (though elements of the set of numbers of binary coding) are nonsensical, like blue and red primaries and their neighbours for prophoto or many numbers in cielab, for instance 0l* 10a* 20b* or 90l* 30a* 20b*.</s><s> nonlinearities affect the accuracy further. 
</s><s>for monitors the situation is very different.</s><s> the primaries have to be chosen so, that for each primary with limited radiometric power a significant photometric output is achieved.</s><s> for instance red at 700nm is almost invisible.

<s>i'm really happy about these questions.</s><s> my private rgb space optirgb is as arbitrary as – many years ago – brucergb, which had been propagated as a big progress.</s><s> optirgb was an exercise, how to pack the information into an icc profile, and of course with a reasonable choice of the primaries. 
a friend of mine is a well-known photographer, who had contributed very much in the field of landscape photography to calenders and travel books: https://www.google.de/search?hl=de&as_q=fotograf&as_epq=norbert+kustos &as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=lang_de&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch =&as_occt=any&safe=images&as_filetype=&as_rights= 
some years ago we had all these discussions, and my part had been mainly the introduction into lab editing, soft proofing and generally into the production of print-ready cmyk files, or in other words, how to respect the limits of offset printing.</s><s> in cooperation with editors of calendars and books it turned out as the best choice, starting with raw, to prepare the files in adobergb, but of course after modifying and verifying the printability by soft proofing.</s><s> by the way: the rendering of these photos is always done by preferred reproduction (just as we like, but our opinions differ occasionally), never by colorimetrical reproduction.

<s>first let us consider a case of accurate color reproduction:   a painting is illuminated by flash, approximately 5000k.</s><s> an image is taken by a color-calibrated camera.</s><s> after the assignment of the camera profile the image is not further processed but printed by a calibrated printer.</s><s> the print is put aside the painting.</s><s> both look alike under d50 and under different  roomlight (in limits).</s><s> both together can be shot again – they will look alike in the image.</s><s> the whole process – camera calibration, image handling, printer calibration – is fully controlled by cie colorimetry.</s><s> inherent nonlinearities, like inverse gamma encoding, are compensated somewhere else in inverse order.</s><s> the process is linear.</s><s> the printing is not really linear, but there are definitely no corrections for perceptual appearance, because the viewing conditions are the same for the original painting and the reproduction.</s><s> cielab values are preserved or regenerated, e.g. by applying the camera profile.   in this example just a little more contrast had been added, not touching the automatic color correction: http://docs-hoffmann.de/camcal17122006.pdf see p.13.   if the viewing conditions are different, then the theories of color appearance models (mark fairchild and others) offer means how to modify an image for different types of illuminants, backgrounds, surrounds, etc. http://www.amazon.de/appearance-imaging-science-technology-fairchild/d p/b00ih7711o/ref=sr_1_1/277-9872972-1598965?s=books&ie=utf8&qid=139297 8327&sr=1-1&keywords=fairchild+color   second, let us consider the 'gamma question', traditionally in the context of tv with cathode ray tubes:   here i'm following mainly these books   r.w.g.hunt, the reproduction of colour (this not the same as measuring colour) http://www.amazon.de/reproduction-colour-imaging-science-technology/dp /0470024259/ref=sr_1_1/280-6435932-5887840?s=books-intl-de&ie=utf8&qid =1392977381&sr=1-1&keywords=hunt+reproduction+of+colour   giorgianni + madden, digital color management http://www.amazon.de/digital-color-management-encoding-solutions/dp/02 01634260/ref=sr_1_1/280-6435932-5887840?s=books-intl-de&ie=utf8&qid=13 92977326&sr=1-1&keywords=giorgianni+madden   and my own doc: http://docs-hoffmann.de/gamquest18102001.pdf    a scene photo is taken by a video camera.</s><s> a crt monitor has an overall transfer function between control voltage y and luminance z like z=y^g, with gamma g=2.8.</s><s> the camera signal y can be created from scene luminance x by y=x^(1/g)  which would result in an overall gamma of 1.0.</s><s> actually, tv monitors are not viewed in entirely dark rooms.</s><s> there is always some flare (stray light).</s><s> this requires an increased artificial contrast (a kind of early color appearance model correction, but mainly for luminance, though useful for better saturation in color tv as well).  finally we have y=x^(1/2.2)=x^0.4545 and z=y^2.8, which results in z=x^1.28 or so.   now we can see, that different viewing conditions require (theoretically) modifications  of  the image in order to create the same appearance.    brightness depends in a nonlinear fashion from object luminance and the background, see fig.1 here: http://www.google.de/imgres?imgurl=http://www.purveslab.net/img/lumina nce_fig_1.gif&imgrefurl=http://www.purveslab.net/research/explanation/ brightness/luminance.html&h=350&w=440&sz=26&tbnid=wwqocdedvsy20m:&tbnh =90&tbnw=113&zoom=1&usg=__sqe3dym_5_v9fuy_e3nzk-tnvie=&docid=d6tgzqz8r cb13m&hl=de&sa=x&ei=hwkgu9azcmtoygpyiigaba&ved=0cgyq9qewbjgk&dur=536 but these curves are not used for active correction.</s><s> just the same as the helmholtz-kohlrausch effect: vibrant red appears with 'exaggerated' brightness, but this happens in the scene and in the reproduction as well.</s><s> thus, corrections are not required,  as long as the color is in-gamut for all devices.   i hope this explanation will shed some light on this rather complex scientific area.</s><s> there is one (implicit) question not yet answered: under which conditions is luminance y a good correlate for brightness?</s><s> it would be necessary to read more about color appearance (e.g.</s><s> fairchild).   best regards --gernot hoffmann

<s>you're welcome, i have time enough and i like your questions – the same as i asked many years ago.   1.</s><s> gamma is not related with the human vision at all.   the nonlinear brightness-luminance function of vision is not the basic reason for gamma encoding.</s><s> there is just one objection remaining: the resolution in dark areas should be larger than in light areas.</s><s> this is true only if the eye is dark adapted, see test images p.17: http://docs-hoffmann.de/gamquest18102001.pdf then one should have more levels per luminance unit in the dark than in the bright.</s><s> if the source is in 8 bpc (bits per channel) then the application of y=x^(1/g) produces an overall loss of levels (184 instead of 256) and large gaps in y in the dark region, is therefore entirely useless.</s><s> aha – one needs a source with more bits, for instance 12, 14 or 16bpc.   2.</s><s> human being needs just the linear scene luminances for extracting the brightness information.</s><s> our eyes have already a gamma embedded in it for extracting the brightness values from the linear secene luminances, so we don't need any other artificial gamma.</s><s> that's my opinion too.</s><s> if we didn't have the phenomenon of 'brightness', then image processing would be just the same.   3.</s><s> we don't need, but in the past, the crt displays needed the gamma for linearizing the signal arriving to the crt displays.</s><s> yes, the first step is establishing linearity from scene view to display view.</s><s> the second step may be a correction because of the viewing conditions.   4.</s><s> today we need it for two reasons: one of them is backward compatibility and the other is our 8-bit image files.</s><s> as far as i know, lcds have approximately linear response, so if we start to use 32-bit floating point files as a new standard for image files in the future (poynton says even 16-bit files would be enough), we will not need gamma anymore.</s><s> at this point, we will have inherently linear systems for tone reproduction on our displays.</s><s> yes, my opinion as well.</s><s> this issue with banding in dark areas for 8bpc images may arise in synthetical images (gradients, computer graphics), but not in real-world photos.</s><s> some tests are here: http://docs-hoffmann.de/optigray06102001.pdf   an interesting discussion about brightness, lightness, gamma etc (year 2006): https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sci.engr.color/z95jl-oa6ce   please note, my old urls (as found in the internet) are no more valid, e.g.: http://www.fho-emden.de/~hoffmann/howww41a.html please replace by: http://docs-hoffmann.de/howww41a.html   there have been endless discussions about this 'gamma question' in the internet since about 15 years.</s><s> and it's still going on... http://photo.net/digital-darkroom-forum/00adn8   best regards --gernot hoffmann

<s>you're welcome, i have time enough and i like your questions – the same as i asked many years ago.   1.</s><s> gamma is not related with the human vision at all.   the nonlinear brightness-luminance function of vision is not the basic reason for gamma encoding.</s><s> there is just one objection remaining: the resolution in dark areas should be larger than in light areas.</s><s> this is true only if the eye is dark adapted, see test images p.17: http://docs-hoffmann.de/gamquest18102001.pdf then one should have more levels per luminance unit in the dark than in the bright.</s><s> if the source is in 8 bpc (bits per channel) then the application of y=x^(1/g) produces an overall loss of levels (184 instead of 256) and large gaps in y in the dark region, is therefore entirely useless.</s><s> aha – one needs a source with more bits, for instance 12, 14 or 16bpc.   2.</s><s> human being needs just the linear scene luminances for extracting the brightness information.</s><s> our eyes have already a gamma embedded in it for extracting the brightness values from the linear secene luminances, so we don't need any other artificial gamma.</s><s> that's my opinion too.</s><s> if we didn't have the phenomenon of 'brightness', then image processing would be just the same.   3.</s><s> we don't need, but in the past, the crt displays needed the gamma for linearizing the signal arriving to the crt displays.</s><s> yes, the first step is establishing linearity from scene view to display view.</s><s> the second step may be a correction because of the viewing conditions.   4.</s><s> today we need it for two reasons: one of them is backward compatibility and the other is our 8-bit image files.</s><s> as far as i know, lcds have approximately linear response, so if we start to use 32-bit floating point files as a new standard for image files in the future (poynton says even 16-bit files would be enough), we will not need gamma anymore.</s><s> at this point, we will have inherently linear systems for tone reproduction on our displays.</s><s> yes, my opinion as well.</s><s> this issue with banding in dark areas for 8bpc images may arise in synthetical images (gradients, computer graphics), but not in real-world photos.</s><s> some tests are here: http://docs-hoffmann.de/optigray06102001.pdf   an interesting discussion about brightness, lightness, gamma etc (year 2006): https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sci.engr.color/z95jl-oa6ce   please note, my old urls (as found in the internet) are no more valid, e.g.: http://www.fho-emden.de/~hoffmann/howww41a.html please replace by: http://docs-hoffmann.de/howww41a.html   there have been endless discussions about this 'gamma question' in the internet since about 15 years.</s><s> and it's still going on... http://photo.net/digital-darkroom-forum/00adn8   best regards --gernot hoffmann

<s>i openly confess to being a beginner (who is seriously trying to learn more) when it comes to color management so i ask you to please be kind. 
i am a photographer and i work mainly with stock photo agencies who offer images to photo users.</s><s> even though almost of the photo uses are for magazine and book publishers who use offset printers, stock agencies all require rgb files.</s><s> i recently discovered the "gamut warning" button in ps cs4 and it has changed the way i think about digital photography.</s><s> when the gamut warning is activated, virtually every photo that i take contains large amounts of out-of-gamut colors, especially in the yellow-green range.</s><s> if i were over-saturating or over-manipulating my images then i could understand it, but even photos straight out of the camera with no tweaking or correction of any kind have huge areas of unprintable colors.</s><s> i'm using pretty standard color settings in photoshop. 
</s><s>according to a popular book that deals with photoshop for photographers, the only way of dealing with this situation is to select> color range> out of gamut and then use hue/saturation to de-saturate the offending pixels until the gray gamut warning overlay disappears.</s><s> this is easy to do, but i have to de-saturate the image until the yellows-greens are almost gray.</s><s> the overall effect on the image is disastrous. 
</s><s>i've found that converting my rgb file to cmyk (using the relative colorimetric setting) and then back to rgb produces a much better looking image (only slightly unsaturated, but not objectionably so) but this seems like the wrong way to correct the situation and even though the resulting colors look smooth when viewed on my monitor at 100% i can't help but wonder if some sort of image degradation must occur.

<s>i would not throw in an extra conversion to cmyk and go back to rgb.</s><s> a few points to consider: 
1. there are many different cmyk color spaces.</s><s> some are much larger than others.</s><s> the gamut warning hinges on your proof setup cmyk space – if you are in u.s., this would default to us web coated swop v2.</s><s> just be certain that the cmyk is appropriate for your project (check with your printer). 
2.</s><s> use proof setup.</s><s> then you can view the conversion and preserve the source rgb.

i am a photographer and i work mainly with stock photo agencies who offer images to photo users.</s><s> even though almost of the photo uses are for magazine and book publishers who use offset printers, stock agencies all require rgb files.</s><s> i recently discovered the "gamut warning" button in ps cs4 and it has changed the way i think about digital photography.</s><s> when the gamut warning is activated, virtually every photo that i take contains large amounts of out-of-gamut colors, especially in the yellow-green range.</s><s> if i were over-saturating or over-manipulating my images then i could understand it, but even photos straight out of the camera with no tweaking or correction of any kind have huge areas of unprintable colors.</s><s> i'm using pretty standard color settings in photoshop. 
</s><s>according to a popular book that deals with photoshop for photographers, the only way of dealing with this situation is to select> color range> out of gamut and then use hue/saturation to de-saturate the offending pixels until the gray gamut warning overlay disappears.</s><s> this is easy to do, but i have to de-saturate the image until the yellows-greens are almost gray.</s><s> the overall effect on the image is disastrous. 
</s><s>i've found that converting my rgb file to cmyk (using the relative colorimetric setting) and then back to rgb produces a much better looking image (only slightly unsaturated, but not objectionably so) but this seems like the wrong way to correct the situation and even though the resulting colors look smooth when viewed on my monitor at 100% i can't help but wonder if some sort of image degradation must occur.

<s>for web, email and screen in general it should always be srgb.</s><s> then you can be fairly certain that it will display correctly (more or less) in any scenario. srgb wil also work for print (inkjet), it's just that many colors that can be printed are out of srgb gamut, so it's a restriction that doesn't need to be there. srgb is a small color space that can't reproduce very saturated colors - they're just clipped.</s><s> so it's better to start with a larger space like adobe rgb or even prophoto. 
</s><s>for editing purposes you want a large color space simply to have headroom and not hit the wall at every move.</s><s> the final destination may well be a smaller space, like a printer profile.</s><s> the software then converts to that destination profile as it goes to the printer.</s><s> you can soft proof to the printer profile to get an impression of how the final result will look. 
</s><s>you can print directly from indesign, but the typical indesign workflow is to export a finished pdf.</s><s> that is where you specify a final destination profile for the whole document, whether a certain cmyk profile for offset press, or an rgb profile for screen.</s><s> so you have your master indesign file, and output pdfs for each destination.</s><s> the indesign file can contain placed rgb images in any color space, while text and graphic elements are cmyk.</s><s> then everything is converted in one go at export. 
</s><s>you should always go through the pdf export dialog carefully.</s><s> use the presets, but don't automatically accept defaults.</s><s> for specific purposes, ask here or in the indesign forum, where they deal with this all the time. 
</s><s>for screen, under "output" use convert to destination, srgb, include profile.</s><s> under "compression", things aren't as obvious as they used to be (downsample to 96 or 100 ppi), because of the new retina displays that can benefit from a higher resolution.</s><s> i hold my judgement on this one.

<s>but if you reccomend adobe rgb over srgb in indesign because the latter has a too narrow color space, why stick with srgb when pushing interface pixels and bitmap graphics in ps?</s><s> to be honest, my perception is that the end user doesn't have a clue about calibrating their monitors so what they get is in the end all the same.</s><s> alltough i may put effort into getting an exact red tone we all know how inpredictable that outcome is when it hits the user monitor.

</s><s>by the way, isn't all the monitors out there based on the same rgb color concept?</s><s> so when they look at graphics it's all down to hardware in terms of what quality they receive on the image.</s><s> i mean, outdated graphic boards generates a crappy result, a wore down old monitor with no light the same.</s><s> a high-end top of the line proffessional monitor is a complete different story.</s><s> so srgb or adobe rgb or "whatever rgb" - dunno how cruical it is in the end.

<s>for web, email and screen in general it should always be srgb.</s><s> then you can be fairly certain that it will display correctly (more or less) in any scenario. srgb wil also work for print (inkjet), it's just that many colors that can be printed are out of srgb gamut, so it's a restriction that doesn't need to be there. srgb is a small color space that can't reproduce very saturated colors - they're just clipped.</s><s> so it's better to start with a larger space like adobe rgb or even prophoto. 
</s><s>for editing purposes you want a large color space simply to have headroom and not hit the wall at every move.</s><s> the final destination may well be a smaller space, like a printer profile.</s><s> the software then converts to that destination profile as it goes to the printer.</s><s> you can soft proof to the printer profile to get an impression of how the final result will look. 
</s><s>you can print directly from indesign, but the typical indesign workflow is to export a finished pdf.</s><s> that is where you specify a final destination profile for the whole document, whether a certain cmyk profile for offset press, or an rgb profile for screen.</s><s> so you have your master indesign file, and output pdfs for each destination.</s><s> the indesign file can contain placed rgb images in any color space, while text and graphic elements are cmyk.</s><s> then everything is converted in one go at export. 
</s><s>you should always go through the pdf export dialog carefully.</s><s> use the presets, but don't automatically accept defaults.</s><s> for specific purposes, ask here or in the indesign forum, where they deal with this all the time. 
</s><s>for screen, under "output" use convert to destination, srgb, include profile.</s><s> under "compression", things aren't as obvious as they used to be (downsample to 96 or 100 ppi), because of the new retina displays that can benefit from a higher resolution.</s><s> i hold my judgement on this one.

<s>working spaces are ok, but you also need to go down to color management policies.</s><s> for rgb you currently have "off" (desactivar).</s><s> this is a setting you should never use, it'll get you into big trouble, fast.</s><s> it's only there for very special purposes.</s><s> for cmyk you have "convert to working space" which is not quite as bad, but also very risky. 
</s><s>set both to "preserve embedded profiles".</s><s> this is the safe route.</s><s> it's also a good idea to check all the three warnings, so that you know when you have missing profiles or mismatches. 
</s><s>so try again with that setup.</s><s> it is still perfectly possible that your pure cyan is out of srgb gamut, it simply can't be reproduced in that color space because it's too saturated.</s><s> so what you see is the most saturated cyan possible in srgb.</s><s> primary colors in either rgb or cmyk are always difficult in the other mode.

<s>hello creativecolormn, 
</s><s>if you want to get onyx rip to print the same color from cs5 and cs6, you have to set all pantone colors as spot and not cmyk.</s><s> then, onyx will receive the same pantone name and will do the conversion with its own pantone color table. 
</s><s>the problem you have is because your pantone color are set as process cmyk and not spot color.</s><s> i agree that cmyk values between cs5 and cs6 are not the same.</s><s> this is beacause of the way pantone libraries are defined.</s><s> in cs5, the default color mode of color book is cmyk and in cs6, the default color mode of color book is lab.</s><s> you have to understand that in cs6, pantone are better simulated (as default) from start because it is using lab value.</s><s> in cs5, the pantone silmulation was not true, unless you were selecting "overprint preview" in the view menu.</s><s> this was the way to tell illustrator to use the internal lab value for pantone dispaly. 
</s><s>secondly, if you have to set your pantone in process cmyk mode, make sure that the default cmyk working space is the same as the one you are using as default in your onyx rip.</s><s> this will help to keep consistency between illustrator and the rip.

<s>hi guys, 
</s><s>i've read through this whole forum and i have found a solution to everyones problem.</s><s> it is a work around but will save everyone alot of time and hassle and so far it hasn't let me down. 
</s><s>first step: following the instructions as per the adobe page http://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/kb/pantone-plus.htm for replacing the colour books.</s><s> make sure you follow all of the instructions for defaulting the setting in illustrator cs6 to use only cmyk breakdowns (this is very very important) this will fix your problem in illustrator however you will still notice that importing any artwork into indesign, the pantone colours will still load as lab versions (despite having deleted the pantone+ swatches from your library) 
</s><s>note: you will find that if you load old artwork files it will load your desired cmyk versions of any pantones correctly.</s><s> however when you add new swatches it loads these as lab breakdowns.</s><s> which is what we all want to go away to provide consistency with previous clients.</s><s> 
</s><s>important info: once a correct cmyk verions of a pantone has be imported into an indesign document you cannot load the same pantone reference colour again.</s><s> meanding it is impossible to have a pantone 282 c (cmyk) and pantone 282 c (lab)... only one colour profile can be in a document.</s><s> so basically if you pre-load all of the pantones as cmyk, indesign is prohibited from stupidly loading lab values of pantones swatches: 
so..... 
</s><s>step two: (ensuring you have defaulted illustrator in step1 correctly as per instructions from adobe)... open illutrator cs6.</s><s> create a new document.</s><s> click your swatches tab and clear it of all swatches so it is empty.</s><s> click open swatch library. click colour books.</s><s> navigate to the swatch library you require, (for me a mainly use pantone solid coated) not pantone+ ) however since you have followed the steps in step 1 these will not appear in your list as you have deleted all of the pantone + library.</s><s> ( you can repeat this for as many colour books as required.</s><s> when the swatched table opens, click the first swatch colour, hold shift key and the click the very last swatch colour and drag these into your swatch panel.</s><s> your will now have the complete colour book all defined as pantone/spot colour/ with a correct(traditional) cmyk value.</s><s> now go to "save swatch library as ase..."within the swatch dropdown menu.</s><s> and save this somewhere permanent. 
</s><s>step three: open indesign cs6.</s><s> do not open a document.</s><s> go to your swatches tab.</s><s> click 'load swatches' and open your saved ase file you made in illustraor cs6.</s><s> this will now load the full pantone colour library into your swatches tab.</s><s> remember as we said before that indesign will not allow you to open two versions of the same pnatone reference, so no matter what file you open, as long as it has a pantone reference, lab or cmyk versions, because they are now already loaded into the swatch library, indesign will force the conversion to only be cmyk values of your required pantone references and it will not default to lab values for pantone colours. 
</s><s>if required.</s><s> when you have finished your artwork, select, "select all unused" and then delete the ones you don't need. 
</s><s>warning: if you delete anything you have imported into your swatch library from your created ase file... i.e.</s><s> pantone 282c.... when you manually add it back again inside indesign it will default back to the undesired lab breakdown of the pantone. 
</s><s>hopefully this cures a few headaches, so you can all get back to work and enjoy what are some great benefits of using cs6 versions. 
</s><s>on my final note, i do understand why adobe is trying to force this change.</s><s> it is an improvement.</s><s> however it does require that everyone in your company follows suit, it also requires that you explain this to each of your clients and it does mean changing colours and work flows, which is a decision of individual companies not the decision of adobe to make it for you, which i think is a bad move on there part to try and force this change.

<s>i've read through this entire post and if anyone has to go through this much effort to maintain color consistancy after an application upgrade then it's pretty pretentious for adobe or pantone to want us to use their products.</s><s> it is a matter of opinion as to whether lab manages colors better than spot or cmyk, that is up to the user workflow and the options should have been left open, or (and maybe i missed it) adobe could have announced pantone was changing its library color build.</s><s> either way it is a huge burden on the users that support these products.</s><s> at any rate...</s><s> i immedietely noticed the change in the cmyk build in the pantone libraries from cs5 to cs6, and even though my rip is set up to manage the final output for select spot colors my print operators noticed the color variation on their screen and began qc'ing all the art.</s><s> the only way i've found to fix it is to go into the swatch library and manually change the spot colors back to the original build.</s><s> this will default an error on pre-flight but as long as you know you've creating the error you can just ignore it.</s><s> sure your rip can catch the color and convert it to the correct usable workspace.</s><s> but anyone in this business knows how much time it take to color calibrate these machines and expecting anyone has the time to do this in the middle of running a print business hasn't spent enough time on the ground to understand that's just stupid.</s><s> i don't want to have to set up a beta workstation to test adobe products for potential workflow errors on future version releases, but thats better than shutting down a print facility and wasting material trying to catch up to something that probably didn't need changed...just saying.

<s>hello john,

<s>hi guys, 
</s><s>i've read through this whole forum and i have found a solution to everyones problem.</s><s> it is a work around but will save everyone alot of time and hassle and so far it hasn't let me down. 
</s><s>first step: following the instructions as per the adobe page http://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/kb/pantone-plus.htm for replacing the colour books.</s><s> make sure you follow all of the instructions for defaulting the setting in illustrator cs6 to use only cmyk breakdowns (this is very very important) this will fix your problem in illustrator however you will still notice that importing any artwork into indesign, the pantone colours will still load as lab versions (despite having deleted the pantone+ swatches from your library) 
</s><s>note: you will find that if you load old artwork files it will load your desired cmyk versions of any pantones correctly.</s><s> however when you add new swatches it loads these as lab breakdowns.</s><s> which is what we all want to go away to provide consistency with previous clients.</s><s> 
</s><s>important info: once a correct cmyk verions of a pantone has be imported into an indesign document you cannot load the same pantone reference colour again.</s><s> meanding it is impossible to have a pantone 282 c (cmyk) and pantone 282 c (lab)... only one colour profile can be in a document.</s><s> so basically if you pre-load all of the pantones as cmyk, indesign is prohibited from stupidly loading lab values of pantones swatches: 
so..... 
</s><s>step two: (ensuring you have defaulted illustrator in step1 correctly as per instructions from adobe)... open illutrator cs6.</s><s> create a new document.</s><s> click your swatches tab and clear it of all swatches so it is empty.</s><s> click open swatch library. click colour books.</s><s> navigate to the swatch library you require, (for me a mainly use pantone solid coated) not pantone+ ) however since you have followed the steps in step 1 these will not appear in your list as you have deleted all of the pantone + library.</s><s> ( you can repeat this for as many colour books as required.</s><s> when the swatched table opens, click the first swatch colour, hold shift key and the click the very last swatch colour and drag these into your swatch panel.</s><s> your will now have the complete colour book all defined as pantone/spot colour/ with a correct(traditional) cmyk value.</s><s> now go to "save swatch library as ase..."within the swatch dropdown menu.</s><s> and save this somewhere permanent. 
</s><s>step three: open indesign cs6.</s><s> do not open a document.</s><s> go to your swatches tab.</s><s> click 'load swatches' and open your saved ase file you made in illustraor cs6.</s><s> this will now load the full pantone colour library into your swatches tab.</s><s> remember as we said before that indesign will not allow you to open two versions of the same pnatone reference, so no matter what file you open, as long as it has a pantone reference, lab or cmyk versions, because they are now already loaded into the swatch library, indesign will force the conversion to only be cmyk values of your required pantone references and it will not default to lab values for pantone colours. 
</s><s>if required.</s><s> when you have finished your artwork, select, "select all unused" and then delete the ones you don't need. 
</s><s>warning: if you delete anything you have imported into your swatch library from your created ase file... i.e.</s><s> pantone 282c.... when you manually add it back again inside indesign it will default back to the undesired lab breakdown of the pantone. 
</s><s>hopefully this cures a few headaches, so you can all get back to work and enjoy what are some great benefits of using cs6 versions. 
</s><s>on my final note, i do understand why adobe is trying to force this change.</s><s> it is an improvement.</s><s> however it does require that everyone in your company follows suit, it also requires that you explain this to each of your clients and it does mean changing colours and work flows, which is a decision of individual companies not the decision of adobe to make it for you, which i think is a bad move on there part to try and force this change.

<s>i've read through this entire post and if anyone has to go through this much effort to maintain color consistancy after an application upgrade then it's pretty pretentious for adobe or pantone to want us to use their products.</s><s> it is a matter of opinion as to whether lab manages colors better than spot or cmyk, that is up to the user workflow and the options should have been left open, or (and maybe i missed it) adobe could have announced pantone was changing its library color build.</s><s> either way it is a huge burden on the users that support these products.</s><s> at any rate...</s><s> i immedietely noticed the change in the cmyk build in the pantone libraries from cs5 to cs6, and even though my rip is set up to manage the final output for select spot colors my print operators noticed the color variation on their screen and began qc'ing all the art.</s><s> the only way i've found to fix it is to go into the swatch library and manually change the spot colors back to the original build.</s><s> this will default an error on pre-flight but as long as you know you've creating the error you can just ignore it.</s><s> sure your rip can catch the color and convert it to the correct usable workspace.</s><s> but anyone in this business knows how much time it take to color calibrate these machines and expecting anyone has the time to do this in the middle of running a print business hasn't spent enough time on the ground to understand that's just stupid.</s><s> i don't want to have to set up a beta workstation to test adobe products for potential workflow errors on future version releases, but thats better than shutting down a print facility and wasting material trying to catch up to something that probably didn't need changed...just saying.

<s>guys we have had the same problem (colour shifting) with our large format printer.</s><s> however, adobe has addressed the issue by changing the colour books as follows.</s><s> it does not change spot to lab, it keeps it as cmyk value as it was in cs5.

<s>here's the workaround i used from http://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/kb/pantone-plus.html <quote>
<s>workaround 1: replace pantone plus with older pantone color books adobe indesign cs6: + quit the application + from the folder adobe indesign cs6/presets/swatch libraries/, remove all the libraries that have names starting with pantone+ + from any older version of adobe indesign (cs2 - cs5) copy all the pantone libraries with extension .acb and place into: adobe indesign cs6/presets/swatch libraries/ + similarly, copy all pantone libraries with extension .acbl and place into: adobe indesign cs6/presets/swatch libraries/legacy/ + restart your application

</s><s>my original, desired color libraries have returned, but now i have two new problems: 
1.</s><s> the colors, while displaying in indesign the way i want them to, are now inexplicably exporting improperly (see fig.1: indesign layout on top, pdf export below -- even the letters set to paper [white] are incorrect). 

<quote>
<s>fig.1 

</s></quote>

2.</s><s> also, the swatch libraries are now duplicating every time i launch indesign (fig.2), even though there are only two main swatch libraries (fig.3), plus the legacy folder.

</s><s>fig.3

i don't know how to resolve either of these problems, which are road blocks to all of my current projects.

<s>i've figured out the solution to problem no.</s><s> 1: 
</s><s>launch indesign cs4 (if you still have it, like i do) and save the color settings (edit menu).</s><s> load those settings in indesign cs6 and your ability to export should be corrected and operate as it used to.</s><s> (this is what worked for me.</s><s>) 
</s><s>however, i still have no idea how to stop the color swatch libraries from duplicating every time i create a new color swatch.</s><s> i am up to eight copies appearing in the list now, even though there are still only two libraries in the cs6 folder.
