<s>hello, as with others on this forum, my company and i have had our fair share of hiccups with adobe connect.</s><s> i have tried to alieviate some of these by creating a checklist of tasks to preform before starting a meeting or webinar.</s><s> i am posting this here to see if any of you have more ideas/suggestions/critiques for the list.</s><s> it has recently been created so updates/edits will come regularly (also the list hasnt been organized properly yet so excuse that).</s><s> i hope this collaboration helps others as well as gives me some feedback to help us. thanks for contributing! 
</s><s>here is what i have so far: 
suggestions for an ideal attendee experience: verify connection speed attendee connection test - (http://admin.adobeconnect.com/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm# content) verify flash player is up to date flash player test - (http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/find-version-flash-player.html) close all applications (especially ones that compete for bandwidth like, browser, email, etc.</s><s>) do not use google chrome hardwire your network connection with an ethernet cable, do not use wifi turn off any virus scanning software or any firewalls 
precourse checklist for host/presenter: set meeting room bandwidth to "cable/dsl" change local storage limit.</s><s> right click/settings/local storage (the picture of a file)/slide bar to unlimited configure audio/video close all applications (especially ones that compete for bandwidth like: internet browser, email, etc.</s><s>) reboot computer do not use google chrome hardwire your network connection with an ethernet cable, no wifi turn off any virus scanning software or any firewalls make sure computer is plugged into power (weve had the host computer battery die and it was traumatic)
