<s>tammy is using a shape button to return to the last visited slide, and that may be a little bit too complicated for you as a real newbie.</s><s> and beware: i'm the biggest fan of shape buttons in the captivate community, have been blogging about them, giving presentations, webinars....</s><s> hope tammy is not insulted if i offer another workflow, more close to yours: you used the highlight dropdown list to jump to a specific slide, but the command to go to the last visited slide is not available in that dropdown list with commands. 
</s><s>you'll find similar dropdown lists in the actions accordion of the properties whenever there is an 'event' that can trigger a command, an action like 'jump to slide'.</s><s> in reality the work flow you found (which is recent), is a shortened version: the word you selected to act as a hyperlink, will be turned into a clickable (interactive) object that can trigger a command.</s><s> you don't have to know that really, but if you want more commands in your files, you'll have to learn about the events that are available for all interactive objects: buttons, click boxes, shape buttons (which tammy used), text entry boxes and interactive widgets.</s><s> this will be a bit overwhelming, but if you want to learn more about events, you can look at: http://blog.lilybiri.com/events-and-advanced-actions which has a link to an overview table. 
</s><s>do you want a similar solution as you created with the hyperlink?</s><s> try this: insert a click box over the word you want to use to get back to the last visited slide (in the vertical toolbox left, click box is just above the button tool with ok), you can resize it so that it fits nicely over the word that click box will automatically pause at the end of its timeline (look in the timeline panel), but is invisible to the user in the published file, you can - if you want - underline the word to make it look like a hyperlink you can delete the captions or uncheck them in the options accordion of the properties panel of the click box look for the action accordion in the properties panel (right dock) of the click box (has to be selected): if you leave attempts to infinite there is only one dropdown list for 'on success' open that list and choose 'go to the slide last visited' 

</s><s>beware not to get into a loop if you do the same on the first slide.</s><s> tammy without any doubt proposed the shape button because you can use it on a master slide, or time it for the rest of the project.</s><s> a click box cannot be used on a master slide, nor timed for the rest of the project.

<s>tammy is using a shape button to return to the last visited slide, and that may be a little bit too complicated for you as a real newbie.</s><s> and beware: i'm the biggest fan of shape buttons in the captivate community, have been blogging about them, giving presentations, webinars....</s><s> hope tammy is not insulted if i offer another workflow, more close to yours: you used the highlight dropdown list to jump to a specific slide, but the command to go to the last visited slide is not available in that dropdown list with commands. 
</s><s>you'll find similar dropdown lists in the actions accordion of the properties whenever there is an 'event' that can trigger a command, an action like 'jump to slide'.</s><s> in reality the work flow you found (which is recent), is a shortened version: the word you selected to act as a hyperlink, will be turned into a clickable (interactive) object that can trigger a command.</s><s> you don't have to know that really, but if you want more commands in your files, you'll have to learn about the events that are available for all interactive objects: buttons, click boxes, shape buttons (which tammy used), text entry boxes and interactive widgets.</s><s> this will be a bit overwhelming, but if you want to learn more about events, you can look at: http://blog.lilybiri.com/events-and-advanced-actions which has a link to an overview table. 
</s><s>do you want a similar solution as you created with the hyperlink?</s><s> try this: insert a click box over the word you want to use to get back to the last visited slide (in the vertical toolbox left, click box is just above the button tool with ok), you can resize it so that it fits nicely over the word that click box will automatically pause at the end of its timeline (look in the timeline panel), but is invisible to the user in the published file, you can - if you want - underline the word to make it look like a hyperlink you can delete the captions or uncheck them in the options accordion of the properties panel of the click box look for the action accordion in the properties panel (right dock) of the click box (has to be selected): if you leave attempts to infinite there is only one dropdown list for 'on success' open that list and choose 'go to the slide last visited' 

</s><s>beware not to get into a loop if you do the same on the first slide.</s><s> tammy without any doubt proposed the shape button because you can use it on a master slide, or time it for the rest of the project.</s><s> a click box cannot be used on a master slide, nor timed for the rest of the project.

<s>here's a shot of the intiial screen: 

</s><s>as you can see, there are multiple correct combinations of answers.</s><s> (users will be children, so it does need to be very user-friendly with the ability to undo/reset answers.</s><s>) in the word bank are 3 correct variable items and 6 correct values (i have it set so that only correct combinations of variables and values will be accepted as correct, so "lemonade" will never be a correct value for "age of seller", for example). 
</s><s>here's the next screen which i have made fill from selections from previous via an "on accept" advanced action (show a text caption unique to that answer and location): 

</s><s>the problem with this advanced action solution is that if the user makes a selection in the first screen, then gets it partially wrong or for some other reason resets the words back to the bank, those text captions on the next screen still have been shown and will stick around, thus:

i am about to throw in the towel here and just have students type in words to text boxes (these are mainly disadvantaged students i work with, so their typing skills are not great) just to utilize being able to make a user-generated variable out of text box entries.

<s>i'm working on a project in captivate 7 where the user is filling out a table (1 row, 3 columns, 9 possible correct answer combinations) using drag and drop words.</s><s> the user will ultimately build a table with 3 rows and 3 columns, doing 1 row at a time per screen.</s><s> i would like the user's correct answers to the rows they have already completed correctly to appear on each successive screen (but not for the entire rest of the project, just the following few screens).</s><s> i have tried to get this working every which way and i can't seem to make it happen. 
</s><s>the closest i have gotten is to use the "accept" panel to set each correct answer to assign its own value to a variable placed in a text caption on the following slide.</s><s> however, that seems to trigger an auto-submit (i have the global "auto submit correct answers" turned off) so that the first item the user places correctly in the table advances them to the next slide even though there are still 2 more cells of the table to complete.

<s>the problem seems to be that there's no way to tell captivate "on success" which of the several possible correct answers the user has chosen. it knows what is either correct, or incorrect, but beyond that the program doesn't have a way of specifying which exact correct answers the user has chosen.</s><s> and unlike, say, the dropdown menu wigit, there does't seem to be a way of assigning the drop down interaction with user-defined variables.</s><s> at least not that i have found.</s><s> the drop target remains a blank smartshape and the drag sources remain several text captions on the page, and captivate doesn't care what the user sticks where as long as it meets the "correct" criteria that i have assigned it.

<s>here's a shot of the intiial screen: 

</s><s>as you can see, there are multiple correct combinations of answers.</s><s> (users will be children, so it does need to be very user-friendly with the ability to undo/reset answers.</s><s>) in the word bank are 3 correct variable items and 6 correct values (i have it set so that only correct combinations of variables and values will be accepted as correct, so "lemonade" will never be a correct value for "age of seller", for example). 
</s><s>here's the next screen which i have made fill from selections from previous via an "on accept" advanced action (show a text caption unique to that answer and location): 

</s><s>the problem with this advanced action solution is that if the user makes a selection in the first screen, then gets it partially wrong or for some other reason resets the words back to the bank, those text captions on the next screen still have been shown and will stick around, thus: 


</s><s>every solution i've attempted has had some fatal flaw in the end.</s><s> what i really need to happen is a conditional action that basically says "if the contents of drop target x = drag source y, then set vara [on screen 2] to $text$." for example, "if the contents of drop target [variables cell] = text caption timeofday, then set $var1$ to "time of day". 
i am about to throw in the towel here and just have students type in words to text boxes (these are mainly disadvantaged students i work with, so their typing skills are not great) just to utilize being able to make a user-generated variable out of text box entries.

<s>right, yeah.</s><s> the fully complete table will have 3 rows (each screen adds one more row--and i have just realized that in my panic i miscalculated number of correct answers, there are fewer than i thought, though i don't think that makes a big difference to my issue), so after 3 slides, the user will have a table that looks like this: 

</s><s>the order that they put in the values of each row doesn't matter.</s><s> it could be drink, then age of seller, then time of day; or it could be time of day, then drink, then age of seller.</s><s> just as long as all the variables are in the "variables" column (this exercise is to teach controlled experimental design), and all the values are correctly placed in the "stand a" and "stand b" columns in order to describe the pictures seen to the left. 
</s><s>it seems like such a simple thing, yet i am utterly baffled.</s><s> this is my first time using the drag and drop interaction and it seems to behave really differently from other interactions.</s><s> i appreciate your time and expertise.

<subject>Captivate 7 tabbing problem</subject>
<post author="rosm2004" timestamp="Jul 25, 2013 10:59 AM">
<s>i am creating a presentation which is to be published on the desire2learn lms in scorm 1.2 format.. 
</s><s>most slides have audio voiceover with closed captioning.</s><s> some slides also have inserted video, also with closed captioning. 
i have created navigation buttons exit, replay slide, back, and next so the user has control of each slide.</s><s> i am also using playback controls - play/pause, progress bar, mute, and close captioning to control the audio and video. 
i work for a government agency and the presentation must be 508-compliant, which means that all navigation must be keyboard accessible.</s><s> you must be able to tab to each control and press enter to activate it. 
</s><s>the tabbing has always worked fine in preview mode.</s><s> however, when i publish it and run it in the browser, the tabbing works okay on all slides except the one that opens with the video.</s><s> then the tabbing stays up in the window menubar area and the focus will not shift to the presentation window until the video is over.

<s>hi there

<s>i am creating a software simulation in captivate 7. when i publish my video as an mp4 and then proceed to view my video, random places throughout the video are missing audio and sometimes a black or red block will appear in a frame for a second.</s><s> i noticed that if i delete the mp4 video file and re-publish the software simulation, that it will change and the audio will then be missing in other areas of the video.</s><s> the colored blocks do not show in every video, i've only seen them twice out of all of the publishing i've done so far.</s><s> does someone have any insight into why this is happening?
