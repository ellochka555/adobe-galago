<subject>Khmer Unicode 2.0 font conflict with Adobe suite</subject>

<s>i just downloaded khmer unicode 2.0. after i did, the microsoft word doc that supplied a khmer translation read correctly.</s><s> when i tried to copy and paste the khmer into any adobe apps (i tried 3, so have concluded it will be true of all) the font moved the letters around, deleted vowels, and generally messed up the phrases.</s><s> it did it the same way every time i tried new things. 
i even tried copying the font into the adobe font folder, and that didn't make any difference.</s><s> what could be creating this problem...</s><s> i need to resolve it right away since i am trying to finish a project by the end of today. 
i have 3 files to send someone, but don't see an option to attach them here i am using windows xp and adobe suite cs3

you should already know the answer to this.</s><s> btw it's not just khmer, it's any unicode encoded text. 
first the usual suspects: what db driver?</s><s> 100% sure you're using the correct dsn? 
then this caught my eye: set khmerreadwritetest ='#form.text#'
