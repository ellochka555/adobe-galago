<s>i've been having a related issue where opening a large fla (about 100m) crashes flash constantly on a brand new out the box imac that has plenty of juice to run the program and all the appropriate updates. after two days i ran across this gem. not sure how old it is but regardless: http://helpx.adobe.com/flash/kb/mountain-lion-support-flash-profession al.html 
mac os x 10.8 (mountain lion) is not supported with flash professional cs6.</s><s> the platform has not been tested with flash.</s><s> therefore, adobe recommends that you do not install flash professional cs6 on it.</s><s> you could encounter any of the following issues if you run flash cs6 on mac os x 10.8: the color picker displays incorrect colors.</s><s> flash professional cs6 crashes when you use the keyboard shortcut (command + option + s) for scale and rotate.</s><s> you cannot open large fla files.</s><s> the stage and timeline are slow. not sure what could be going on if you're not running mountain lion, but it might save you some time.</s><s> i'm not even sure why they offer flash cs6 for os x without putting this warning right up front. it would seem like something a consumer would want to know before purchasing a product that is not recommended to be run on your system. hopefully they find a fix for this soon. not sure what's causing the subselection tool control point crash, but i would imagine it's related to the fact that apparently flash cs6 isn't supposed to be run on mountain lion at all. dunno if this is useful to everyone on this thread, but i lost a few days of work trying to get cs6 up and running on mountain lion before i came across this and now, unfortunately, i've just had to go back to my old hardware until adobe decides to find a fix for mountain lion (or apple finds a fix for flash cs6, who knows what the issue is).

<s>problem is also that cs6 is the last version of adobe's tools which does not require a monthly fee.

</s><s>at first i was quite sad that flash was bit the dust in favour of the (at that time) much less powerful html5, but now the cc-subscription and the alternative tools/frameworks you can buy for a single (or few) months cc subscription fee makes me switch even faster.

<s>i've been having a related issue where opening a large fla (about 100m) crashes flash constantly on a brand new out the box imac that has plenty of juice to run the program and all the appropriate updates. after two days i ran across this gem. not sure how old it is but regardless: http://helpx.adobe.com/flash/kb/mountain-lion-support-flash-profession al.html 
mac os x 10.8 (mountain lion) is not supported with flash professional cs6.</s><s> the platform has not been tested with flash.</s><s> therefore, adobe recommends that you do not install flash professional cs6 on it.</s><s> you could encounter any of the following issues if you run flash cs6 on mac os x 10.8: the color picker displays incorrect colors.</s><s> flash professional cs6 crashes when you use the keyboard shortcut (command + option + s) for scale and rotate.</s><s> you cannot open large fla files.</s><s> the stage and timeline are slow. not sure what could be going on if you're not running mountain lion, but it might save you some time.</s><s> i'm not even sure why they offer flash cs6 for os x without putting this warning right up front. it would seem like something a consumer would want to know before purchasing a product that is not recommended to be run on your system. hopefully they find a fix for this soon. not sure what's causing the subselection tool control point crash, but i would imagine it's related to the fact that apparently flash cs6 isn't supposed to be run on mountain lion at all. dunno if this is useful to everyone on this thread, but i lost a few days of work trying to get cs6 up and running on mountain lion before i came across this and now, unfortunately, i've just had to go back to my old hardware until adobe decides to find a fix for mountain lion (or apple finds a fix for flash cs6, who knows what the issue is).
