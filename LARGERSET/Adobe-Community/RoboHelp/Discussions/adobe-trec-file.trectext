can you clarify what you mean by "i open the project from our shared location, and it downloads the current project files to my local machine.".</s><s> it almost sounds like you are using some sort of source control?</s><s> if that's the case, perhaps your source control has some files locked that robohelp is needing in order to work.

<s>hi there 
can you clarify what you mean by "i open the project from our shared location, and it downloads the current project files to my local machine.".</s><s> it almost sounds like you are using some sort of source control?</s><s> if that's the case, perhaps your source control has some files locked that robohelp is needing in order to work. 
i might be tempted to just create a new blank project and see if things work.</s><s> that would ensure robohelp has been installed and is working properly.</s><s> after that, you could then import the topics from the former project in order to create the new one.

<s>to clarify paula's answer, the sync feature is not intended to allow multiple authors to work on the same project at the same time, it is about sharing specific topics and other resources. 
</s><s>dropbox and other cloud based shares can be used but you have to start outside rh by copying the whole project into dropbox.</s><s> then each author will effectively have a local copy.</s><s> before starting work, they must ensure dropbox is synced or they could be working on out of date files. 
</s><s>the danger is that two authors would both open the same topic or make a change that impacts a shared file, such as the toc or index.</s><s> syncing does not replace source control.</s><s> if you can be certain two authors will not work simultaneously on a project and will check dropbox is synced before starting work, then it is ok to work this way.</s><s> i am uk based and worked successfully this way with someone us based. 
</s><s>if you copy whole folders to the cloud from inside rh, you will likely find that dependant resources in other are not placed in the same folder as in rh. 
</s><s>with single topics and other resources these are not issues as rh was designed to deal with that.

<subject>Can I delete multiple topics in RH10 without deleting links to the deleted topic?</subject>
<post author="Paula%20Stern" timestamp="Mar 17, 2014 6:22 AM">
<s>okay - one question further...why do you need to split them into individual projects.</s><s> as robohelp gets more robust, i find that i am joining projects together to minimize repeated text.</s><s> using conditional tags, i can generate numerous smaller documents and still save on content reuse. 
</s><s>if there is any chance in the future of needing to "share" some of the info, i'd go with heavy use of conditional tags over breaking them into smaller topics.</s><s> with conditional tags, you only "ship" the files you need anyway, so the fact that they are contained within a larger problem is no longer a major issue.

<s>to all above - in my case, the topic set to be deleted is reference material that has been historically maintained both in the webhelp project and in an fm book, but not with single sourcing into the webhelp project.</s><s> duplicated effort.</s><s> the webhelp project is a huge, flat legacy structure that covers many products so i was hoping to avoid introducing single sourcing for just the reference piece.</s><s> i'd hoped to just produce a tagged pdf and change the original links to point to that.</s><s> a separate issue is making that a non-option though; i can't get the successive links to the pdf to open to the topic except in firefox.</s><s> ideally this project would be rebuilt as a merged webhelp but our project lifecycles are so short that this may not be feasible.</s><s> the ideas here have been helpful though.

<s>to clarify paula's answer, the sync feature is not intended to allow multiple authors to work on the same project at the same time, it is about sharing specific topics and other resources. 
</s><s>dropbox and other cloud based shares can be used but you have to start outside rh by copying the whole project into dropbox.</s><s> then each author will effectively have a local copy.</s><s> before starting work, they must ensure dropbox is synced or they could be working on out of date files. 
</s><s>the danger is that two authors would both open the same topic or make a change that impacts a shared file, such as the toc or index.</s><s> syncing does not replace source control.</s><s> if you can be certain two authors will not work simultaneously on a project and will check dropbox is synced before starting work, then it is ok to work this way.</s><s> i am uk based and worked successfully this way with someone us based. 
</s><s>if you copy whole folders to the cloud from inside rh, you will likely find that dependant resources in other are not placed in the same folder as in rh. 
</s><s>with single topics and other resources these are not issues as rh was designed to deal with that.

<s>when you generate a pdf, rh creates a word document behind the scenes so it should work.</s><s> perhaps that process uses the doc format.</s><s> generate both using the docx format and see if it works.
