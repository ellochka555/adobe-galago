<subject>NVidia GPU-accelerated H264-encoder plugin, ready for public testing</subject>
<post author="nvenc4everyone" timestamp="Jun 27, 2013 11:39 PM">
<s>hi all, 
</s><s>i have written a 'proof-of-concept' gpu-accelerated h264-encoder for adobe media encoder (cs6).</s><s> it requires an nvidia 6xx/7xx series "kepler" gpu (cuda capability 3.0), and uses the dedicated gpu's builtin hardware-encoder (nvenc) to offload the h264-encoding process from the host-cpu.</s><s> this software is "proof-of-concept", so it's missing some critical features (no interlaced-video support, no aac-audio or dolby ac-3 audio), and of course, it could be buggy!</s><s> but it's free. 
!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s> disclaimer: nvenc-export is third-party software that is not supported by either adobe or nvidia.</s><s> it comes with no warranty -- use at your own risk. 
</s><s>software/hardware requirements: 
</s><s>(1)adobe premiere pro cs6 or media encoder cs6 (windows version) sorry, macosx is not supported.</s><s> (nvidia nvenc sdk doesn't support macosx.</s><s>) 
</s><s>(1)nvidia kepler gpu <gkxxx> with 1gb vram or more (gtx650 or above, gt650m or above) (sorry, nvidia fermi <gfxxx> is not supported, it doesn't have the nvenc hardware feature) note,if you have mpe-acceleration enabled, keep in mind the nvenc-plugin consumes some additional vram because it uses your gpu to perform h264-encoding.</s><s> strongly recommend a 2gb card 
(2) microsoft visual c++ 2010 sp1 x64 redistributables (download this from microsoft's website) 
</s><s>installation instructions: 
in adobe premiere pro cs6: (1) on your system, locate the installation-directory for premiere pro cs6.</s><s> usually, this is c:/program files/adobe/adobe premiere pro cs6 (2) copy the included file plug-ins/common/nvenc_export.prm to <installation dir>/plug-ins/common/ 
-> to choose the nvenc-plugin in premiere pro, in the format-menu, select <nvenc_export> 
</s><s>in adobe media encoder cs6: (1) on your system, locate the installation-directory for media encoder cs6.</s><s> usually, this is c:/program files/adobe/adobe media encoder cs6 (2) copy the included file plug-ins/common/nvenc_export.prm to <installation dir>/plug-ins/common/ 
-> to choose the nvenc-plugin in media encoder, in the format-menu, select <nvenc_export> 
</s><s>performance & quality notes: 
(1) how much faster is nvenc-export than adobe's built-in mainconcept h264 encoder? 
</s><s>depends on your pc system.</s><s> on my test-system, which is ordinary desktop pc with intel i5-3570k (4-core 3.4ghz), nvenc-plugin is roughly 4x faster than mainconcept.</s><s> on a dual-socket xeon ivy bridge-e system, nvenc would probably only be 2x faster (in media encoder.</s><s>) 
</s><s>(2)how does the video-quality compare? 
</s><s>comparing similar settings/video-bitrate, mainconcept performs better at lower-bitrates(less artifacts).</s><s> at medium-high bitrates, nvenc is comparable to mainconcept. 
(3) how does nvenc-export encode the video?</s><s> the plugin fetches videoframes from the adobe application, then converts the frames from yuv420 to nv12 surface-format (using host-cpu.</s><s>) then it passes the converted frames to the nvenc front-end.</s><s> from here, nvenc hardware takes over, and handles all aspects of the video compression.</s><s> when nvenc hardware is done, it calls the plugin to output write the elementary bitstream (to the selected filepath.</s><s>) nvenc-hardware does not encode audio, nor does not multiplex the a/vbitstreams -- this is still done in software (on the host-cpu) 
</s><s>the nvenc hardware block has very little cpu-overhead.</s><s> but since video-encoding is just 1 step in the entire adobe rendering path, cpu-usage will likely still be quite high when using nvenc-plugin. 
(4) what's the maximum-size video nvenc-export can handle?</s><s> h264 high-profile @ level 5.1, which works out to roughly 3840x2160 @ 30fps.</s><s> (note the actual encoding-speed will probably be less than 30fps.</s><s>) 
</s><s>(5) how fast is the nvenc-export hardware in kepler gpu?</s><s> assuming the adobe application host is infinitely fast (i.e. can send video to plugin in zero-time), nvenc-hardware will encode high-profile (cabac, 2 refframes, 1-bframe) 1920x1080p video @ ~100fps.</s><s> at 3840x2160p (4k video), the hardware encode-speed drops to roughly 20-25fps.</s><s> that is still faster than a desktop pc. 
</s><s>nvenc-speed is generally same across the kepler family - the high-end geforce gtx titan (or gtx780) is no faster than the entry-level geforce gtx650, because all kepler models share the same nvenc hardware-block, which is totally separate and independent of the gpu's 3d-graphics engine. 
</s><s>in premiere pro 6, mpe acceleration will greatly affect how quickly adobe can render video to the exporter.</s><s> so a more powerful kepler gpu will probalby complete projects faster than a less powerful one (up to nvenc's performance ceiling.</s><s>) for more info, please refer to nvidia's nvenc whitepaper at their developer website (public) 
(6) i have a multi-gpu setup, can i encode with multiple gpus?</s><s> no, nvenc targets and uses only a single physical gpu.</s><s> (you can choose which one.</s><s>) 
</s><s>known limitations and problems: 
nvenc-plugin is a 'proof-of-concept' program -- it is not a finished product.</s><s> so it's missing some features, and other things are known to be broken: 
interlaced video encdoing does not work at all (not supported in current consumer geforce drivers) 
</s><s>audio support is very limited: uncompressed pcm) no aac or dolby-digital 
multiplexer support is very limited: mpeg-2 ts only, using an included third-party tool tsmuxer.exe no mpeg-4 muxing (*.</s><s>mp4) 
</s><s>when the muxed mpeg-2 ts file in windows media player (wmp), there is no sound.</s><s> this is because wmp doesn't recognize pcm-audio in mpeg-2 ts files.</s><s> you have 2 choices; you can use a third-party media-player such as mpc-hc or vlc.</s><s> or you can postprocess the audio-wav file into a compatible format (dolby digital/ac-3) 
in the pop-up plugin user-interface, the <multiplexer> tab is missing or not shown properly.</s><s> (to fix: select a different codec, then re-select nvenc_export.</s><s>) 
</s><s>doesn't support older nvidia gpus (gtx5xx and older, gt630 and lower) sorry, nvenc hardware was introduced with nvidia's kepler family (2012) anything older than that will not work with the plugin.

<s>i don't have much more time to work on this project, so this will probably be the final release.   nvenc_export version v1.03 (august 17, 2013) is now available -   before, when the muxer was used (mp4 or mts), nvenc_export would create temporary file(s) with the same basename as the output file.  if the output directory happened to have a file with the same name as nvenc_export's temporary file(s), they were silently overwritten.  (for example: when expoting to "my_movie.mp4", nvenc_export would create "my_movie.m4a" and "my_movie.264"   now, nvenc_export chooses a temporary filename that is less likely to accidentally overwrite other files in the same directory: "my_movie_###.m4a" and "my_movie_###.264" (where ### is a random number.</s><s>)   nvenc_export is now compiled with microsoft visual studio 2012 and the nvidia cuda sdk 5.5.</s><s> (previous versions were compiled with vs2010sp1 and cuda sdk 5.0)  due to the switch to cuda 5.5, nvenc_export requires that you have a newer geforce gpu driver (may 2013 or newer.</s><s>)  if it's not already installed, you'll need to download and install visual c++ redistributables for visual studio 2012 update 3.   download link   nvenc_export version v1.03 (august 17, 2013) - https://docs.google.com/file/d/0b96crwknxmwdaxmtx0d3uhbqt1e/edit?usp=s haring when you click on the above link, it will open the contents of the zip-container (nvenc_export_v103.zip)  don't download the individual files, you'll want the whole zip file.   you will also need to downoad and install the following item from microsoft: "visual c++ redistributable for visual studio 2012 update 3"     third party tools:   (1) nvenc does not include built-in multiplexing.  if you wish to output *.</s><s>ts or *.</s><s>mp4 files, you must download and install the following third-party tools: tsmuxer.exe  (get it from http://www.videohelp.com/tools/tsmuxer) mp4box.exe    (get it from http://www.videohelp.com/tools/mp4box) (2) to enable aac-audio output, you must download and install neroaacenc.</s><s> go to http://www.nero.com, then use the website's search-feature to search for neroaacenc   known problems: (same limitations as previous versions.</s><s>)   (1) nvenc does not include built-in multiplexing.  if you wish to output *.</s><s>ts or *.</s><s>mp4 files, you must download the third-party tools mentioned above.   (2) nvenc does not support interlaced-video output.</s><s> if you attempt to output interlaced video, the plugin will either crash, or generate a corrupt video bitstream.   (3) nvenc does not support (ac3) dolby digital audio, only pcm.  (and aac, if you separately download and install neroaacenc.</s><s>)   (4) when outputing video level5 h264 video (i.e. video larger than 1920x1080), the bitrate-control modes don't work correctly, and will result in an abnormally small and bad looking video.  to workaround this, change the ratecontrol setting to rc_constqp   source code link this section is only for software-developers who are interested in recompiling nvenc_export.</s><s> the c++ source-code can be downloaded from the following link     nvenc_export version v1.03 src (august 17, 2013) - https://docs.google.com/file/d/0b96crwknxmwdbkywdkvenlbumdg/edit?usp=s haring   (nvenc_export is distributed under the lgpl license.</s><s>)   i must apologize for the condition of the source-code.  i'm not a professional software developer, so some dir/paths might not work correctly out-of-the-box.  you'll need to know your way around windows application development to fix some basic compile environment issues (for example, "d3dx9.h missing".</s><s>)   also, you will need the following items (not included in the above link) to recompile nvenc_export:   nvenc client license key license-key can only be purchased from nvidia, it is not included in the above link.  (you can re-compile nvenc_export without the client-key, but the plugin won't encode any video because nvidia requires the client-key to unlock the driver's nvenc api.</s><s>) microsoft visual studio 2012 pro (with update 3) this can be downloaded for free, through microsoft's "websitespark" program.   microsoft directx sdk (june 2010) download it from microsoft   nvidia cuda 5.5 sdk download it from nvidia   nvidia nvenc 2.0 sdk download it from nvidia   adobe premiere cs6 sdk download it from adobe

<s>jakub,

<s>hi all, 
</s><s>i have written a 'proof-of-concept' gpu-accelerated h264-encoder for adobe media encoder (cs6).</s><s> it requires an nvidia 6xx/7xx series "kepler" gpu (cuda capability 3.0), and uses the dedicated gpu's builtin hardware-encoder (nvenc) to offload the h264-encoding process from the host-cpu.</s><s> this software is "proof-of-concept", so it's missing some critical features (no interlaced-video support, no aac-audio or dolby ac-3 audio), and of course, it could be buggy!</s><s> but it's free. 
!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s> disclaimer: nvenc-export is third-party software that is not supported by either adobe or nvidia.</s><s> it comes with no warranty -- use at your own risk. 
</s><s>software/hardware requirements: 
</s><s>(1)adobe premiere pro cs6 or media encoder cs6 (windows version) sorry, macosx is not supported.</s><s> (nvidia nvenc sdk doesn't support macosx.</s><s>) 
</s><s>(1)nvidia kepler gpu <gkxxx> with 1gb vram or more (gtx650 or above, gt650m or above) (sorry, nvidia fermi <gfxxx> is not supported, it doesn't have the nvenc hardware feature) note,if you have mpe-acceleration enabled, keep in mind the nvenc-plugin consumes some additional vram because it uses your gpu to perform h264-encoding.</s><s> strongly recommend a 2gb card 
(2) microsoft visual c++ 2010 sp1 x64 redistributables (download this from microsoft's website) 
</s><s>installation instructions: 
in adobe premiere pro cs6: (1) on your system, locate the installation-directory for premiere pro cs6.</s><s> usually, this is c:/program files/adobe/adobe premiere pro cs6 (2) copy the included file plug-ins/common/nvenc_export.prm to <installation dir>/plug-ins/common/ 
-> to choose the nvenc-plugin in premiere pro, in the format-menu, select <nvenc_export> 
</s><s>in adobe media encoder cs6: (1) on your system, locate the installation-directory for media encoder cs6.</s><s> usually, this is c:/program files/adobe/adobe media encoder cs6 (2) copy the included file plug-ins/common/nvenc_export.prm to <installation dir>/plug-ins/common/ 
-> to choose the nvenc-plugin in media encoder, in the format-menu, select <nvenc_export> 
</s><s>performance & quality notes: 
(1) how much faster is nvenc-export than adobe's built-in mainconcept h264 encoder? 
</s><s>depends on your pc system.</s><s> on my test-system, which is ordinary desktop pc with intel i5-3570k (4-core 3.4ghz), nvenc-plugin is roughly 4x faster than mainconcept.</s><s> on a dual-socket xeon ivy bridge-e system, nvenc would probably only be 2x faster (in media encoder.</s><s>) 
</s><s>(2)how does the video-quality compare? 
</s><s>comparing similar settings/video-bitrate, mainconcept performs better at lower-bitrates(less artifacts).</s><s> at medium-high bitrates, nvenc is comparable to mainconcept. 
(3) how does nvenc-export encode the video?</s><s> the plugin fetches videoframes from the adobe application, then converts the frames from yuv420 to nv12 surface-format (using host-cpu.</s><s>) then it passes the converted frames to the nvenc front-end.</s><s> from here, nvenc hardware takes over, and handles all aspects of the video compression.</s><s> when nvenc hardware is done, it calls the plugin to output write the elementary bitstream (to the selected filepath.</s><s>) nvenc-hardware does not encode audio, nor does not multiplex the a/vbitstreams -- this is still done in software (on the host-cpu) 
</s><s>the nvenc hardware block has very little cpu-overhead.</s><s> but since video-encoding is just 1 step in the entire adobe rendering path, cpu-usage will likely still be quite high when using nvenc-plugin. 
(4) what's the maximum-size video nvenc-export can handle?</s><s> h264 high-profile @ level 5.1, which works out to roughly 3840x2160 @ 30fps.</s><s> (note the actual encoding-speed will probably be less than 30fps.</s><s>) 
</s><s>(5) how fast is the nvenc-export hardware in kepler gpu?</s><s> assuming the adobe application host is infinitely fast (i.e. can send video to plugin in zero-time), nvenc-hardware will encode high-profile (cabac, 2 refframes, 1-bframe) 1920x1080p video @ ~100fps.</s><s> at 3840x2160p (4k video), the hardware encode-speed drops to roughly 20-25fps.</s><s> that is still faster than a desktop pc. 
</s><s>nvenc-speed is generally same across the kepler family - the high-end geforce gtx titan (or gtx780) is no faster than the entry-level geforce gtx650, because all kepler models share the same nvenc hardware-block, which is totally separate and independent of the gpu's 3d-graphics engine. 
</s><s>in premiere pro 6, mpe acceleration will greatly affect how quickly adobe can render video to the exporter.</s><s> so a more powerful kepler gpu will probalby complete projects faster than a less powerful one (up to nvenc's performance ceiling.</s><s>) for more info, please refer to nvidia's nvenc whitepaper at their developer website (public) 
(6) i have a multi-gpu setup, can i encode with multiple gpus?</s><s> no, nvenc targets and uses only a single physical gpu.</s><s> (you can choose which one.</s><s>) 
</s><s>known limitations and problems: 
nvenc-plugin is a 'proof-of-concept' program -- it is not a finished product.</s><s> so it's missing some features, and other things are known to be broken: 
interlaced video encdoing does not work at all (not supported in current consumer geforce drivers) 
</s><s>audio support is very limited: uncompressed pcm) no aac or dolby-digital 
multiplexer support is very limited: mpeg-2 ts only, using an included third-party tool tsmuxer.exe no mpeg-4 muxing (*.</s><s>mp4) 
</s><s>when the muxed mpeg-2 ts file in windows media player (wmp), there is no sound.</s><s> this is because wmp doesn't recognize pcm-audio in mpeg-2 ts files.</s><s> you have 2 choices; you can use a third-party media-player such as mpc-hc or vlc.</s><s> or you can postprocess the audio-wav file into a compatible format (dolby digital/ac-3) 
in the pop-up plugin user-interface, the <multiplexer> tab is missing or not shown properly.</s><s> (to fix: select a different codec, then re-select nvenc_export.</s><s>) 
</s><s>doesn't support older nvidia gpus (gtx5xx and older, gt630 and lower) sorry, nvenc hardware was introduced with nvidia's kepler family (2012) anything older than that will not work with the plugin.

<s>nvenc_export version v1.07 (mar 14, 2014) is now available -   [1.07] for systems with more than 1 nvidia gpu installed, fixed a very stupid bug in the gpu-selection control box.  nvenc_export always used the 1st detected nvidia gpu (gpuindex==0), regardless of the user's selection.  this is useful for systems with multiple types of nvidia cards, since you choose which gpu will run nvenc_export.  for instance, the geforce gtx750/750ti (gm107) is ~50% faster at h264-encode than the previous kepler generation (gk1xx).   also, the first frame of encoded h264 bitstreaam is now tagged with a debug-message; which is readable can be read/displayed from the third-party tool mediainfo.</s><s> the nvenc_export settings, nvenc_export version, and gpu device are reported in the message.   download link nvenc_export version v1.07 (mar 14, 2014) - https://googledrive.com/host/0b96crwknxmwdoddiq05qs1l0m0u/nvenc_export _v107.zip you will also need to download and install the following item from microsoft: "visual c++ redistributable for visual studio 2012 update 4"   installation tutorial: nvenc_export installation tutorial part 1/3: http://youtu.be/wprcq133ye0   third party tools:   (1) nvenc does not include built-in multiplexing.  if you wish to output *.</s><s>ts or *.</s><s>mp4 files, you must download and install the following third-party tools: tsmuxer.exe  (get it from http://www.videohelp.com/tools/tsmuxer) mp4box.exe    (get it from http://www.videohelp.com/tools/mp4box) (2) to enable aac-audio output, you must download and install neroaacenc.</s><s> go to http://www.nero.com, then use the website's search-feature to search for neroaacenc   known problems: (same limitations as previous versions.</s><s>)   (1) if mpe hardware-acceleration (cuda) is enabled in premiere pro or media encoder, then nvenc_export cannot resize the source-video to a different output-size.  you must make sure the source-video size and output-video size are the same, otherwise the video-encode will fail.  (alternatively, turn off mpe hardware-acceleration.</s><s>) i suspect this is caused by adobe's hardware mpe-renderer not supporting resize-operations on the prpixelformat_yuv_420_* surfaceformat, which is requested by nvenc_export.   (2) nvenc does not include built-in multiplexing.  if you wish to output *.</s><s>ts or *.</s><s>mp4 files, you must download the third-party tools mentioned above.   (3) if encoding to interlaced-video, you must set the field type to upper first.</s><s> other choices will cause the plugin to crash, or generate a bad (unusable) file.   (4) nvenc does not support (ac3) dolby digital audio, only pcm.  (if you separately download and install neroaacenc, then aac-audio is supported.</s><s>)   (5) when outputing video level5 h264 video (i.e. video larger than 1920x1080), the bitrate-control modes don't work correctly, and will result in an abnormally small and bad looking video.  to workaround this, change the ratecontrol setting to rc_constqp   source code link this section is only for software-developers who are interested in recompiling nvenc_export.</s><s> the c++ source-code can be downloaded from the following link     nvenc_export version v1.07 src (mar 14, 2014) - https://googledrive.com/host/0b96crwknxmwdoddiq05qs1l0m0u/nvenc_export _src_v107.zip (nvenc_export is distributed under the lgpl license.</s><s>)   i must apologize for the condition of the source-code.  i'm not a professional software developer, so some dir/paths might not work correctly out-of-the-box.  you'll need to know your way around windows application development to fix some basic compile environment issues (for example, "d3dx9.h missing".</s><s>)   also, you will need the following items (not included in the above link) to recompile nvenc_export:   *nvenc client license key [optional, only needed for geforce drivers older than whql 334.89] as of the geforce whql 334.89 driver releae (feb 2014), nvenc api is now open for all.  the client-key is only necessary if you want to access nvenc hardware on older geforce drivers (which still check for the key.</s><s>) microsoft visual studio 2012 pro (with update 4) this can be downloaded for free, through microsoft's "businesssitespark" or "dreamspark" program.</s><s> microsoft directx sdk (june 2010) download it from microsoft nvidia cuda 5.5, nvenc 3.0, and nvapi sdks download them from nvidia adobe premiere cs6 sdk download it from adobe

<s>emily, just noticed that you are outputting the render to the c: drive, not a good idea.</s><s> you always want a separate, fast, dedicated drive for video editing/encoding work.</s><s> windows and your other apps are keeping that system drive busy enough - trying to write massive amounts of data to it will only bog it down more.</s><s> also, if the target drive is getting full and/or fragmented, that can also increase render times.

<s>it almost killed me, i tell ya.</s><s> but i finally got it figured on this end.</s><s> i don't know if this will help you, emily,, but after the war i just waged, i gotta tell somebody. 
</s><s>okay, i uninstalled, and cleaned everything up - the cia would have been jealous of my deletion skills. 
i reinstalled only premiere, ae, and of course media encoder came a long for the ride, and stopped there - and tried again. 


</s><s>as you can see - it's only 1 minute long and i got it down to 23mb. 
</s><s>but then we give it to ole media encoder. 

20+ hours!</s><s> but that's still hd, so i scrubbed everything out and tried with the tinest, lowest rate encoding i could dig up. 


i don't know if y'all can see that down at the bottom - but i really did get it down to 2mb just for this experiment.</s><s> i happily clicked the button and got .... 




*head desk!* *head desk!* *head desk!* 
oh them's fighting words!</s><s> errr... numbers! 
</s><s>so, i started researching, overhauling, generally driving myself in circles.</s><s> now my video card is decent, but it's not cuda - but i discovered the card maker had a new driver out - it's beta, but fingers crossed. 
</s><s>it helped - doesn't have a lot of the bells and whistles, but i have a small but notable difference. 
</s><s>media encoder still crashes upon the second time i open it, or send anything to it, i have to reinstall from the patch file.</s><s> now this project i'm doing, i'm in a serious time crunch - so silly me thought it would be easier to get a template, and slap it together and go on down the road. 
i should have known better.</s><s> the first two templates i used, worked like a charm.</s><s> under an hour to render, and we zipped along just fine. 
</s><s>but now i realize i ow media encoder an apology.</s><s> not a big one - it's still giving me fits - but a little one. 
</s><s>it's the way the templates are set up.</s><s> it would have been faster for me just to build this stuff from the ground up.</s><s> i ended up ripping these suckers apart and putting them together in a much more efficient fashion. 
</s><s>i've never had this problem before, i never really looked that hard at this stuff.</s><s> when i did - i was really to kill someone. 
</s><s>so, i ended up stripping these things down, and really streamlining them.</s><s> i also started pre-rendering stuff. 
i pre-compose all the time, but really haven't messed with pre-rendering, i do short trailer stuffs. 
</s><s>but pre-rendering helped a ton too! 
i got that sucker lined out like you wouldn't believe! 
</s><s>and drum roll!</s><s>......</s><s> 







</s><s>41 hours 
well, since this wasn't working like i planned, i went back to ae and tried all sorts of different formats.</s><s> i couldn't figure out why it worked just great on my first two renders, and it wasn't working with these last two.all four templates are different. 
</s><s>then i realized it was because the last two were still awful despite me trying to fix them.</s><s> i went back to my original template which is about the same length, and it has trapcode - but i tossed something together with that. 


</s><s>and rendered in 20 min in ae. 
</s><s>media encoder and i still aren't speaking. 
i still haven't been able to get the second two templates to work - but i just got done rendering my project on the first template and it worked like a charm.</s><s> so that's when i decided to pop over here. 
</s><s>what exactly do you have going on, emily?</s><s> i'm wondering now if not only pre-composing, but pre-rendering as much as you can will help.</s><s> at least i hope it will! 
</s><s>it's either that or take a sledgehammer to it - which is still a possibility for me. hehe!

<s>emily, just noticed that you are outputting the render to the c: drive, not a good idea.</s><s> you always want a separate, fast, dedicated drive for video editing/encoding work.</s><s> windows and your other apps are keeping that system drive busy enough - trying to write massive amounts of data to it will only bog it down more.</s><s> also, if the target drive is getting full and/or fragmented, that can also increase render times.

<s>it almost killed me, i tell ya.</s><s> but i finally got it figured on this end.</s><s> i don't know if this will help you, emily,, but after the war i just waged, i gotta tell somebody. 
</s><s>okay, i uninstalled, and cleaned everything up - the cia would have been jealous of my deletion skills. 
i reinstalled only premiere, ae, and of course media encoder came a long for the ride, and stopped there - and tried again. 


</s><s>as you can see - it's only 1 minute long and i got it down to 23mb. 
</s><s>but then we give it to ole media encoder. 

20+ hours!</s><s> but that's still hd, so i scrubbed everything out and tried with the tinest, lowest rate encoding i could dig up. 


i don't know if y'all can see that down at the bottom - but i really did get it down to 2mb just for this experiment.</s><s> i happily clicked the button and got .... 




*head desk!* *head desk!* *head desk!* 
oh them's fighting words!</s><s> errr... numbers! 
</s><s>so, i started researching, overhauling, generally driving myself in circles.</s><s> now my video card is decent, but it's not cuda - but i discovered the card maker had a new driver out - it's beta, but fingers crossed. 
</s><s>it helped - doesn't have a lot of the bells and whistles, but i have a small but notable difference. 
</s><s>media encoder still crashes upon the second time i open it, or send anything to it, i have to reinstall from the patch file.</s><s> now this project i'm doing, i'm in a serious time crunch - so silly me thought it would be easier to get a template, and slap it together and go on down the road. 
i should have known better.</s><s> the first two templates i used, worked like a charm.</s><s> under an hour to render, and we zipped along just fine. 
</s><s>but now i realize i ow media encoder an apology.</s><s> not a big one - it's still giving me fits - but a little one. 
</s><s>it's the way the templates are set up.</s><s> it would have been faster for me just to build this stuff from the ground up.</s><s> i ended up ripping these suckers apart and putting them together in a much more efficient fashion. 
</s><s>i've never had this problem before, i never really looked that hard at this stuff.</s><s> when i did - i was really to kill someone. 
</s><s>so, i ended up stripping these things down, and really streamlining them.</s><s> i also started pre-rendering stuff. 
i pre-compose all the time, but really haven't messed with pre-rendering, i do short trailer stuffs. 
</s><s>but pre-rendering helped a ton too! 
i got that sucker lined out like you wouldn't believe! 
</s><s>and drum roll!</s><s>......</s><s> 







</s><s>41 hours 
well, since this wasn't working like i planned, i went back to ae and tried all sorts of different formats.</s><s> i couldn't figure out why it worked just great on my first two renders, and it wasn't working with these last two.all four templates are different. 
</s><s>then i realized it was because the last two were still awful despite me trying to fix them.</s><s> i went back to my original template which is about the same length, and it has trapcode - but i tossed something together with that. 


</s><s>and rendered in 20 min in ae. 
</s><s>media encoder and i still aren't speaking. 
i still haven't been able to get the second two templates to work - but i just got done rendering my project on the first template and it worked like a charm.</s><s> so that's when i decided to pop over here. 
</s><s>what exactly do you have going on, emily?</s><s> i'm wondering now if not only pre-composing, but pre-rendering as much as you can will help.</s><s> at least i hope it will! 
</s><s>it's either that or take a sledgehammer to it - which is still a possibility for me. hehe!

<s>minnesotadad, 
</s><s>i have never encountered such an issue. 
</s><s>since you are going to encore, to author a dvd-video, i would do the following: 
set the video export, just as you have done.</s><s> set the audio export to pcm/wav, instead of dd (which should have produced an ac3, and not the .</s><s>aac, that you have gotten) set the multiplexer to none, so that it *should* produce an mpeg-2 dvd video file, and a separate wav file encode 
if that does get you the two separate streams, the video and the audio, just import the video into encore as a timeline, and the wav as an asset.</s><s> when imported, drag the wav to the timeline with the mpeg-2 dvd, where it should snap into place. 
</s><s>it is almost as though ame is not registering the video stream from prpro.</s><s> you don't have the video track(s) turned off, do you? 
</s><s>if that is still not working, i would try the adl (adobe dynamic link) to encore, to test that process, as it might get you what you need, though with encore's transcoding.</s><s> this would be a workaround, of sorts, to get the project out of the door. 
</s><s>just thinking here, trying to come up with something that will work for you.

<s>minnesotadad, 
</s><s>i have never encountered such an issue. 
</s><s>since you are going to encore, to author a dvd-video, i would do the following: 
set the video export, just as you have done.</s><s> set the audio export to pcm/wav, instead of dd (which should have produced an ac3, and not the .</s><s>aac, that you have gotten) set the multiplexer to none, so that it *should* produce an mpeg-2 dvd video file, and a separate wav file encode 
if that does get you the two separate streams, the video and the audio, just import the video into encore as a timeline, and the wav as an asset.</s><s> when imported, drag the wav to the timeline with the mpeg-2 dvd, where it should snap into place. 
</s><s>it is almost as though ame is not registering the video stream from prpro.</s><s> you don't have the video track(s) turned off, do you? 
</s><s>if that is still not working, i would try the adl (adobe dynamic link) to encore, to test that process, as it might get you what you need, though with encore's transcoding.</s><s> this would be a workaround, of sorts, to get the project out of the door. 
</s><s>just thinking here, trying to come up with something that will work for you. 
</s><s>good luck, 
hunt 
ps - well-written post, btw. lot's of good information there.</s><s> wish that more folk would post as well.

<s>larry, mark, jim & bill - it is 1 am tuesday morning and i'd do a primal scream if my family weren't all sleeping upstairs.</s><s> somewhere along the way, i either read or was given the advice to just skip ame, load my videos as timelines in encore, and just do the transcoding there.</s><s> i spent almost a day trying to figure out how to get "buttons" for my menus i was building (they weren't appearing in encore's library like they should) and eventually found a simply workaround.</s><s> so i then spent the last 24 hours or so building all my menus, creating small clips for my "motion menu" buttons, getting all that straightened away.</s><s> got really excited earlier tonight since it seemed like i was nearly finished and coming down the home stretch.</s><s> i hit "build" in encore, went away for a couple hours, and came back to find a big error message awaiting me telling me that "encoding failed." i have read a lot of posts, and the outlook is not good, or at least the possible solution not simple or short from a time perspective.</s><s> i have a 100 families awaiting their dvd they've paid for that they initially were told they'd have by mid-february.</s><s> i've been telling everybody that they would have it - guaranteed - by this weekend when there's a band festival that would be ideal for distribution.</s><s> the dvd duplication company says they have to have it by wed morning at the absolute latest.</s><s> meaning i've got about 24 hours to figure this out and burn my dual-layer masters of the two dvds or once again tell people "i know i guaranteed you'd have it by this weekend, but i don't have it ready yet." almost as importantly, i can't afford to keep spending the hours and hours and hours on this that i have.</s><s> it's impacting my personal and professional life.</s><s> thus the primal scream. 
</s><s>the posts i read about the encoding failure all pretty much advise that i use ame to do all the transcoding work.</s><s> which of course brings me squarely back to my original problem: i cannot get a video file out of ame. 
</s><s>i'm embedding a screenshot of what i see when i click on the pull-down menu in the ame dialogue window.</s><s> the problem: there is no mpeg2-dvd option listed to be chosen. 

</s><s>although i'm relatively new to forums, i've read enough posts by now that it seems like most people are in crisis mode when they post.</s><s> so i realize my situation is not all that unique.</s><s> but from a newbie rookie in the field to you experts, i really could use some assistance right now, because between this and the long, cold winter we've had, i'm about to lose it. :-) 
</s><s>p.s.</s><s> mark, in answer to your question about frame rates, i have 18 different videos/films/projects that i'm including in my two dvd-set.</s><s> there have probably been nearly 6-7 different cameras that have contributed footage to one or more of those films by borrowing camcorders of different brands and types and quality levels from people.</s><s> nearly every one of those 18 films have multi-camera sequences in them.</s><s> and many films are collections of sequences which themselves are "nested sequences" sometimes three deep.</s><s> in otherwords, there is no way i can tell you all the various frame rates that may be represented among these 18 separate projects and i certainly can't go back and hope to change them all to the same one.

<s>another way of sending premiere sequences to ame is to drag them from premiere's project panel directly into ame's queue.</s><s> if you do that does your sequence still show up as an audio file?</s><s> also, can you post a screen shot of ame's queue so we can see what it looks like?

<s>i'm wrestling with this same issue.</s><s> i'm on windows 7using adobe premiere pro cs6.</s><s> i'm producing a two disc, dual layer dvd set for 100 families of my son's marching band.</s><s> i have a half hour "masterwork" of interviews, performance segments, rehearsal sequences, credits, etc that i've edited together complete with sound, etc.</s><s> i also then have various other video segments from the season, some high quality (1920x1080) and some lower quality.</s><s> rather than import everything into encore and have encore transcode them all at the same quality, i wanted to ensure that the half-hour piece and certain other segments were transcoded as high quality as possible and given the largest file sizes i could and then transcode other segments as needed so everything would fit on the discs.</s><s> the company i'm using to duplicate/replicate the 100 dvds from my master dvd advised me to encode them first in premiere pro as desired, and then import those files into encore.</s><s> i've used adobe media encoder a lot to export the individual segments into files i could upload to youtube and have had no problem.</s><s> but now, two things happen: 1) ame automatically designates the "output file" with an .aac extension 2) when i do an "import as" of the ame encoded file in encore it only loads an audio file (obviously)   whassup?   here are the settings i use in my export media dialogue in premiere pro cs6: format: mpeg2-dvd preset: ntsc widescreen high quality output name (and filetype): ______ name with save as type of "video files(*.mpg) both the "export video" and "export audio" boxes are checked filters tab: left as is, don't do anything here multiplexer tab: choose the "dvd" button (vs the "none" button) bitrate type: left as variable which is what is selected as a default video tab: codec: reads mainconcept mpeg video quality: increase it to the max of 5 tv standard: ntsc frame rate: 29.97 field order: none (progressive) pixel aspect ration: widescreen 16:9 render at maximum depth box checked bitrate encoding: i choose cbr for my high quality segments and vbr 2-pass for my lower quality segments bitrate: kick it up to the max for high qulaity segments, adjust as needed to get the filesize i want for my lower quality segments audio tab: audio format: dolby digital codec: dolby digital bitrate: at least 320, sometimes higher for the segments i want to be the highest quality   i check the "use maximum render quality" box i chose "queue" for everything and then let it run overnight   so... what am i doing wrong, helpful experts?</s><s>?</s><s>?</s><s>?</s><s>
