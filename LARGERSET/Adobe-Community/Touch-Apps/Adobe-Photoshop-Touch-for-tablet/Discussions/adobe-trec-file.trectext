<s>hi whartan, 
try putting your pictures in the native pictures folder for your device.</s><s> with my android device connected to my pc i saw a folder labelled pictures on the device.</s><s> after copying images there, they were available under the ps touch in the local photos. 
</s><s>you shouldn't need to go through the refund process just to reinstall ps touch.</s><s> to reinstall you should just need to launch the android marketplace app and then go to the "my apps" section, in there should be a list all of your purchased apps and allow you install any you own but are not currently installed.

<s>thanks for your patience trying to figure this out. 
</s><s>as a test try taking a picture with the tablet as well as a screen captures.</s><s> these should also be viewable inside of the local pictures in ps touch

<s>@dave and ibarrien, i have tested out the suggestions and the answer is pretty much the same as north_arm one thing is that picture that you take using the camera through ps touch can be edited but it won't show up in the local photos. 
i have also move files around to new folder and put copies of the photo (1 jpg) to multiple folders: download, dcim/camera, photo album, pictures internally and on the sdcard, none show up in local photos under ps touch. 
@north_arm - do you have multiple accounts in your tablet or only one?

* using root uninstaller to back up and uninstall the gallery system app (root required) * reinstalling gallery from the backup * deleting all unavailable cifs-mounted (network shared) folders from the gallery within gallery

<s>yes and no!</s><s>

<s>@dave and ibarrien, i have tested out the suggestions and the answer is pretty much the same as north_arm one thing is that picture that you take using the camera through ps touch can be edited but it won't show up in the local photos. 
i have also move files around to new folder and put copies of the photo (1 jpg) to multiple folders: download, dcim/camera, photo album, pictures internally and on the sdcard, none show up in local photos under ps touch.

<s>yes and no!</s><s> 
</s><s>earlier android versions would use a physical sd card for mass storage but more recent devices don't.</s><s> however, they still refer to the storage as being on the "internal" sd.</s><s> whether this is actually an sd card or not i have no idea because it is built into the device.</s><s> when you browse the files it looks like a separate sd card and most apps will refer to it as being the sd card.

<s>hi david, 
- does turning sync off and then back on again make any difference? - how much space was used on the prior creative cloud account which failed? - how much free space on the iphone 
just to recap, please correct me if i'm wrong sync doesn't work on the iphone with the original account but it does on a newly created free 2gb account on the old non-working account photoshop touch would always get stuck at 0% on all devices

<s>hello there, 
i am using pst on my unrooted, pretty much brand spankin' new asus transformer tf101 and, frankly, it runs beautifully.</s><s> there are a few hiccups here and there but nothing i can't live with.</s><s> except...</s><s> 
</s><s>i have never gotten the "facebook part" of pst working.</s><s> i can sign into fb and am greeted with a huge blank-white popup that simply says "success" in the upper left-hand corner in black system text.</s><s> it just "looks" very sketchy--most non-adobe looking!</s><s> from here the only place to go is the close button to close the popup. 
</s><s>needless to say, if i try to publish to fb--big white pop-up with "success" in the upper-left appears.</s><s> the image does not get published to facebook. 
</s><s>and photo access, that's interesting too!</s><s> when i go to open a photo and choose to open from facebook (which, i assume, shows me my current fb photos?</s><s> i haven't gotten it to work yet!</s><s>) guess what happens?</s><s> yep...a big white pop-up with "success" in the upper-left appear appears yet again, yet i am never greeted to images. 
</s><s>well, the good thing is that it's saying "success" instead of "failure" or "you're a compleat n00b idiot." that has to count for something... ;') 
</s><s>adobe, a little help here?

i have also move files around to new folder and put copies of the photo (1 jpg) to multiple folders: download, dcim/camera, photo album, pictures internally and on the sdcard, none show up in local photos under ps touch.

<s>adobe doesn't need to check, what "hackers" do for running ps touch von galaxy note ... it's an adobe-made barrage, which locks up ps touch.</s><s> if you wanna have ps touch you could root your note, set the density / dpi on a higher or lower level (dunno, which one because never did it myself, but watched many tuts about doing it) and you can download ps touch from the market as original app.</s><s> it runs as it comes, you don't have to crack anything. 
</s><s>the problem on this mehtod is, that rooting your phone kills the warrenty, as far as i know.</s><s> but if that's no prob for you, this method (seen on youtube many times) works very well.</s><s> here you can see, that it's no problem of the note or of ps touch but only made by the lock made by adobe, which barrages ps touch for all devices under a defined density, so that it shall only work on tablets 
if there is a note-2 releasing next year, ps touch might be running because of another density 


</s><s>so the whole problem is, that adobe do not want to open ps touch for smarttabs and smartphones (maybe because there might be a higher value of issues, causing on most times lower capacity.</s><s> but be honest: the galaxy note has better stats than most of the tablets!</s><s> and the siii is getting overpowered with its quadcore, so that photoshop run even better than on most pcs

<s>good evening mates! 
</s><s>ics is out since some weeks now ... hope you got it right now but !</s><s> android market tells for photoshop touch "your phone is not compatible to this app" and denies the download ... as most people know: photoshop touch was compatible since gingerbread 2.3.6 (as cracked version // saw it somewhere on youtube.com) and is definitely compatible since ics 4.0. 
</s><s>the problem is, that you only get photoshop touch for galaxy note only on two ways: 1. you could load a cracked apk from photosho touch, but as a man, having original adobe products and working productive (and paid) with that, this option is absolutly unacceptable for me.</s><s> 2. you could root your phone, decreasing the density on <150 dpi and than download it as an tablet-app (heared about it, but sounds senseless for me ?</s><s>!</s><s> ).</s><s> 
</s><s>so what the hell are google and adobe doing here?</s><s> and asking you dave: is that a problem made by adobe, because they do not allow licencing photoshop touch for galaxy note (because it's no tablet ...</s><s>) or is that a f***ing google-issue, because they are to mad for realising, that galaxy note now does have ics 4.0.3 ?</s><s>?</s><s>?</s><s>

<s>adobe doesn't need to check, what "hackers" do for running ps touch von galaxy note ... it's an adobe-made barrage, which locks up ps touch.</s><s> if you wanna have ps touch you could root your note, set the density / dpi on a higher or lower level (dunno, which one because never did it myself, but watched many tuts about doing it) and you can download ps touch from the market as original app.</s><s> it runs as it comes, you don't have to crack anything. 
</s><s>the problem on this mehtod is, that rooting your phone kills the warrenty, as far as i know.</s><s> but if that's no prob for you, this method (seen on youtube many times) works very well.</s><s> here you can see, that it's no problem of the note or of ps touch but only made by the lock made by adobe, which barrages ps touch for all devices under a defined density, so that it shall only work on tablets 
if there is a note-2 releasing next year, ps touch might be running because of another density 


</s><s>so the whole problem is, that adobe do not want to open ps touch for smarttabs and smartphones (maybe because there might be a higher value of issues, causing on most times lower capacity.</s><s> but be honest: the galaxy note has better stats than most of the tablets!</s><s> and the siii is getting overpowered with its quadcore, so that photoshop run even better than on most pcs
