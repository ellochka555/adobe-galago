<s>michael, if you are able to get to the site in the browser, but are still getting the 2038 error in de, the next most likely problem is that an application level firewall on your computer such as (but not limited to) zonealarm (windows) or little snitch (mac) is preventing de from making an outgoing http connection.</s><s> please check your computer configuration for any such programs and if they exist, enable outgoing connections for de.</s><s> another less likely possibility is that you are using a proxy connection to the internet, and have it set up correctly for your preferred browser but not for the system as a whole.</s><s> for instance if you are using firefox, also check to make sure can get to the site using ie (win) or safari (mac).</s><s> if this still doesn't work, i would suggest that you open up a support case, so that bentley and crew can get more information form you (and so that this can be tracked appropriately). -- jim lester adobe systems

<s>michael, if you are able to get to the site in the browser, but are still getting the 2038 error in de, the next most likely problem is that an application level firewall on your computer such as (but not limited to) zonealarm (windows) or little snitch (mac) is preventing de from making an outgoing http connection.</s><s> please check your computer configuration for any such programs and if they exist, enable outgoing connections for de.</s><s> another less likely possibility is that you are using a proxy connection to the internet, and have it set up correctly for your preferred browser but not for the system as a whole.</s><s> for instance if you are using firefox, also check to make sure can get to the site using ie (win) or safari (mac).</s><s> if this still doesn't work, i would suggest that you open up a support case, so that bentley and crew can get more information form you (and so that this can be tracked appropriately). -- jim lester adobe systems

<s>just to clarify, there are two levels of authorization -- one for the ade software and one for the nook.</s><s> you have to use your adobe account to authorize both (and they have to be authorized with the same user name).</s><s> it sounded like your original problem (kcoline) was with the nook authorization, and it was the same problem the rest of us were having. 
</s><s>to get your files back, i suggest carefully reading over the "activation and authorization" section of the ade help.</s><s> it appears that ade will automatically find your files but note the "note" in quoted text below... http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/help/ 
</s><s>"after activation, any books, magazines, or other documents you previously bought with adobe acrobat® or reader® software are migrated to adobe digital editions.</s><s> this is usually a relatively quick process.</s><s> adobe digital editions opens each item and reverifies its license to the user.</s><s> if you don't have drm-protected items, you don't need to be online during the migration.</s><s> if you have a large number of items (for example, more than 100), then this process may take a while, but you will see a progress bar indicating the state of the migration as it proceeds.</s><s> note: items that you previously borrowed from a public library with adobe acrobat® or reader® software are not migrated to adobe digital editions.</s><s> you need to return the library item and then borrow the item again with digital editions." if it's not finding your files, it may be because they're located in a folder different from the one that ade is trying to use to find them. 
</s><s>you may also want to check the "transferring items between computers" section, as this describes where the files should be located, and how to reimport them into your library.

<s>just to clarify, there are two levels of authorization -- one for the ade software and one for the nook.</s><s> you have to use your adobe account to authorize both (and they have to be authorized with the same user name).</s><s> it sounded like your original problem (kcoline) was with the nook authorization, and it was the same problem the rest of us were having. 
</s><s>to get your files back, i suggest carefully reading over the "activation and authorization" section of the ade help.</s><s> it appears that ade will automatically find your files but note the "note" in quoted text below... http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/help/ 
</s><s>"after activation, any books, magazines, or other documents you previously bought with adobe acrobat® or reader® software are migrated to adobe digital editions.</s><s> this is usually a relatively quick process.</s><s> adobe digital editions opens each item and reverifies its license to the user.</s><s> if you don't have drm-protected items, you don't need to be online during the migration.</s><s> if you have a large number of items (for example, more than 100), then this process may take a while, but you will see a progress bar indicating the state of the migration as it proceeds.</s><s> note: items that you previously borrowed from a public library with adobe acrobat® or reader® software are not migrated to adobe digital editions.</s><s> you need to return the library item and then borrow the item again with digital editions." if it's not finding your files, it may be because they're located in a folder different from the one that ade is trying to use to find them. 
</s><s>you may also want to check the "transferring items between computers" section, as this describes where the files should be located, and how to reimport them into your library. 
</s><s>good luck!

<s>just fyi, according to barnes & noble's own "knowledgbase" they are aware of this problem.</s><s> at the bottom of a page discussing this problem, in a small note, is the following (word for word): 
</s><s>"note: you may be required to re-authorize the nook after any software update has occurred (i.e. updating nook color from version 1.4.1 to version 1.4.2).</s><s> any previously side loaded libary books will provide the "user not authorized" message when attempting to open after a software update." 
</s><s>in other words, barnes and noble is forcing users to go through this process of: deleting the folders and files for ade on the nook, deleting all their previously loaded library books from both the nook and ade, re-authorizing their nook, re-downloading their borrowed library books into ade, and then re-uploading those titles to their nook.</s><s> what fantastic customer service.</s><s> sarcasm noted, i hope.

<s>to all having problems with authorizing your nook if you are using a mac 
i was pulling my hair out, especially when people said to delete the file and then ade would quickly recognize the nook and authorize it. 
i didn't have a file to delete!</s><s>!</s><s> 
</s><s>then: 
</s><s>this is how i corrected the problem: 
i have a mac, and was having difficulty.</s><s> there was no digital editions folder on my nook (at least viewable on my mac). 
i plugged my nook into a windows xp pc, and lo and behold, there was a file on my nook something like: .adobe.digital.editions. 
i deleted this file and then plugged my nook back into my mac. 
</s><s>then, ade recognized my nook and authorized it, and now i'm good to go!</s><s>!</s><s> 


</s><s>so if you are having a problem getting ade to recognize/authorize your nook and you are having a problem, find a windows machine, plug it in, and if there is a file there to delete as suggested in above posts, delete it.</s><s> then go back to your mac and try again.</s><s> worked for me!</s><s>!</s><s>

<s>to all having problems with authorizing your nook if you are using a mac

</s><s>then: 
</s><s>this is how i corrected the problem: 
i have a mac, and was having difficulty.</s><s> there was no digital editions folder on my nook (at least viewable on my mac). 
i plugged my nook into a windows xp pc, and lo and behold, there was a file on my nook something like: .adobe.digital.editions.

<s>i just discovered this thread after sharing similar frustrations with ade and ipad.</s><s> the .ascm file that's created in your de directory on your computer when you buy a drm-protected book is just the key that unlocks the pdf of the book file, the one that you read within de.

<s>i recently discovered txtr, which supports epub books with ade drm.</s><s> i say "discovered", but really i mean "noticed it on the list of supported devices/apps and gave it a try." getting the books onto an android device is a little bit clunky, but once there, the books are readable. 
</s><s>to get the app/phone ready: search for txtr in the market and install start the app, go to the settings screen, and enter your adobe account details also on the settings screen, select 'sign up for free' to create a txtr account close the app 
to transfer books to the device: plug the device into the computer with ade the device should now be recognized in ade as a result of init step 2 above use ade to transfer the book(s) to the device, necessary to get the license onto the device in a file browser, go to the digital editions folder and delete the book's epub file (txtr won't be able to find it) safely disconnect the device from your computer in a web browser, log in at www.txtr.com and upload the book(s) from wherever ade put them on the computer (it's 'my documents' for me) now, finally, on the android device, open txtr, go to the 'archive' tab, select the collection where you uploaded the book(s) download the book(s) read! 
</s><s>like i said, getting books onto the phone along with a usable license is a pain.</s><s> it would be nice if txtr could just find them in the 'digital editions' folder, since then you wouldn't need a txtr.com account or the extra upload/download steps.</s><s> still, this is the only method i've found that actually works for reading library books on my phone, and once you know the method, it's not that big a deal.

<s>i recently discovered txtr, which supports epub books with ade drm.</s><s> i say "discovered", but really i mean "noticed it on the list of supported devices/apps and gave it a try." getting the books onto an android device is a little bit clunky, but once there, the books are readable. 
</s><s>to get the app/phone ready: search for txtr in the market and install start the app, go to the settings screen, and enter your adobe account details also on the settings screen, select 'sign up for free' to create a txtr account close the app 
to transfer books to the device: plug the device into the computer with ade the device should now be recognized in ade as a result of init step 2 above use ade to transfer the book(s) to the device, necessary to get the license onto the device in a file browser, go to the digital editions folder and delete the book's epub file (txtr won't be able to find it) safely disconnect the device from your computer in a web browser, log in at www.txtr.com and upload the book(s) from wherever ade put them on the computer (it's 'my documents' for me) now, finally, on the android device, open txtr, go to the 'archive' tab, select the collection where you uploaded the book(s) download the book(s) read! 
</s><s>like i said, getting books onto the phone along with a usable license is a pain.</s><s> it would be nice if txtr could just find them in the 'digital editions' folder, since then you wouldn't need a txtr.com account or the extra upload/download steps.</s><s> still, this is the only method i've found that actually works for reading library books on my phone, and once you know the method, it's not that big a deal.

</s><s>if you use the 'sign up for free account' option from the txtr settings menu, it does not ask for either an address or a credit card, so you may need to read my previous directions more carefully.</s><s> if you are having trouble with one or more of the steps in my origin post, tell us which one and we might be able to help.

<s>thanks tons for getting me started with txtr.</s><s> i just thought i would add my slightly different experience in successfully transferring an epub from the library onto my phone (in this case, a motorola droid). 
i started off the same way.</s><s> i set up my txtr account online and uploaded the epub file to txtr.</s><s> i also set up the txtr app on my phone with my ade account info. now here's where things are a little different. 
1.</s><s> i downloaded the file onto my phone using txtr.</s><s> once downloaded, do not click "read". 
2.</s><s> i connected my phone to my computer and activated it as a usb drive. 
3.</s><s> i opened adobe digital editions and it recognized my phone as a device (for some reason it identified it as a nook - maybe because i downloaded the app). 
4.</s><s> i clicked on my device in ade to make sure my epub showed up as being on my device.</s><s> this seems to be the only thing needed to activate permissions.</s><s> i checked the item info, and the file ade finds is located in the txtr folder on my phone. 
5.</s><s> i then disconnected my phone as a usb device. 
6.</s><s> i loaded txtr, found my book, and only then clicked "read." 
i don't know if this works for everyone, but i couldn't transfer the book to my device any other way.</s><s> btw - if you click "read" before connecting to the computer and allowing ade to find the book on your device first, something messes up (probably the drm) and txtr won't be able to read it.</s><s> you'll have to delete the files on your phone and then redo the six steps.

<s>in case persons following this thread didn't see my post earlier today on my own thread about problems i was having between glo and ade/ drm content: 
before performing the factory reset and re-setting up your glo from the factory reboot, first un-install the kobo desktop application that's on your computer from your previous installation. 
i didn't do this on my first re-setup, and that's when ade stopping recognizing my glo even though windows could see it, and glo had lost its adobe authorization for drm content.</s><s> however, on a hunch, i tried again after first uninstalling kobo desktop.</s><s> on the re-setup following the factory reset, i got a few rather different screens from kobo desktop during setup, even though when finished i discovered that it was the same version of kobo desktop as what i'd had before.</s><s> there may have been something corrupted in the kobo desktop from the first ("unclean") reinstallation, which might have been causing the ade/drm issues. 
</s><s>if all else fails, try this.</s><s> uninstall kobo desktop from your computer.</s><s> then do a factory reset on glo.</s><s> then re-setup glo, which will result in an automatic reinstallation (this time a clean one) of kobo desktop.</s><s> then connect to ade and authorize the glo.</s><s> it worked for me. 
</s><s>of course the factory reset will remove all e-books on your glo and all your annotations, bookmarks, and bookshelves.</s><s> but you'll be able to get at your e-books again through ade, after re-authorizing it (which should happen automatically when you open ade after first connecting your re-setup glo to your computer).</s><s> it's a nuisance, but it will work, or it did for me. 
other advice: once glo is up and running, never log off your kobo account from your glo settings menu (that's what triggered all my problems), no idea why it should be so problematic to do that but it was in my case.</s><s> and, if you buy content from kobo's ebook site, don't use kobo desktop to sync or download the content to your glo, go to your purchased items folder on your on-line kobo account and install the book into ade by running the link you get from the "download epub drm" button next to the item in your kobo account purchases list, and then drag it into the kobo shelf in ade after you've connected the kobo to ade.</s><s> it doesn't take any more time to do this (i found kobo desktop excruciatingly slow in syncing and updating new content anyway) and in my experience it's much more reliable to do the transfers via ade, once you can connect to it. 
</s><s>don't bother syncing content on multiple devices via kobo website or apps, it was a nightmare between my glo, wifi and ipod app, and caused me far more grief than it was worth imo.</s><s> if you want to sync bookmarks across devices, do it manually, not via kobo's software; it's safer manually, and given the problems that i encountered, it would actually have taken me much less time and with more satisfactory results in the end.

<s>was just about to embark on this suggestion and began first by uninstalling the kobo desktop already on my laptop.</s><s> instead of proceeding as outlined i went into my adobe id where the book i borrowed from my library was sitting.</s><s> my glo e reader was connected and i right clicked the book and found i was able to send it to the reader.</s><s> (previously this had been greyed out) lo and behold there it was sitting in the glo ready to be read.</s><s> so i didn't need to do a factory reset etc by which i would have lost a purchased book.</s><s> hope this makes sense.</s><s> don't know why it worked but it seems to be connected to the uninstalling of the kobo desktop set up and then re-trying the downloading of the library book from the laptop (authorised) computer.

<s>hi longvale1.</s><s> that is very interesting.</s><s> if you haven't already done so, i urge you to report this to kobo customer support.</s><s> i've told them my experiences and some of my concerns about kobo desktop, and i've found their tech people very responsive, they told me they were passing my comments on to their software development team.</s><s> i think what you've found may help them to identify what the problem is with that very quirky and problematic kobo desktop software (which i find i have absolutely no need for once i've set up my kobo glo, i can do all the purchasing i need from the kobo.com website and install via adobe digital editions; i haven't tried the wifi ordering on glo yet so i don't know if that causes any problems).</s><s> i'm going to pass along your finding to my local public library, because i know the librarians are getting complaints from people who are having problems getting library drm epub books onto their kobos.</s><s> when contacting kobo support be sure to tell when whether you're on a mac or a pc and what version of the operating system you're running, though i'd hope if you forgot that they'd ask.</s><s> but the people who answer emails or web queries aren't usually the tech support types and might not think to ask that.

<subject>Can't open DRM ebooks on Kobo Glo</subject>
<post author="Togo1518" timestamp="Mar 24, 2013 10:42 AM">
<s>in case persons following this thread didn't see my post earlier today on my own thread about problems i was having between glo and ade/ drm content: 
before performing the factory reset and re-setting up your glo from the factory reboot, first un-install the kobo desktop application that's on your computer from your previous installation. 
i didn't do this on my first re-setup, and that's when ade stopping recognizing my glo even though windows could see it, and glo had lost its adobe authorization for drm content.</s><s> however, on a hunch, i tried again after first uninstalling kobo desktop.</s><s> on the re-setup following the factory reset, i got a few rather different screens from kobo desktop during setup, even though when finished i discovered that it was the same version of kobo desktop as what i'd had before.</s><s> there may have been something corrupted in the kobo desktop from the first ("unclean") reinstallation, which might have been causing the ade/drm issues. 
</s><s>if all else fails, try this.</s><s> uninstall kobo desktop from your computer.</s><s> then do a factory reset on glo.</s><s> then re-setup glo, which will result in an automatic reinstallation (this time a clean one) of kobo desktop.</s><s> then connect to ade and authorize the glo.</s><s> it worked for me. 
</s><s>of course the factory reset will remove all e-books on your glo and all your annotations, bookmarks, and bookshelves.</s><s> but you'll be able to get at your e-books again through ade, after re-authorizing it (which should happen automatically when you open ade after first connecting your re-setup glo to your computer).</s><s> it's a nuisance, but it will work, or it did for me. 
other advice: once glo is up and running, never log off your kobo account from your glo settings menu (that's what triggered all my problems), no idea why it should be so problematic to do that but it was in my case.</s><s> and, if you buy content from kobo's ebook site, don't use kobo desktop to sync or download the content to your glo, go to your purchased items folder on your on-line kobo account and install the book into ade by running the link you get from the "download epub drm" button next to the item in your kobo account purchases list, and then drag it into the kobo shelf in ade after you've connected the kobo to ade.</s><s> it doesn't take any more time to do this (i found kobo desktop excruciatingly slow in syncing and updating new content anyway) and in my experience it's much more reliable to do the transfers via ade, once you can connect to it. 
</s><s>don't bother syncing content on multiple devices via kobo website or apps, it was a nightmare between my glo, wifi and ipod app, and caused me far more grief than it was worth imo.</s><s> if you want to sync bookmarks across devices, do it manually, not via kobo's software; it's safer manually, and given the problems that i encountered, it would actually have taken me much less time and with more satisfactory results in the end.

<s>hi longvale1.</s><s> that is very interesting.</s><s> if you haven't already done so, i urge you to report this to kobo customer support.</s><s> i've told them my experiences and some of my concerns about kobo desktop, and i've found their tech people very responsive, they told me they were passing my comments on to their software development team.</s><s> i think what you've found may help them to identify what the problem is with that very quirky and problematic kobo desktop software (which i find i have absolutely no need for once i've set up my kobo glo, i can do all the purchasing i need from the kobo.com website and install via adobe digital editions; i haven't tried the wifi ordering on glo yet so i don't know if that causes any problems).</s><s> i'm going to pass along your finding to my local public library, because i know the librarians are getting complaints from people who are having problems getting library drm epub books onto their kobos.</s><s> when contacting kobo support be sure to tell when whether you're on a mac or a pc and what version of the operating system you're running, though i'd hope if you forgot that they'd ask.</s><s> but the people who answer emails or web queries aren't usually the tech support types and might not think to ask that.

<s>hi togo 1518, thanks for your feedback.</s><s> your mention of libraries having complaints about kobo.</s><s> that's ironic because i chose a kobo reader rather than a kindle because i had read the latter was incompatible with my local library here in western' australia, but kobo was ok!</s><s>!</s><s>.</s><s> i initially tried to download the library book thru the kobo wifi feature but i was unable to proceed to my library's login in page because there was no 'next' button available on the screen.</s><s> that's why i ended up downloading it onto my kobo desktop with the ensuing problem!</s><s> so i don't know whether i might have some similar problem with purchasing a book from kobo direct through the reader .</s><s>( going on the net thru the reader is not a good experience.</s><s> i find it's tortuous and a bit "gluggy" trying to type in necessary details.</s><s>) i also find the black "connected and charging" screen on the reader very disconcerting when i was trying to download the library book onto the reader from my laptop.</s><s> (pc running windows 7 home premium 64bit).</s><s> it basically doesn't tell u what's going on during the download process and one is left wondering until its disconnected and switched on whether the download was a success or not!</s><s>!</s><s> however as you suggest i will pass on my experience along with the thread of the conversation with u to kobo for them to work on.

<s>this is all pussy-footing around a really serious issue.</s><s> windows tr surface tablets are a mainstream device that is here to stay, and every microsoft and adobe customer has a reasonable expectation that mainstream e-products they have bought - such as adobe drm-protected e-books from mainstream e-book sellers/publishers - will not be locked out from being used on such a device.</s><s> having lumbered the world of e-books with the chastity belt of drm, adobe has a direct responsibility to make sure that its much-touted universal solution to copyright protection on e-books does not discriminate against or disadvantage those of us who have a microsoft surface tablet instead of an ipad or an android device. 
</s><s>it is not good enough for adobe spokespersons to tell us - as on this forum - that it is too expensive or too much trouble, or that we should not buy this mainstream device but go with that because they can't be bothered living up to the hype about adobe digital editions that heas lured e-book publishers into using the platform.

</s><s>as for your plans -- i wouldn't be surprised if you found that the performance of any tablet, surface or others, is not up to the task of running photoshop.</s><s> be sure to check into how much ram and disk space you'll need!

<s>this is all pussy-footing around a really serious issue.</s><s> windows tr surface tablets are a mainstream device that is here to stay, and every microsoft and adobe customer has a reasonable expectation that mainstream e-products they have bought - such as adobe drm-protected e-books from mainstream e-book sellers/publishers - will not be locked out from being used on such a device.</s><s> having lumbered the world of e-books with the chastity belt of drm, adobe has a direct responsibility to make sure that its much-touted universal solution to copyright protection on e-books does not discriminate against or disadvantage those of us who have a microsoft surface tablet instead of an ipad or an android device. 
</s><s>it is not good enough for adobe spokespersons to tell us - as on this forum - that it is too expensive or too much trouble, or that we should not buy this mainstream device but go with that because they can't be bothered living up to the hype about adobe digital editions that heas lured e-book publishers into using the platform. 
</s><s>now i have to complain to certain e-book publishers that they have let down the customer by publishing only in drm-pdf format instead of something civilised and truly transportable between a legitimate customer's portable devices, such as epub.</s><s> and i'm talking about expensive academic and technical e-publications at $50 or more each, not $2.99 bodice-rippers!
