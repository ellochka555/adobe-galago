<s>maybe i the one i just downloaded is a newer version, but i found a checkbox for "automatically launch on startup" in the options pages. look in the top right corner of the player for "option" and click on it; should load the options page.</s><s> then look down the list for "automatic notifications" and click on that (gee, that's intuitive) which should expose checkboxes for "automatically launch on startup" and "close ... to taskbar".</s><s> i recommend you uncheck both of those.

<s>i was under the impression that this player would at least allow us to watch tv shows or "on-demand" type programming without having to actually visit the web site that contains the flash video. if we have to visit the web site anyways (rather than choosing from a list of available content, not only is it full of adobe ads but it is redundant as well. it would be interesting only if there was a list of "stations or shows" that one could pick to play content directly. -- jerry [sig deleted]
