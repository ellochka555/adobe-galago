<s>not a joke: i once found aleksandr solzhenitsyn's 'gulag archipelago' in one of the (now defunct) border's book stores filed in the fiction section.</s><s> when i brought it to the manager's attention, the lady tried to argue the point.</s><s> until i and several other customers (including one marvelous old russian lady) convinced her look it up in their own computer system.</s><s> the manager's excuse was very similar to that of the person in your joke.

<s>in total contrast to this, two bookstores stand out in my memory... in the '76-'84 period. 
</s><s>one was in delhi...</s><s> i think it was called 'the bookworm'... the owner was extremely well read.</s><s> i'm pretty sure, that if he hadn't read every title in stock, he'd at least skimmed through the one's he hadn't read.</s><s> it was a real pleasure browsing there and he put me onto a lot of authors i hadn't even heard of. 
</s><s>the other was in bangalore - i can't remember the name...</s><s> may just have been 'the bookshop'.</s><s> a total contrast!</s><s> books all over the place.... on shelves, on tables and even on the floor!</s><s> browsing was great, but finding a particular book was a nightmare.</s><s> again, enter the owner/manager.</s><s> name a title and he'd ponder for a second or two... eyes closed, forefinger in the air... then he'd point and be off!</s><s> unerringly, straight to the book.</s><s> it was as though he knew every book in the shop... and this was way before computers!</s><s>!</s><s> incredible.</s><s> again, erudite and knowledgeable as well. 
</s><s>similar experiences in a couple of bookshops in calcutta and bombay... they were very close but not quite up to those two.</s><s> probably because they were just employees!
