<subject>Camera icon for including non-images?</subject>

<subject>Camera icon for including non-images?</subject>

<s>strange and stranger.</s><s> i must assume this is caused by update attempts by adobe or jive.</s><s> i never had this kind of trouble with quoting jive messages in opera or anything else.</s><s> i also sent a plain old iphone reply prior to this (web) reply that has not appeared. 
</s><s>i'm hoping this is just a temporary setback and that my timing is just terrible. 
</s><s>fwiw, here is the full text of this email reply (sans headers) - assuming nothing gets translated by jive.</s><s> this is the one where i kept the attribution outside the quotes.
