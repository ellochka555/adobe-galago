<s>often a user who posts a problem or question in the forum will be asked to post a screenshot.  this article will explain how to take and post a screenshot.   note that screenshots cannot be attached to email notification replies.     to capture a screenshot...   windows 7, 8, and vista   use the windows snipping tool to take a snapshot of the area you want to capture.  see use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screen-shots for instructions.  save the result as a jpg or png file.   windows xp and earlier   use the print screen button on the keyboard to capture the entire desktop, then use a imaging program like ms paint, paint.net, or similar to paste the captured image.  some programs can crop the area you want to show, so you do not need to post the entire desktop.  save the result as a jpg or png file.   more detailed instructions: take a screenshot on windows xp   alternate screenshot tool: jing (free download)   mac os   see http://www.apple.com/findouthow/mac/#capturescreen     to post the saved screenshot you need to be in the forum editor; either as a new topic, or as a reply to the post requesting a screenshot.</s><s> click on the camera icon in the editor menu to upload the saved image to the current cursor position.

<post author="Jochem van Dieten" timestamp="Aug 23, 2009 10:42 AM">
<s>the forums rely heavily on the caching features of browsers to improve the speed of page rendering.</s><s> performance of these forums should greatly improve after a few pages because more and more of the images, css and javascript is cached in the browser.</s><s> as a consequence, when reporting forums performance issues the report should include some information on the state of the browser cache to determine whether the issue is a browser issue or a server issue.</s><s> such detailed information is generally not available from just watching the browser screen, but needs to come from specialized tools such as performance monitor plugins and recording proxies.   the preferred report method for performance issues is to use the speed reporting features build into or available as a plugin for a browser for both the page you want to report a problem with and several refence pages in the site.</s><s> detailed instructions are listed below separated out for different browsers.</s><s> if possible, please use firefox for submitting the report because it provides an export format that can be read back electronically.   known performance issues   the performance issues with any screen with a rich text editor, such as the reply window and the compose private message window have been acknowleged and improvements are being implemented.   mozilla firefox (preferred)   warning: it is currently not recommended to generate a speed report when logged in.</s><s> the speed report has enough detail for somebody else to hijack your session and impersonate you on the forums.</s><s> if you really must report while logged in, make sure you log out your browser after generating the speed report and wait at least 4 hours before posting.   install the firebug

<subject>How should I report forum performance issues?</subject>
<post author="Jochem van Dieten" timestamp="Aug 23, 2009 10:42 AM">
<s>the forums rely heavily on the caching features of browsers to improve the speed of page rendering.</s><s> performance of these forums should greatly improve after a few pages because more and more of the images, css and javascript is cached in the browser.</s><s> as a consequence, when reporting forums performance issues the report should include some information on the state of the browser cache to determine whether the issue is a browser issue or a server issue.</s><s> such detailed information is generally not available from just watching the browser screen, but needs to come from specialized tools such as performance monitor plugins and recording proxies.   the preferred report method for performance issues is to use the speed reporting features build into or available as a plugin for a browser for both the page you want to report a problem with and several refence pages in the site.</s><s> detailed instructions are listed below separated out for different browsers.</s><s> if possible, please use firefox for submitting the report because it provides an export format that can be read back electronically.   known performance issues   the performance issues with any screen with a rich text editor, such as the reply window and the compose private message window have been acknowleged and improvements are being implemented.   mozilla firefox (preferred)   warning: it is currently not recommended to generate a speed report when logged in.</s><s> the speed report has enough detail for somebody else to hijack your session and impersonate you on the forums.</s><s> if you really must report while logged in, make sure you log out your browser after generating the speed report and wait at least 4 hours before posting.   install the firebug plugin install the netexport 0.6 extension for firebug enable all firebug panels switch to the "net" panel in firebug click on this link export the data from the firebug net panel click on this link

from the firebug net panel click on this link export the data from the firebug net panel browse to the page where you are experiencing the performance problem.</s><s> export the data from the firebug net panel   when you report a performance problem please attach the 6 exports from the firebug net panel and an explanation of how you are experiencing the issues (for instance how much slower it is then normal) and include a description of your internet connection (dial-up, dsl, cable etc.</s><s>) and the country from where you are connecting.</s><s> if you have non-standard tweaks to your firefox configuration (such as pipelining enabled) or are running any plugins please include that information in your report as well.   google chrome open the developer tools (ctrl-shift-j) navigate

<s>flickr's terms of service state that if you post an image hosted on flickr on another site you have to link back to the image page on flickr.</s><s> to do that you need to go to your image on flickr, click on the all sizes link above the image, select the size image you want, then copy the html code from the first box of code underneath the image.</s><s> then, in the forum's rich text editor, click on the >> button/icon and select insert raw html.</s><s> this will open a frame within your message where you paste the html code you copied from the flickr site.</s><s> then continue on with composing your forum message and click "post message" to post the message to the forum system. 

</s><s>for pixentral images, you will need to go to http://www.pixentral.com and upload your image following the instructions there.</s><s> you do not have to check the box to make images public.</s><s> once your image is uploaded there copy the html code from the box below your image.</s><s> then, in the forum's rich text editor, click on the >> button/icon and select insert raw html.</s><s> this wil open a frame within your message where you paste the html code you copied from the pixentral site.</s><s> please note that there is an extra "/" character in the pixentral url that will prevent the image from showing up, so you need to make one change to the html that you copied from the pixentral site.</s><s> the beginning of the html code will look something like this: <a href="http:www.pixentral.com/show.php?picture=16xx5748rt9fhd"/> 
</s><s>please remove the slash that appears between the quotes and the greater than symbol so that this part of the html code looks like this: <a href="http:www.pixentral.com/show.php?picture=16xx5748rt9fhd"> then continue on with composing your forum message and click "post message" to post the message to the forum system.
