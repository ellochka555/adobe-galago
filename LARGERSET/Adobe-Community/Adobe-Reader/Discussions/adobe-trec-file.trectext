<s>to un install the adobe reader 9 or evey any software from your computer, there are two ways to do. 
1.</s><s> you can click on start then settings then control panel then ad remove programs, there you will see adobe reader 9 simply click it and an option of remove will apear.</s><s> so click it and then click uninstall.</s><s> it will automatically un install adobe reader 9 from your computer.</s><s> you can remove or uninstall any software safely from your computer with this method. 
2.</s><s> click on start then programs and there you will see an un install option on the specific software which you wants to un install.</s><s> by the way this 2nd way maybe not used for adobe reader, cause there is no uninstall option for this in the progrms meneu while installing.</s><s> but you can uninstall it with the 1st method.

<s>asker, 
</s><s>when pdf's don't open, there are a couple of things you can try.</s><s> the first thing (also the easiest) it me uninstall the reader by going to (start menu/control panel/add or remove programs) and find adobe reader, don't "repair" although it may seem tempting, simply remove the program and then either download it again or reinstall from the previous download, i would recommend a fresh copy though.</s><s> once the installation is complete, restart the computer.

<s>i had been updating previous versions and there was no problem.</s><s> but this time updating to adobe 11 is a huge one.</s><s> it started some 2-3 weeks ago and since then no solution.</s><s> i was advised to go to the key and change permitting the owner to have all rights.</s><s> i am the owner and the administrator and the only used.</s><s> i saw that regedit did not listen to my command and i was advised to open regedit as the administrator and i did so but the same error persists that i am not allowed to give full rights to the owner.</s><s> administrator has full rights.</s><s> as i saw some strange things, i decided just for fun to disable the righs of the administrators, but that was impossible, by default they have those rights, so i finally gave full rights to administrator-user but eventually that did not help much either, because the reader won't install.</s><s> thank you.</s><s>
