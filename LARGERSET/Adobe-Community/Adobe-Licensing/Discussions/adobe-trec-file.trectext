<subject>Recover Serial from Computer?</subject>
<post author="rafsanchez_hk" timestamp="Nov 29, 2013 1:17 AM">
<s>i run a small photography agency and we have 8 computers and 6 different adobe cs6 products (mainly 'production premium' and 'design and web premium'). 
</s><s>whilst i know which product type is installed on which computer (i.e.</s><s> i know my own mac pro has 'production premium' installed) what i did not mark down is: which of the 3 copies of production premium we have licences for is installed on my machine. 
i ask this because i want to do some moving around of licences (for example i want to de-activate the 'production premium' on my machine and install it on a different machine) but i don't know which of the boxes i should use to install on the new machine. 
</s><s>is it possible to determine from within one of the installed applications which serial number was used to install it? 
thanks!

</s><s>with the creative cloud or a single-app subscription, adobe has changed how the product activation works so that you are able to install and run on both/either operating system platforms with a single purchase. 
</s><s>adobe does offer upgrade pricing to creative cloud (for cs users back to cs3), so that might be an option depending on your needs, if you decide not to get cs6 on its own.

<s>photoshop cs5 was tested on mac os x 10.9 mavericks...</s><s> so it sounds like your validation issue is due to changing out the operating system rather than a software incompatibility. 
</s><s>meaning, the program thinks you're trying to activate on a new machine because the environment is different...</s><s> but your previous activation is invalid because that setup no longer exists. 
</s><s>ideally, you'd use the help > deactivate menu item before upgrading, to avoid this issue entirely.

<s>technically speaking, there should never be any harm in performing a manual deactivation of an adobe product, because it will free up a slot your two allowed systems that can be reactivated at any time (on the same computer or another). 
</s><s>having a cloned version is fine but that won't have a computer to run and activate on until you restore that image to some machine. 
</s><s>if the hardware or o/s is different after an upgrade, then adobe may sense that as a "new" activation and thus run you out of your count. 
</s><s>requesting that the activation count be reset to zero should not hurt either, because then effectively you will be starting from scratch and choosing which two computers you want to reactivate anew, enter sn, etc.

<s>here's the situation.</s><s> failed hard drive.</s><s> installed new hd.</s><s> installed lion 10.7.x.</s><s> restored system from time machine backup. **** now **** adobe licence error issue, error 150:30 
</s><s>found this solution (detailed below) on another forum (cnet) - not here on adobe systems forum of course - hmmm - tried all the other fixes.</s><s> none worked.</s><s> the one below did work.</s><s> hope this helps anyone dealing with the same issue as me. 
1.</s><s> download the mac license recovery app from here (whcih does not natively run in lion os): http://www.adobe.com/support/contact/licensing_download_eula.html 
2.</s><s> use terminal app (in applications/utilities) to locate and run the "install_fnp.sh" file in "licenserecovery/mac_install_11.6.1" inside the dmg. 
</s><s>note: you'll need to know some basic unix commands to navigate to the folder (i.e. change directory which is "cd folder_name/sub_folder_name/" and "list files" which is "ls" 
3.</s><s> once you are in the folder licenserecovery/mac-install_11.6.1/ you will see a file called "install_fnp.sh" .</s><s> to run a sh file in theterminal app, type "sudo sh install_fnp.sh" 
4.</s><s> enter your password at the sudo warning and the script should take care of the rest. 
5.</s><s> open any cs4 app and your back to work! 
</s><s>again, this is what worked for me so it may not work for you, but the 150:30 tells me that the license service isn't working, odds are because something used to require rosetta to install.

<s>photoshop cs5 was tested on mac os x 10.9 mavericks...</s><s> so it sounds like your validation issue is due to changing out the operating system rather than a software incompatibility.

<s>technically speaking, there should never be any harm in performing a manual deactivation of an adobe product, because it will free up a slot your two allowed systems that can be reactivated at any time (on the same computer or another). 
</s><s>having a cloned version is fine but that won't have a computer to run and activate on until you restore that image to some machine. 
</s><s>if the hardware or o/s is different after an upgrade, then adobe may sense that as a "new" activation and thus run you out of your count. 
</s><s>requesting that the activation count be reset to zero should not hurt either, because then effectively you will be starting from scratch and choosing which two computers you want to reactivate anew, enter sn, etc.

<s>ordinarily, each adobe product can be used by one primary user on up to two computers, although not at the same time... 
</s><s>if you need more users, you can just purchase an adobe volume license (also called a "business" license) for as many seats as you require. 
</s><s>so in your case victor, 10 users would probably qualify you for a volume discount there. 
</s><s>and typically with business licenses you can "downgrade" the software to an older release if you need to, although it goes only one major version back...</s><s> so cs2 would be too far back now - but cs4 would be okay.

<s>ordinarily, each adobe product can be used by one primary user on up to two computers, although not at the same time... 
</s><s>if you need more users, you can just purchase an adobe volume license (also called a "business" license) for as many seats as you require. 
</s><s>so in your case victor, 10 users would probably qualify you for a volume discount there. 
</s><s>and typically with business licenses you can "downgrade" the software to an older release if you need to, although it goes only one major version back...</s><s> so cs2 would be too far back now - but cs4 would be okay.

<s>the application needs write/modify access to the mpr folder deployed by the msi and also to shell32.dll in the system folder during the launching of the application in order to extract the licensing support files.</s><s> assigning rights to the shell32.dll is a bit tricky being it is a protected file and changing the rights to its copy in the dllcache folder doesn't do the trick because the file does not need repair - only the permissions on it change.</s><s> there are several ways one can approach this.</s><s> you could create a run once registry key or a custom action which deletes the initial shell32.ddl and apply the permissions to the one in dllcache and that would ensure self healing.</s><s> however, you'd probably want another custom action to reset the permissions afterwards to leave the file protected after it extracts the licensing files.</s><s> alternatively, although i have not tested this solutions yet, you could package the process during the first time the application launches to the point it presents you with the first licensing screen and include the respective files and registry changes in the vendor's msi, or create a chained msi application object to run after the vendor's.

<s>the application needs write/modify access to the mpr folder deployed by the msi and also to shell32.dll in the system folder during the launching of the application in order to extract the licensing support files.</s><s> assigning rights to the shell32.dll is a bit tricky being it is a protected file and changing the rights to its copy in the dllcache folder doesn't do the trick because the file does not need repair - only the permissions on it change.</s><s> there are several ways one can approach this.</s><s> you could create a run once registry key or a custom action which deletes the initial shell32.ddl and apply the permissions to the one in dllcache and that would ensure self healing.</s><s> however, you'd probably want another custom action to reset the permissions afterwards to leave the file protected after it extracts the licensing files.</s><s> alternatively, although i have not tested this solutions yet, you could package the process during the first time the application launches to the point it presents you with the first licensing screen and include the respective files and registry changes in the vendor's msi, or create a chained msi application object to run after the vendor's.

<s>the exact same problem existed for symantec, leading me to believe that there is more than one connection between the licensing and installation procedures of acrobat and other adobe products and symantec products.</s><s> allowing adobe code to operate outside of a protected environment periodically permits short-term use.</s><s> however, over the space of two weeks (and seven weeks or so for symantec), these programs did not run without licensing problems no matter how many licenses i own.</s><s> i run vista 64 bit, and originally excluded both dep and uac in order to complete the acrobat 8 installation after getting my first epic license error.</s><s> the error did not include until i tried a trial version of cs3.</s><s> i signed off of another forum because i thought i had cured the problem, but am again getting the same epic error due to other factors.</s><s> this should be approached much more directly with adobe, and hopefully some of you have done so.</s><s> unfortunately, the response of symantec support was eventually to give me some of my money back.</s><s> while there are many other security solutions, including some interesting beta solutions, i cannot give up acrobat 8.</s><s> incredibly, despite the fact that these problems are clearly licensing based problems, one response to this issue was that licensing was too complex and most did not understand it.</s><s> i believe that licensing is the bedrock of this problem, and that the software used by two or more software vendors is not doing the right job, violating everyone's licensed rights.

<s>hi, 
</s><s>i downloaded the trial version of photoshop cs4 and ran it ok for about a week.</s><s> then all of a sudden it just crashed and wouldnt open anymore.</s><s> no warnings etc. just wouldnt open. 
</s><s>i'd seen enough of the program so decided i'd buy it and got cs4 extended (student version).</s><s> great stuff i thought.</s><s> uninstalled the trial version and went ahead with loading up the new program.</s><s> all went well with the install, accepted my product key no problems.</s><s> then the dreaded "license has expired" has come up and i'm basically left with a brand new program that does nothing at all sitting on my computer.</s><s> bridge and drive etc work ok - or seem to. 
</s><s>i've had a case opened with adobe for 3 days now and have had no response at all. - not that i'm expecting too much after reading comments on here and around the net.</s><s> seems they have my cash and thats it as far as they're concerned. 
</s><s>luckily i dont have too much important stuff on my laptop and have it all backed up.</s><s> so i'm tempted to be a bit extreme as long as i get some confidence it would work. 
</s><s>i'm presuming that if i format the hard drive (its not partitioned) and reinstall my oem vista (from a dell disk) then there should be no problems with installing cs4 again and getting it to run without all the trouble of it seemingly looking at the wrong key for activation.</s><s> i'm not sure if the oem disk allows me to reformat the complete hard disk prior to loading vista again.</s><s> or whether it will just keep the old stuff on and mess things up again. 
i know the retail versions give you an option of a complete fresh install, but i dont really want to go and buy a copy of vista just to get cs4 to work, and with windows 7 on the horizon. 
</s><s>it might be cheaper to just to a larger hard drive (which i want anyway) and install on that. 
</s><s>any opinions?</s><s> i just really want to get this up and running. 
</s><s>cheers for any help.

<s>i've fixed the solution for this problem dudes.</s><s> i've had the same problem....</s><s> so i started thinking....dreamweaver is using my old bta license instead of the new license i've entered during the install of cs4...</s><s> this is the solution....you set your date backwards (i've set my date at xx/xx/2007).</s><s> then you can launch dreamweaver without the error "license expired"...then you go to help en chose for deactivate product.</s><s> once you've done that....you put your date back to the original date (xx/xx/2009).</s><s> now launch dreamweaver and you'll get a messagebox where you can enter your serial that you've received with a adobe product.

<s>hi, 
</s><s>i downloaded the trial version of photoshop cs4 and ran it ok for about a week.</s><s> then all of a sudden it just crashed and wouldnt open anymore.</s><s> no warnings etc. just wouldnt open. 
</s><s>i'd seen enough of the program so decided i'd buy it and got cs4 extended (student version).</s><s> great stuff i thought.</s><s> uninstalled the trial version and went ahead with loading up the new program.</s><s> all went well with the install, accepted my product key no problems.</s><s> then the dreaded "license has expired" has come up and i'm basically left with a brand new program that does nothing at all sitting on my computer.</s><s> bridge and drive etc work ok - or seem to. 
</s><s>i've had a case opened with adobe for 3 days now and have had no response at all. - not that i'm expecting too much after reading comments on here and around the net.</s><s> seems they have my cash and thats it as far as they're concerned. 
</s><s>luckily i dont have too much important stuff on my laptop and have it all backed up.</s><s> so i'm tempted to be a bit extreme as long as i get some confidence it would work. 
</s><s>i'm presuming that if i format the hard drive (its not partitioned) and reinstall my oem vista (from a dell disk) then there should be no problems with installing cs4 again and getting it to run without all the trouble of it seemingly looking at the wrong key for activation.</s><s> i'm not sure if the oem disk allows me to reformat the complete hard disk prior to loading vista again.</s><s> or whether it will just keep the old stuff on and mess things up again. 
i know the retail versions give you an option of a complete fresh install, but i dont really want to go and buy a copy of vista just to get cs4 to work, and with windows 7 on the horizon. 
</s><s>it might be cheaper to just to a larger hard drive (which i want anyway) and install on that. 
</s><s>any opinions?</s><s> i just really want to get this up and running. 
</s><s>cheers for any help.
