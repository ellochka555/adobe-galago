<subject>Help understand Visual Communicator Live Streaming</subject>
<post author="Macnimation" timestamp="Jun 19, 2011 4:46 AM">
<s>up to know i run live streaming through our steaming server using fms and flash media live encoder as we only needed one camera for live video feeds. 
</s><s>we are looking at the ability now to use 2 live cameras and also the ability to snap in pre recorded video during live feeds and also provide lower third titles. 
i am looking at: 
adobe visual communicator 3 wirecast 4 cutfour 
all of these provide the possible live switching i need. 
</s><s>i'm at the moment looking at the trial version of visual communicator and i am struggling getting my head around a few things. 
i can hook up 2 -3 sony a1 hd cameras in sd no problem and running it though fms is fine.</s><s> during test streams clicking on the cameras using the mini switcher is straight forward. 
howevr i am struggling to work out how to do the following: 
add prerecorded video clips to camera 3?</s><s> ( in the setup tab it says " no camera found - please connect a camera or replace with photo or video clip) how do i replace with a video clip? 
</s><s>how do i add premade titles, so that during the live feed i can put lower third titles in? 
</s><s>finally, how do provide an intro looping video to play before the live feed starts? 
</s><s>any instructions would be appreciated
