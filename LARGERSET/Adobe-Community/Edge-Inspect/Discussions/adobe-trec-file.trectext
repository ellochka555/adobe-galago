<post author="saumishr" timestamp="Feb 19, 2014 3:55 AM">
<s>this problem seems more of the js code issue.</s><s> browsers prevent using caller to get a reference to a strict function, even when accessing caller on a non-strict function.</s><s> they all support getting a reference to a non-strict function via caller (on a non-strict function), just not a strict function.</s><s> even though you are not using strict mode, the function which you are trying to access may be under strict mode.</s><s> workaround can be, either you make your code completely strict compliant or try making the caller accessible by some other means, like passing it by name as an argument.

<s>liz Ê jan 28, 2014Ê |Ê 05:17pm est hi dennis, Ê here is the information from one of our engineers on using edge inspect and typekit: Ê "unfortunately it seems you've run into a situation where edge inspect and typekit don't integrate very well.</s><s> i'll explain a bit more, then offer some suggestions to work around the issue. Ê when you're browsing a local website via the hostname 'localhost', which would not be accessible to any other devices on your network, edge inspect automatically gets your machine's local ip address (which is not the same as the external ip as shown on sites like whatismyip.com) and sends that to the mobile apps.</s><s> for instance, let's say i have a sinatra application running in chrome on my mac as http://localhost:4567.</s><s> my iphone wouldn't be able to understand the hostname "localhost", but it can see my mac using its ip address 10.1.10.1, so edge inspect will navigate to http://10.1.10.1:4567. Ê so, to get fonts working, you could add both 'localhost' and '10.1.10.1' to your kit.</s><s> however, we don't recommend adding local ips to kits because they tend to change without warning.</s><s> (in my example above, the next time i turn on my computer its ip could have changed to 10.1.10.2, but all i would know is that fonts had stopped working on my devices again.</s><s>) Ê to work around this, we recommend using some form of "dynamic dns" - basically, a domain name that is automatically updated with your current ip and therefore will always point to your computer.

<s>edge inspect doesn't do anything different to read the website off your computer than a normal browser does.</s><s> we send a url to the connected devices and expect them to be able to load that address into the webview/uiwebview components in the edge inspect app on the devices.the reason you're seeing an issue with edge inspect and your http://foobar.dev site is the same reason why you wouldn't/shouldn't expect to type that url into a browser on another machine and be able to view the website... there's no external dns server to talk to that knows where that address is actually located.

i set up my domains as "http://foobar.dev" (where '.dev' is the tld on my localhost for things ... local). 
i can view any public internet sites, and they will show up on edge inspect on my phone, with no problem. 
</s><s>i've tested this with turning off the firewall on my computer...</s><s> (but i'm surprised thats how edge works, but what ever).

<s>edge inspect doesn't do anything different to read the website off your computer than a normal browser does.</s><s> we send a url to the connected devices and expect them to be able to load that address into the webview/uiwebview components in the edge inspect app on the devices.the reason you're seeing an issue with edge inspect and your http://foobar.dev site is the same reason why you wouldn't/shouldn't expect to type that url into a browser on another machine and be able to view the website... there's no external dns server to talk to that knows where that address is actually located. 
</s><s>so, edge inspect might be doing less than you thought is was in those terms.</s><s> the main focus of edge inspect really is: 1.</s><s> managing the connection from your computer to multiple connected devices 2.</s><s> translating localhost, 127.0.0.1, and <machinename>.local urls 3.</s><s> keeping multiple devices in sync 4.</s><s> simplifying things like cache clearing and screenshots on all your devices 5.</s><s> providing a simple interface into weinre for remote inspection

<subject>WORKAROUND/POSSIBLE SOLUTION: Chrome 30 for Mac and Edge Inspect CC sec-WebSocket-Protocol error</subject>
<post author="ArnoldD" timestamp="Oct 2, 2013 7:19 PM">
<s>i came across this thread (how to solve the sec-websocket-protocol error in chrome 30.0.1599.66 m) and applying the same edit to the inspect.js file for the edge inspect chrome extension solved the websocket error immediately, the issue most of us have been experiencing with the latest chrome version: 30.0.1599.66. we couldn't revert back to chrome 29 (latest known version working with edge inspect) because we couldn't find it, but in any case chrome will auto-update to version 30. 
</s><s>my system info: osx 10.7.5, chrome extension adobe edge inspect cc 1.0.424.1, adobe edge inspect cc 1.0.407, chrome 30.0.1599.66 
</s><s>disclaimer: this steps will modify the adobe chrome extension as installed from the chrome web store.</s><s> i will not be held responsible for any other issues this may cause.</s><s> i'm just reporting a fix that immediately worked for me.</s><s> i'm assuming you can always remove the extension from chrome and reinstall from the store. 
</s><s>step 1: disable edge inspect chrome extension browse to chrome://extensions and uncheck/disable adobe edge inspect cc 1.0.424.1 
</s><s>step 2: browse to the inspect.js file in finder, cmd-shift-g or from the menu bar go > go to folder...</s><s> copy/paste ~/library/application support/google/chrome/default/extensions/ijoeapleklopieoejahbpdnhkjjgddem/1.0.424.1_0/js/ 
</s><s>step 3: edit inspect.js file select inspect.js and edit it any text editor (textedit, textwrangler, or even edge code cc) on line 61 look for the following code: this._wshandle = new websocket(this._protocol + "://" + this._host + ":" + this._port + "/", "shadow"); edit the line to remove , "shadow" (note the comma and space is also to be removed).</s><s> so you're resulting code should be: this._wshandle = new websocket(this._protocol + "://" + this._host + ":" + this._port + "/"); save changes 
step 4: enable edge inspect chrome extension browse to chrome://extensions and check/enable adobe edge inspect cc 1.0.424.1 the icon in your toolbar should change immediately from grayed out to full color brown and everything should function as usual 
again, i'm not sure if this is the ultimate fix, but at least edge inspect works again until the chrome extension is fixed or chrome changes the way websockets are handled. 
</s><s>hope this helps!</s><s>!</s><s>

<s>fwiw, you can fire up your own weinre server (the app behind edge inspect), but it's a bit involved. http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre/docs/latest/

<s>if the chrome extension icon is gray, that means that either the edge inspect desktop application isn't running or the chrome extension can't talk to it for some reason.

<s>no change.</s><s> changes in the file are in bold and italics.

# # serverroot: the top of the directory tree under which the server's # configuration, error, and log files are kept. # # do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.</s><s> if you point # serverroot at a non-local disk, be sure to point the lockfile directive # at a local disk.</s><s> if you wish to share the same serverroot for multiple # httpd daemons, you will need to change at least lockfile and pidfile. # serverroot "c:/wamp/bin/apache/apache2.2.17" 

# # listen: allows you to bind apache to specific ip addresses and/or # ports, instead of the default.</s><s> see also the <virtualhost> # directive. # # change this to listen on specific ip addresses as shown below to # prevent apache from glomming onto all bound ip addresses. # #listen 12.34.56.78:80 #listen 80 listen 0.0.0.0:80

<s>hi bartl, 
edge inspect needs the site to be served through a web server for a number of reasons, but primarily because that allows an external computer to access the files in a way that doesn't compromise machine security.</s><s> to view local pages you can set up a web server like mamp/wamp or web sharing on ios, so you don't need upload your files to a web server elsewhere.</s><s> inspect understands localhost and 1270.0.1 urls and the connected devices will translate those so you don't need to set up a virtual host name. 
</s><s>you're right, edge inspect doesn't provide web hosting as a feature, and it's not intended to.</s><s> the primary features of edge inspect are: synchronous browsing - so if you have multiple devices connected you don't need to browse/refresh on each individually connection management - so that devices connect quickly and easily and (attempt to) remain connected to your computer screenshots - take individual or multiple screenshots simultaneously with a single click and without needing to root the device remote inspection - inspect the dom of the remote device on your computer via weinre

<s>hi sbhogal, 
</s><s>are you using a local server while working with dreamweaver (something like mamp)?</s><s> if not then inspect won't be able to see your project.</s><s> the devices using inspect have to have access to the file you're trying to preview and if that file is just on your filesystem (eg, shows something like file:\\\ in the url bar in chrome) or if it's using localhost (http://localhost or maybe http://127.0.01 in the url bar) the devices can't see it. 
</s><s>you could try setting up a mamp server or we also have edge inspect support with edge code so you can preview your project on mobile devices.

<s>hi sbhogal, 
</s><s>are you using a local server while working with dreamweaver (something like mamp)?</s><s> if not then inspect won't be able to see your project.</s><s> the devices using inspect have to have access to the file you're trying to preview and if that file is just on your filesystem (eg, shows something like file:\\\ in the url bar in chrome) or if it's using localhost (http://localhost or maybe http://127.0.01 in the url bar) the devices can't see it. 
</s><s>you could try setting up a mamp server or we also have edge inspect support with edge code so you can preview your project on mobile devices. 
</s><s>hope that helps,

<s>hi alistair, 
</s><s>i'm not entirely sure if you're referring to safari on your computer or safari on your ipad, so i'll answer for both: 
if you meant safari on your computer, the answer is no. but since we just released the edge inspect api (http://blogs.adobe.com/edgeinspect/2013/06/18/introducing-the-edge-ins pect-javascript-api/) that's something you can do yourself if you'd prefer to test from safari.</s><s> as far as that being a better test bed, the browser you're testing from really doesn't make a difference for how the pages will appear on your devices.</s><s> we simply send the url from the browser to the devices, rather than sending the page contents, so all rendering is controlled by the device.</s><s> if you meant safari on your ipad, well, the answer is also no, but for a different reason.</s><s> we're making use of the uiwebview component because by embedding that component in our application we have much greater control over it and can implement customizations like screenshots, remote inspect, cache clearing, and things like that to make edge inspect more fully featured.</s><s> uiwebview and safari are both based on webkit, and we've configured the uiwebview component to behave as much like safari as possible.</s><s> at this point in time we know of no rendering differences between the two, the only differences we're aware of are performance-related...</s><s> safari is faster than the uiwebview component.</s><s> since we'd essentially need to cripple/remove a number of features to make edge inspect work with safari, there are no plans to make that happen. 
</s><s>hope this helps, mark

<s>hi alistair, 
</s><s>i'm not entirely sure if you're referring to safari on your computer or safari on your ipad, so i'll answer for both: 
if you meant safari on your computer, the answer is no. but since we just released the edge inspect api (http://blogs.adobe.com/edgeinspect/2013/06/18/introducing-the-edge-ins pect-javascript-api/) that's something you can do yourself if you'd prefer to test from safari.</s><s> as far as that being a better test bed, the browser you're testing from really doesn't make a difference for how the pages will appear on your devices.</s><s> we simply send the url from the browser to the devices, rather than sending the page contents, so all rendering is controlled by the device.</s><s> if you meant safari on your ipad, well, the answer is also no, but for a different reason.</s><s> we're making use of the uiwebview component because by embedding that component in our application we have much greater control over it and can implement customizations like screenshots, remote inspect, cache clearing, and things like that to make edge inspect more fully featured.</s><s> uiwebview and safari are both based on webkit, and we've configured the uiwebview component to behave as much like safari as possible.</s><s> at this point in time we know of no rendering differences between the two, the only differences we're aware of are performance-related...</s><s> safari is faster than the uiwebview component.</s><s> since we'd essentially need to cripple/remove a number of features to make edge inspect work with safari, there are no plans to make that happen. 
</s><s>hope this helps, mark

<s>thanks.</s><s> i'm not sure what's going on there. 
a couple more questions: can you try browsing in chrome to a public site like http://www.google.com and see if your device can remote inspect that page?</s><s> if not, check for any firewall software, and try turning that off temporarily.</s><s> does that makes any difference with a public site?</s><s> if you're testing a local page that you can edit, try taking edge inspect out of the loop and see if that changes anything...</s><s> put this script tag into your web page: <script src="http://debug.edgeinspect.adobe.com/target/target-script-min.js#lukyano v"></script> reload the page in chrome.</s><s> in a new browser tab/window go to http://debug.edgeinspect.adobe.com/client/#lukyanov does that get you a working weinre window?</s><s> if so, load the page in the native browser on your device (you'll need to use your computer's ip address instead of localhost) and on your computer refresh the /client#moretti window 
if none of that works for you, i have one more possible workaround for you, but try those things first and tell me what happened with each.

<s>my last suggestion was running your own weinre server, which you say you've done.</s><s> we know of no reason why this shouldn't work... there must be some machine or network configuration that's preventing the communication.

<s>hi rafael, 
</s><s>this thread is about people having problems with their connected devices being unable to connect to weinre for remote inspection.</s><s> it sounds like you're having problems with getting a basic connection going... something entirely different.</s><s> we don't know of any issues with getting a 3gs connected to your computer with edge inspect.</s><s> that said, connection problems can generally be solved by following these steps: 
make sure your computer and your devices are connected to the same network.</s><s> make sure your computer is not on vpn since that will block other external connections.</s><s> temporarily turn off any firewall software on your computer.</s><s> (once you get connected you can re-enable the firewall and then add an exception for edge inspect) make sure that port 7682 is not being used by anything on your computer and that your network doesn't block communications across that port.</s><s> generally this isn't a problem on a home network, but can be a problem in corporate network environments.</s><s> if you're on a corporate network, also make sure that your computer and your device are on the same subnetwork or that communication on port 7682 is allowed across subnets... talk to your it department about that.</s><s> enter the ip address of your computer in the manual connection screen.</s><s> enter only the ip address without any protocol.</s><s> click the connect button and let me know if you see any error messages in that screen. 
</s><s>try that and let me know if you're able to get a connection.

<subject>WORKAROUND/POSSIBLE SOLUTION: Chrome 30 for Mac and Edge Inspect CC sec-WebSocket-Protocol error</subject>
<post author="ArnoldD" timestamp="Oct 2, 2013 7:19 PM">
<s>i came across this thread (how to solve the sec-websocket-protocol error in chrome 30.0.1599.66 m) and applying the same edit to the inspect.js file for the edge inspect chrome extension solved the websocket error immediately, the issue most of us have been experiencing with the latest chrome version: 30.0.1599.66. we couldn't revert back to chrome 29 (latest known version working with edge inspect) because we couldn't find it, but in any case chrome will auto-update to version 30. 
</s><s>my system info: osx 10.7.5, chrome extension adobe edge inspect cc 1.0.424.1, adobe edge inspect cc 1.0.407, chrome 30.0.1599.66 
</s><s>disclaimer: this steps will modify the adobe chrome extension as installed from the chrome web store.</s><s> i will not be held responsible for any other issues this may cause.</s><s> i'm just reporting a fix that immediately worked for me.</s><s> i'm assuming you can always remove the extension from chrome and reinstall from the store. 
</s><s>step 1: disable edge inspect chrome extension browse to chrome://extensions and uncheck/disable adobe edge inspect cc 1.0.424.1 
</s><s>step 2: browse to the inspect.js file in finder, cmd-shift-g or from the menu bar go > go to folder...</s><s> copy/paste ~/library/application support/google/chrome/default/extensions/ijoeapleklopieoejahbpdnhkjjgddem/1.0.424.1_0/js/ 
</s><s>step 3: edit inspect.js file select inspect.js and edit it any text editor (textedit, textwrangler, or even edge code cc) on line 61 look for the following code: this._wshandle = new websocket(this._protocol + "://" + this._host + ":" + this._port + "/", "shadow"); edit the line to remove , "shadow" (note the comma and space is also to be removed).</s><s> so you're resulting code should be: this._wshandle = new websocket(this._protocol + "://" + this._host + ":" + this._port + "/"); save changes 
step 4: enable edge inspect chrome extension browse to chrome://extensions and check/enable adobe edge inspect cc 1.0.424.1 the icon in your toolbar should change immediately from grayed out to full color brown and everything should function as usual 
again, i'm not sure if this is the ultimate fix, but at least edge inspect works again until the chrome extension is fixed or chrome changes the way websockets are handled. 
</s><s>hope this helps!</s><s>!</s><s>

<s>fwiw, you can fire up your own weinre server (the app behind edge inspect), but it's a bit involved. http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre/docs/latest/

<s>it's possible but the networks where the devices/desktop are should be able to communicate with each other across port 7682.
