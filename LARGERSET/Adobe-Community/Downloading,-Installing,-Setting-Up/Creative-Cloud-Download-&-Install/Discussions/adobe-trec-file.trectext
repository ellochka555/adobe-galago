</s><s>jeff, 
</s><s>it appears that the process has already become more integrated. 
</s><s>when i sat down at my computer just now the cc icon in the menu bar was blue.</s><s> i had to login to cc again, but then the apps shown in this screengrab all had an update button.</s><s> i just updated illustrator (directly from within cc) and at no stage was prompted to use the aam ui (i understand it might still provide the underlying infrastructure). 
</s><s>clicking on the aam icon now takes one directly to the cc ui shown in the screengrab.</s><s> i would have expected this update to automatically remove the aam/adobe icon from the menu bar - which i can no longer even achieve manually, as i can't get to the existing preferences panel within aam - so i'm left with a redundant icon permanently in my menu bar.</s><s> but otherwise the process now seems pretty self-evident.

<s>puffmoike, 
</s><s>lightroom assuming cc desktop app is meant to be my central (and only) adobe app installer and manager should i uninstall lr5 using the process outlined above and then reinstall it using cc desktop app? 
[pete] i don't see the need to do this really.</s><s> if you want to you can, but they're the same application.</s><s> i'd stick with what you already have installed.

</s><s>cool.</s><s> 
</s><s>so assuming pete and jeff are on the same page is the basic advice to: use the cc desktop app to monitor the update status of the remainder of my adobe apps, and simply keep an ear to the ground for any updates to lr and update lr from within the app itself (help / check for updates-)?

</s><s>jeff, was 'can safely ignore' intended to mean that i can choose to ignore aam, or that i should ignore aam?</s><s> if an update is shown to be available via the aam icon in osx's menubar is a user meant to use aam or cc desktop to update the apps?</s><s> and if the update status of the 'production' apps is at odds in the 'management' apps (as it currently is on my computer) which should i trust? 
</s><s>is aam now simply an app which is intended to work in the background (and hence should i uncheck 'notify me of new updates on the menu bar' setting in preferences)?</s><s> is that is something that will happen down the road, but isn't ready yet? 
</s><s>sorry for all the questions -- which i appreciate are veering a little into the academic rather than being strictly necessary (i can at least use my production apps at the moment) -- but i'm just surprised how confusing this all is.</s><s> and i don't imagine i'm the only person who is confused. 
</s><s>the creative clud desktop help page makes no mention of aam, and the install and update apps help page only seems to add to, rather than clear up, the confusion about how the two managment apps are meant to work together.

<s>puffmoike from your perspective you don't need to be concerned with the adobe application manager.</s><s> you will still want to apply any updates you are notified of when it is convenient to you.</s><s> for the moment these updates will still appear as an adobe icon and launch the update component of aam. 
</s><s>in the future this process will become more integrated and the ui for applying the updates will be moved into the creative cloud application.</s><s> the same components will still be working behind the scenes to deliver an install the updates to you.

</s><s>jeff, 
</s><s>it appears that the process has already become more integrated. 
</s><s>when i sat down at my computer just now the cc icon in the menu bar was blue.</s><s> i had to login to cc again, but then the apps shown in this screengrab all had an update button.</s><s> i just updated illustrator (directly from within cc) and at no stage was prompted to use the aam ui (i understand it might still provide the underlying infrastructure). 
</s><s>clicking on the aam icon now takes one directly to the cc ui shown in the screengrab.</s><s> i would have expected this update to automatically remove the aam/adobe icon from the menu bar - which i can no longer even achieve manually, as i can't get to the existing preferences panel within aam - so i'm left with a redundant icon permanently in my menu bar.</s><s> but otherwise the process now seems pretty self-evident.

<s>okay, two weeks in i am basically back where i started.

<s>hey everybody, i am using a student version of the creative cloud, and every couple of minutes (5-10 minutes) the creative cloud logs me off.</s><s> so every time i want to start a programm i have to log in again, every time i get the software notification "trial: 0 days" and every time i have to log in on the creative cloud software, wait 2-3 minutes and then start photoshop or whatever.</s><s> then i always have to accept the license aggreements (i think i have accepted them about 15 times in the last 30 minutes.</s><s>) and sometimes i get a "creative cloud now licensed for the user: *my email*".</s><s> how can i fix that?</s><s>?</s><s> it is really annoying...

this thought just occurred to me: i have a fuilly licensed version of cs6 prod stuio premium on my home workstation.</s><s> i'm currently engaged to edit a project using ppro/cc at another location.</s><s> in order to edit from home, i'm considering adding cc to my home worksation, however i presently have a trial version of a ppro plugin (boris graffiti) that is still active, i.e. the "trial expiration date" has not yet passed. 
</s><s>my questions: 1) will my trial plug-in work in both cs6 and cc upon installing cc?</s><s> 2) if i join/install cc today, could the setting for my trial plug-in affect me in such a way that i'll be suffering the incessant registration issue?</s><s> 3) might an active or "expired-but-resident" trial of other software be a contributor to - or cause of - the repeated re-registration issue?

<post author="puffmoike" timestamp="Jun 10, 2013 6:03 PM">
<s>i have been using cs6 apps as part of a creative cloud subscription since not long after cc was released.</s><s> i have only installed the apps as part of cc.

</s><s>the only two apps which show up as installed are ae (which i downloaded a month or two ago) & lr5 (which i downloaded yesterday) and even that shows a grey 'installation complete launch app' message when i've already been using it.

<s>well the week has passed and the situation remains roughly the same.</s><s> but with a twist, which i'll discuss first before returning to the more obviously directly related issue flowing from my earlier questions.

<quote>
<s>adobe application manager is automatically updated to adobe creative cloud desktop app on mac os x 10.7 or later, and windows 7 or later.

</s><s>i'm confused.</s><s> surely cc desktop app is intended to replace aam. 
</s><s>however whilst the cc desktop shows the new cc versions of ai, ps, id, ae and updated edge inspect apps (and the previous cs6 versions of all but ae) as up to date aam says updates are available for the cc versions of ai, ps & id, as well as dps desktop tools cc and ps camera raw 8. 
</s><s>should i simply ignore aam from this point forward?</s><s> should i uninstall it (and if so how, i don't see any reference to it in application/utilities/adobe installers)? 
</s><s>lightroom assuming cc desktop app is meant to be my central (and only) adobe app installer and manager should i uninstall lr5 using the process outlined above and then reinstall it using cc desktop app? 
</s><s>and if so will the new version of lr5 recognise my existing lr database (and is there anything i should do in preparation to ensure i don't have any problems)?

<s>puffmoike from your perspective you don't need to be concerned with the adobe application manager.</s><s> you will still want to apply any updates you are notified of when it is convenient to you.</s><s> for the moment these updates will still appear as an adobe icon and launch the update component of aam.

</s><s>jeff, 
</s><s>it appears that the process has already become more integrated. 
</s><s>when i sat down at my computer just now the cc icon in the menu bar was blue.</s><s> i had to login to cc again, but then the apps shown in this screengrab all had an update button.</s><s> i just updated illustrator (directly from within cc) and at no stage was prompted to use the aam ui (i understand it might still provide the underlying infrastructure). 
</s><s>clicking on the aam icon now takes one directly to the cc ui shown in the screengrab.</s><s> i would have expected this update to automatically remove the aam/adobe icon from the menu bar - which i can no longer even achieve manually, as i can't get to the existing preferences panel within aam - so i'm left with a redundant icon permanently in my menu bar.</s><s> but otherwise the process now seems pretty self-evident.

<s>jeff, to be clear i have successfully downloaded, installed and use all the apps i've discussed. 
</s><s>all the apps work just fine (on a late-2009 imac with 32gb of ram running os 10.8.3).</s><s> the only thing that is wonky is aap.</s><s> initially the links next to the listed apps suggested that i had only installed ae and lr and not apps like ps, id, ai and acrobat which i use every day.

<s>well the week has passed and the situation remains roughly the same.</s><s> but with a twist, which i'll discuss first before returning to the more obviously directly related issue flowing from my earlier questions. 
</s><s>cc desktop app and aam now in my mac's menubar i have icons for both aam and the new creative cloud desktop app.</s><s> i've just had a quick look at the install and update apps help page which says: 
<quote>
<s>adobe application manager is automatically updated to adobe creative cloud desktop app on mac os x 10.7 or later, and windows 7 or later. 
</s></quote>
</s><s>i'm confused.</s><s> surely cc desktop app is intended to replace aam. 
</s><s>however whilst the cc desktop shows the new cc versions of ai, ps, id, ae and updated edge inspect apps (and the previous cs6 versions of all but ae) as up to date aam says updates are available for the cc versions of ai, ps & id, as well as dps desktop tools cc and ps camera raw 8. 
</s><s>should i simply ignore aam from this point forward?</s><s> should i uninstall it (and if so how, i don't see any reference to it in application/utilities/adobe installers)? 
</s><s>lightroom assuming cc desktop app is meant to be my central (and only) adobe app installer and manager should i uninstall lr5 using the process outlined above and then reinstall it using cc desktop app? 
</s><s>and if so will the new version of lr5 recognise my existing lr database (and is there anything i should do in preparation to ensure i don't have any problems)?

<s>puffmoike from your perspective you don't need to be concerned with the adobe application manager.</s><s> you will still want to apply any updates you are notified of when it is convenient to you.</s><s> for the moment these updates will still appear as an adobe icon and launch the update component of aam.

</s><s>jeff, 
</s><s>it appears that the process has already become more integrated. 
</s><s>when i sat down at my computer just now the cc icon in the menu bar was blue.</s><s> i had to login to cc again, but then the apps shown in this screengrab all had an update button.</s><s> i just updated illustrator (directly from within cc) and at no stage was prompted to use the aam ui (i understand it might still provide the underlying infrastructure). 
</s><s>clicking on the aam icon now takes one directly to the cc ui shown in the screengrab.</s><s> i would have expected this update to automatically remove the aam/adobe icon from the menu bar - which i can no longer even achieve manually, as i can't get to the existing preferences panel within aam - so i'm left with a redundant icon permanently in my menu bar.</s><s> but otherwise the process now seems pretty self-evident.

<s>jeff, 
</s><s>here is a concern i have.</s><s> i called sales support yesterday and asked the following questions.</s><s> i have 3 computers (1) pc tower, (1) imac and (1) macbook pro.</s><s> when i first started using adobe all the way through cs5 master collection i always owned the windows box versions.</s><s> i have been waiting for months for this to come out so i could move my workflow over to macos x. since the creative cloud supports both mac and windows installs the question i asked was can i install it on both my 2 mac computers.</s><s> then if i need to use it on my pc can i simply deactivate and then activate on it for use? 
</s><s>the answer your support person gave was "yes" so the answer in this topic don't even flow with the answers from calling the 800 number! 
</s><s>so now reading this forum topic i am really confused.</s><s> i like many others have definate reasons why i may want to flip flop the machine i am using the software on (1) i have $4500 worth of ae plug-ins. $2000 worth of these are platform specific.</s><s> so they only run on a windows machine.</s><s> even, though i intend on my primary workflow to be used on a mac there may come a time when i need to use one of these plug-ins and then would have to switch my activation to the pc to use it. 
</s><s>another scenario, let's face it apple has not been to keen on upgrading the mac pro system's. imac's are great but have their limitations with graphics cards, drives, and memory.</s><s> so if you go a complicated ae render to do,iit makes a lot more sense to run it on a pc at this time for me.</s><s> so my hope here is i would de-activate one of my mac's activate my pc then render away. 
i like many others completely understand that we are only suppose to operate our software on 1 machine at a time.</s><s> i am cool with you checking this.</s><s> other posters have asked what if i forget to turn one machine off leave with my macbook pro and then fire it up.</s><s> will i be in trouble?</s><s> not sure how you handle this if you don't have a connection.</s><s> but spotify the music streaming company license their software to me the user.</s><s> if i fire up one machine, then grab my iphone and try to listen it turns it off on the other machine.</s><s> apps in the app store like motionx drive do the same thing. 
i am an electrical automation engineer by day and a graphic/video designer enthusiast at night.</s><s> in all the programming software that every vendor provides they provide a licensing server software service that sits locally within the location.</s><s> it manages concurrent licenses, without the need for online connections.</s><s> any computer needing to run simply pulls the license from the network connected license server software service.</s><s> when the program is done it releases the license.</s><s> the only issues with this is if your license server crashes.</s><s> it can be a bit of a headache with support to get your license back.</s><s> others simply have an online site (like apple) where you simply log in and de-activate devices as needed.</s><s> (heck even hulu, and netflix offer this.</s><s>) 
</s><s>i think if adobe wants the cloud thing to take off then they need to re-evaluate this.</s><s> the license needs to follow the user not the device.</s><s> the user should have a painless simple way to activate and de-activate their license back to their adobe id.

<s>@daryl barnes you should be fine as you are still complying with eula 
@smakelaien are you and another individual using the applications on two separate computers?</s><s> that would be one of the definitions of utilizing the software at the same time by multiple individuals. 
@jon vital you should be just fine.</s><s> if you run into a problem, much like has been the same since creative suite 2, simply contact our support team. 
@robdma01 if you were able to get that solution to work with previous creative suite applications then maybe.</s><s> i don't see how such a solution would have worked with our applications previously as they have to many shared components to lend themselves to being installed as a portable application.</s><s> if you have additional inquires on this though i would recommend posting to another thread as trying to install creative cloud as a portable application is a seperate topic.

<s>jeff, 
</s><s>here is a concern i have.</s><s> i called sales support yesterday and asked the following questions.</s><s> i have 3 computers (1) pc tower, (1) imac and (1) macbook pro.</s><s> when i first started using adobe all the way through cs5 master collection i always owned the windows box versions.</s><s> i have been waiting for months for this to come out so i could move my workflow over to macos x. since the creative cloud supports both mac and windows installs the question i asked was can i install it on both my 2 mac computers.</s><s> then if i need to use it on my pc can i simply deactivate and then activate on it for use? 
</s><s>the answer your support person gave was "yes" so the answer in this topic don't even flow with the answers from calling the 800 number! 
</s><s>so now reading this forum topic i am really confused.</s><s> i like many others have definate reasons why i may want to flip flop the machine i am using the software on (1) i have $4500 worth of ae plug-ins. $2000 worth of these are platform specific.</s><s> so they only run on a windows machine.</s><s> even, though i intend on my primary workflow to be used on a mac there may come a time when i need to use one of these plug-ins and then would have to switch my activation to the pc to use it. 
</s><s>another scenario, let's face it apple has not been to keen on upgrading the mac pro system's. imac's are great but have their limitations with graphics cards, drives, and memory.</s><s> so if you go a complicated ae render to do,iit makes a lot more sense to run it on a pc at this time for me.</s><s> so my hope here is i would de-activate one of my mac's activate my pc then render away. 
i like many others completely understand that we are only suppose to operate our software on 1 machine at a time.</s><s> i am cool with you checking this.</s><s> other posters have asked what if i forget to turn one machine off leave with my macbook pro and then fire it up.</s><s> will i be in trouble?</s><s> not sure how you handle this if you don't have a connection.</s><s> but spotify the music streaming company license their software to me the user.</s><s> if i fire up one machine, then grab my iphone and try to listen it turns it off on the other machine.</s><s> apps in the app store like motionx drive do the same thing. 
i am an electrical automation engineer by day and a graphic/video designer enthusiast at night.</s><s> in all the programming software that every vendor provides they provide a licensing server software service that sits locally within the location.</s><s> it manages concurrent licenses, without the need for online connections.</s><s> any computer needing to run simply pulls the license from the network connected license server software service.</s><s> when the program is done it releases the license.</s><s> the only issues with this is if your license server crashes.</s><s> it can be a bit of a headache with support to get your license back.</s><s> others simply have an online site (like apple) where you simply log in and de-activate devices as needed.</s><s> (heck even hulu, and netflix offer this.</s><s>) 
</s><s>i think if adobe wants the cloud thing to take off then they need to re-evaluate this.</s><s> the license needs to follow the user not the device.</s><s> the user should have a painless simple way to activate and de-activate their license back to their adobe id.

<s>@daryl barnes you should be fine as you are still complying with eula 
@smakelaien are you and another individual using the applications on two separate computers?</s><s> that would be one of the definitions of utilizing the software at the same time by multiple individuals. 
@jon vital you should be just fine.</s><s> if you run into a problem, much like has been the same since creative suite 2, simply contact our support team. 
@robdma01 if you were able to get that solution to work with previous creative suite applications then maybe.</s><s> i don't see how such a solution would have worked with our applications previously as they have to many shared components to lend themselves to being installed as a portable application.</s><s> if you have additional inquires on this though i would recommend posting to another thread as trying to install creative cloud as a portable application is a seperate topic.

<s>i had the same problem in windows 8 on my macbook pro for a while.</s><s> i tried everything has been told on website but nothing worked. 
</s><s>today i finally had a different message saying cloud can not activate your account, 
so what i did is step by step; - disconnected the ethernet cable from the broadband - connected my iphone and joined it's hotspot connection - closed the trial - login screen for photoshop - re-opened and clicked not my id - re-entered user name and password - it worked! 
</s><s>the only thing i can think of this "solution" is could be the router's firewall or dns settings are blocking the connection for the application manager, well maybe, i'm an artist and no idea about these it stuff, so lucky me.

<s>this "mac: 1.</s><s> please click on "go" and navigate to /private/etc 2.</s><s> open "hosts" file and check out for any entries for adobe.com 3.</s><s> remove the entries and save the file 4. try again launching any product from cs6 
and this: "the first thing i opened was acrobat and it asked for a serial number.</s><s> then i opened aftereffects and it connected properly.</s><s> after that i could open everything without it asking for the serial number.</s><s> so it doesn't need the serial number in fact.</s><s> if you get the warning just try opening a different application until it connects and then go back to the other application and try again." 
and this: i found this tool on their website to remove previous adobe creative suites but it also enables you to remove the creative cloud application manager. http://www.adobe.com/support/contact/cscleanertool.html 
when you start it up you need to choose all on the top.</s><s> it will show application manager and remove that application.</s><s> afterwards go back to the creative cloud login page

<s>i had the same problem in windows 8 on my macbook pro for a while.</s><s> i tried everything has been told on website but nothing worked. 
</s><s>today i finally had a different message saying cloud can not activate your account,
