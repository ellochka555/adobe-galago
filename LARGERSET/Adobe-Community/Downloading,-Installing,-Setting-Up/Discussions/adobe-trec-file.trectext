<subject>Successfully Installing & Activating CS6 (not Creative Cloud) behind an Authentication Proxy server</subject>
<post author="gps03" timestamp="Nov 28, 2012 11:18 AM">
<s>if you are like me and work in a fairly secure office where all internet access is routed through an authenticate proxy server (you have to use an id and password to get to the internet) you might have noticed that installing cs6 products can be difficult. 
</s><s>the installer told me to go to http://www.adobe.com/go/getactivated for an offline activation.</s><s> it is not practical to "disable the firewall" or"disable the proxy" as most of us worker bees have neither the authority or ability to do such a thing. 
</s><s>so back to that last bit: "disable the proxy server." well i could not do that, but i could disable my pc's ability to connect to the proxy and therefore make it seem like i had no internet whatsoever.</s><s> and lo and behold all the right prompts appeared and offline activation sailed along smoothly! 
</s><s>this is a little long, but i wanted to include lots of screen shots so you'll know what to expect. 
</s><s>here's how i did it: 
</s><s>1. right-click the internet explorer icon on your desktop (or select tools > internet options in ie) 2. click properties. 
3. select the connections card.</s><s> 4. click lan settings.</s><s> 
</s><s>5. uncheck any boxes (you might want to write down what was in the boxes or grab a screen shot as you'll have to put this back to how you found it later to restore your internet access).</s><s> click ok and ok again.</s><s> you've now shut off ie's ability to hit your proxy server and therefore the internet. 
6.</s><s> click install i have a serial number 
7.</s><s> accept the license agreement. 
8.</s><s> enter your license key.</s><s> 9. click next.</s><s> at this point the installer will attempt to validate your license, but since you haven't got internet access, it will give you an error.</s><s> this is where the process broke down on me, when the installer could detect the internet but not navigate my proxy. 


10.</s><s> but, now beacuse you do not have internet access, you'll get this error.</s><s> click connect later.</s><s> 
</s><s>11. select your customizations (if any) and click install. 
12. when installation is complete, click launch now. 
13. you'll get an error since you don't have internet, click "having trouble connecting to the internet?" 
14. click offline activation. 
15. click generate request code. 
16. go to http://www.adobe.com/go/getactivated, sign in, put in your request code and serial number and generate the response code.* 17. enter the response code.</s><s> 18. click activate.</s><s> 
</s><s>19. click launch when you get the offline activation complete dialog. 

* if you are installing more than one product, generate the response codes for each at the same time.</s><s> i ran into an issue where once i created a response code, no other response codes i created for subsequent installs were accepted.</s><s> i had to wait 24 hours for a newly generated code to work. 
</s><s>you are done!</s><s> enjoy your software! 
</s><s>cheers! -greg

<s>just want to point out--after many hours of attempting to activate cs6 software (stumping two adobe techs in the process)--that there is one important bit of information left out of the directions given above (and it's not in the video either): 
these instructions work only if you are starting the installation from scratch.</s><s> if you (mistakenly) think that your inability to connect to adobe's activation server is temporary and go ahead and install the software, you will not be able to get back to the screen to generate a request code (which you need to be able to activate the application).</s><s> this is in spite of adobe's assurance to the contrary that if you don't activate during installation, you can do it later when the application starts.</s><s> if you try to activate later, you are taken to an online screen that asks for the "request code"--but you have not been given an opportunity to get that request code. 
</s><s>the only solution i could find: i had to uninstall photoshop cs6, then unplug my internet connection, then reinstall the software, watching carefully for the screen that provides the button to generate a request code.</s><s> if adobe is going to require the activation/validation procedure, then it really needs to make it work and correct the error in the software, namely, the failure to provide for offline activation once the software has been installed.

<s>if you are like me and work in a fairly secure office where all internet access is routed through an authenticate proxy server (you have to use an id and password to get to the internet) you might have noticed that installing cs6 products can be difficult. 
</s><s>the installer told me to go to http://www.adobe.com/go/getactivated for an offline activation.</s><s> it is not practical to "disable the firewall" or"disable the proxy" as most of us worker bees have neither the authority or ability to do such a thing. 
</s><s>so back to that last bit: "disable the proxy server." well i could not do that, but i could disable my pc's ability to connect to the proxy and therefore make it seem like i had no internet whatsoever.</s><s> and lo and behold all the right prompts appeared and offline activation sailed along smoothly! 
</s><s>this is a little long, but i wanted to include lots of screen shots so you'll know what to expect. 
</s><s>here's how i did it: 
</s><s>1. right-click the internet explorer icon on your desktop (or select tools > internet options in ie) 2. click properties. 
3. select the connections card.</s><s> 4. click lan settings.</s><s> 
</s><s>5. uncheck any boxes (you might want to write down what was in the boxes or grab a screen shot as you'll have to put this back to how you found it later to restore your internet access).</s><s> click ok and ok again.</s><s> you've now shut off ie's ability to hit your proxy server and therefore the internet. 
6.</s><s> click install i have a serial number 
7.</s><s> accept the license agreement. 
8.</s><s> enter your license key.</s><s> 9. click next.</s><s> at this point the installer will attempt to validate your license, but since you haven't got internet access, it will give you an error.</s><s> this is where the process broke down on me, when the installer could detect the internet but not navigate my proxy. 


10.</s><s> but, now beacuse you do not have internet access, you'll get this error.</s><s> click connect later.</s><s> 
</s><s>11. select your customizations (if any) and click install. 
12. when installation is complete, click launch now. 
13. you'll get an error since you don't have internet, click "having trouble connecting to the internet?" 
14. click offline activation. 
15. click generate request code. 
16. go to http://www.adobe.com/go/getactivated, sign in, put in your request code and serial number and generate the response code.* 17. enter the response code.</s><s> 18. click activate.</s><s> 
</s><s>19. click launch when you get the offline activation complete dialog. 

* if you are installing more than one product, generate the response codes for each at the same time.</s><s> i ran into an issue where once i created a response code, no other response codes i created for subsequent installs were accepted.</s><s> i had to wait 24 hours for a newly generated code to work. 
</s><s>you are done!</s><s> enjoy your software! 
</s><s>cheers! -greg

<s>just want to point out--after many hours of attempting to activate cs6 software (stumping two adobe techs in the process)--that there is one important bit of information left out of the directions given above (and it's not in the video either): 
these instructions work only if you are starting the installation from scratch.</s><s> if you (mistakenly) think that your inability to connect to adobe's activation server is temporary and go ahead and install the software, you will not be able to get back to the screen to generate a request code (which you need to be able to activate the application).</s><s> this is in spite of adobe's assurance to the contrary that if you don't activate during installation, you can do it later when the application starts.</s><s> if you try to activate later, you are taken to an online screen that asks for the "request code"--but you have not been given an opportunity to get that request code. 
</s><s>the only solution i could find: i had to uninstall photoshop cs6, then unplug my internet connection, then reinstall the software, watching carefully for the screen that provides the button to generate a request code.</s><s> if adobe is going to require the activation/validation procedure, then it really needs to make it work and correct the error in the software, namely, the failure to provide for offline activation once the software has been installed.

<post author="Jeff A Wright" timestamp="Jun 10, 2013 8:59 AM">
<s>effective december 13, adobe disabled the activation server for cs2 products and acrobat 7 because of a technical glitch.</s><s> these products were released over 7 years ago and do not run on many modern operating systems.</s><s> but to ensure that any customers activating those old versions can continue to use their software, we issued a serial number directly to those customers.</s><s> while this might be interpreted as adobe giving away software for free, we did it to help our customers. 
</s><s>if your software is affected by the activation server shut down then you will receive an error that the activation server is unavailable.</s><s> the specific affected products are as follows:

</s><s>the activation server being shut down will not affect currently installed and activated adobe software.</s><s> you will only face this difficulty if you need to reactivate the software.

<post author="Jeff A Wright" timestamp="Jun 10, 2013 8:59 AM">
<s>effective december 13, adobe disabled the activation server for cs2 products and acrobat 7 because of a technical glitch.</s><s> these products were released over 7 years ago and do not run on many modern operating systems.</s><s> but to ensure that any customers activating those old versions can continue to use their software, we issued a serial number directly to those customers.</s><s> while this might be interpreted as adobe giving away software for free, we did it to help our customers. 
</s><s>if your software is affected by the activation server shut down then you will receive an error that the activation server is unavailable.</s><s> the specific affected products are as follows: 
acrobat 7.0 - windows after effects 7.0 audition 3.0 captivate 1.0 contribute 2.0 contribute 3.0 creative suite 2.0 director mx 2004 dreamweaver mx 2004 fireworks mx 2004 flash paper 2.0 freehand mx golive cs2 golive 9.0 illustrator cs2 incopy cs2 indesign cs2 macromedia studo mx 2004 photoshop cs photoshop cs2 photoshop elements 4.0 photoshop elements 5.0 premiere pro 7.0 production studio premium 

</s><s>the activation server being shut down will not affect currently installed and activated adobe software.</s><s> you will only face this difficulty if you need to reactivate the software. 
</s><s>to remedy this difficulty we have made available a version of these software titles that does not require activation for users who have previously purchase the affected software.</s><s> for additional details and specific links to the software please see: 
error: activation server unavailable | cs2 products, acrobat 7 - http://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/policy-pricing/creative-suite-2-activation-end-life.html 
error: activation server unavailable | macromedia branded products - http://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/policy-pricing/macromedia-legacy-ac tivation-error.html 
if the software title you have purchased is affected by the activation server being shut down, but is not available for download in the previously referenced pages, then please contact our support team at http://www.adobe.com/support/chat/ivrchat.html.</s><s> please be aware our support team will not be able to provide assistance for downloading or installing the creative suite 2 software. 

</s><s>system requirements 

</s><s>creative suite 2 software was only designed to run in the following operating environments: 
mac os x v.10.2.8–v.10.3.8.</s><s> powerpc® g4 or g5 processor microsoft® windows® 2000/windows xp.</s><s> intel® pentium® iii or 4 processor 

</s><s>extraction instructions 

</s><s>if you are receiving a message to insert disc two please see the following extraction instructions: 
in the english version of the software the file creativesuitecs2disc2 extracts to c:\creative suite\adobe creative suite 2.0\.</s><s> creativesuitecs2disc1 and creativesuitecs2disc3 both extract to c:\creative suite cs2\adobe creative suite 2.0\. 
</s><s>please copy the contents of the c:\creative suite\adobe creative suite 2.0\ folder to the c:\creative suite cs2\adobe creative suite 2.0\ folder and you will no longer be prompted to insert disc two. 

</s><s>additional information 
some users have reported success getting creative suite 2 to install under windows 7 64-bit.</s><s> please see http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_pro grams/windows-7-is-not-compatible-with-adobe-photoshop/6f1b4955-7166-4 b8f-ad9b-5d19150f803f for more information. 

</s><s>still facing installation difficulties? 
</s><s>if you are experiencing an installation issue with the software currently available i would recommend creating a new thread in the downloading, installing, and setting up forum - http://forums.adobe.com/community/download_install_setup.</s><s> if you can please make sure to include the following: 
- what software are you trying to install? - which operating system are you using? - was the software previously installed prior to downloading the non-activating version currently available? - what specific error messages are you receiving when trying to install? 

</s><s>please also see the original discussion on this topic at http://forums.adobe.com/message/4919014#4919014.
