<s>hello, 
</s><s>i'll try my best to answer your questions. 
1.</s><s> drmmanager.issupported does not imply whether or not adobe access drm is supported on the given platform.</s><s> the api describes whether or not the drmmanager class is available on that platform.</s><s> most of the time though, when the drmmanager class is available, drm should be available on that platform - however, not all situations (notably - simulators) do not allow drm playback if the api is available, since that presents a possible attack vector, if we were to allow drm video to flow through a debuggable environment. 
2.</s><s> getting into the apple ecosystem is not an easy task, due to a number of restrictions.</s><s> it was not an adobe decision to not support hds on ios devices.</s><s> the apple terms of service state that all video streamed to their ios devices must be hls.</s><s> to support hds would be a non-starter if you want to get your app approved by the app store. 
3.</s><s> adobe's premium video initiative on mobile platforms is not the same as adobe's air initiative on mobile.</s><s> video is spearheaded by the adobe primetime umbrella, which answers the problem of streaming protected video to ios (in native ios obj-c apps), to android (in native android java apps), and to the desktop (using flash player, which can now consume hls content).</s><s> adobe has decided to take this route (in-app vs in-browser) as it's what most of the premium-video market has demanded. 
</s><s>adobe air is a great write-once environment, but there are currently limitations if you want to delivery premium video to ios devices.

<s>your comments on point 3 are sobering and kind of a slap in the face to someone who has been developing a streaming app with the idea that adobe air has 99% reach in the desktop and mobile market.</s><s> i went back to the http dynamic streaming and adobe access pages to find the restrictions that i missed when i was deciding on the technologies to use. 
</s><s>the only hint of not being able to use hds or osmf on ios was the omission that adobe access protection could be delivered via adobe air on ios devices as shown in the first image below of the adobe access technical specs. 

</s><s>on the other hand, there all kinds of statements and illustrations that would make you believe otherwise, especially on mobile devices. 



no explicit statement can be found that says that hls is the only way to stream content to ios devices, that the osmf framework is hls agnostic, and that one has to build an ios native app from scratch if they want to consume protected hls.</s><s> i guess not smth you want to put on a page where you want to market a product. 
</s><s>in building a native app, how do i make up for the lost functionality that comes by default with air such as the integration of adobe access in air, drm management, swf verification, etc. 
</s><s>as it stands, the osmf framework is a half-baked solution as it cannot be used on ios devices because it is hls agnostic-.although some folks have written plugins to enable osmf to consume hls. 
i am currently testing a plugin to see if i can consume protected hls.</s><s> if i fail then i will scrap the entire project-which also means not buying adobe access or adobe media servers.</s><s> neither will i be looking at adobe primetime. 
</s><s>my osmf based app is able to consume hls content when i debug in air simulator.</s><s> testing on ios simulator or ios devices has yet to prove successful.</s><s> something breaks inside air when it is compiled using ios sdk. 
</s><s>the reason why i chose adobe technologies is because it seemed like all the pieces were there to put together a streaming solution that fit my business model.</s><s> i did not want to have to write everything and adobe technologies promised a quick time to market.</s><s> now 7 months later i am finding out that perhaps i should have read the adobe access technical specs with the precision of a lawyer. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------- 
in my testing, protected content cannot be consumed in air unless drmmanager class is available.</s><s> in help.adobe.com we read the following: 
</s><s>"the drmmanager manages the retrieval and storage of the vouchers needed to view drm-protected content.</s><s> with the static drmmanager.getdrmmanager() method, you can access the existing drmmanager object to perform the following drm-management tasks: preload vouchers from a media rights server, using a drmcontentdata object.</s><s> query the local cache for an individual voucher, using a drmcontentdata object.</s><s> reset all vouchers (air only) air profile support: this feature is supported on all desktop operating systems and air for tv devices, but it is not supported on mobile devices.</s><s> you can test for support at run time using the drmmanager.issupported property." 
</s><s>using osmf 2.0 framework, i have been able to take advantage of both phds and adobe access protection schemes in my flex based app running on adobe air on android.</s><s> in android devices, drmmanager .issupported returns true. 
</s><s>in ios, it seems to be a whole different story.</s><s> as i said in my first post, drmmanager.issupported returns false when testing via ios simulator but returns true when testing via air simulator.</s><s> so the attack vector idea that you put forward cannot stand because if that was true it would require drmmanager.issupported to be false in all debugging scenarios not just on ios simulator or ios devices. 
</s><s>the behavior of the app in ios simulator and air simulator is not consistent when it comes to responding to touch based events and rendering visual elements as well.</s><s> performance and functionality degrades even more when testing directly on ios devices.</s><s> all ios devices exhibit the same symptoms.</s><s> for example, trying to select a list item is almost impossible-.item renderers simply do not respond when one tries to select an item. 
no such symptoms or differences exist between air simulator and android devices.</s><s> so, it seems to me that there are air to ios compilation issues when a mobile air app is packaged through ios sdk.</s><s> smth brakes inside of air during packaging.</s><s> i believe that this is the reason why drmmanager.issupported returns false when testing app in ios simulator and devices.

<s>hello, 
</s><s>i'm sorry for the confusion you've encountered with our documentation - we will have to revisit our marketing material and documentation to update them so that others do not spend time trying to go down that path. 
</s><s>adobe does not provide support for hds on air on ios because apple's recommended protocol for delivering video to ios is hls.</s><s> because of this, adobe has chosen to go with hls delivery to ios - it's better to find out now that hds isn't viable on ios, rather than to complete your ios app, submit it to the app store, and then find out apple rejects the app because it does not use hls.

<s>hello, 
</s><s>a few clarifications that i hope will clear things up for you. 
1. phds/phls uses adobe access drm; it's just another mode to use our drm, and is geared towards the streaming use cases (for more setup details: http://www.adobe.com/devnet/adobe-media-server/articles/content-protec tion-using-phds-phls.html).</s><s> since adobe access drm isn't available on air ios, this use case isn't currently possible. 
2.</s><s> since adobe doesn't provide a full drm solution for air on ios, an option may be to use rtmpe.</s><s> rtmpe predates adobe access drm, which is beyond my area of expertise, but it may work for you.</s><s> however, the extremly large caveat here is that apple's terms strongly recommend using hls to stream to appstore apps.</s><s> if you use a non-hls delivery mechanism, i'm not sure if apple will approve your app. 
3.</s><s> another option if you want to stream hls content to ios is to use standard hls aes encryption (vanilla aes encryption).</s><s> the modes of hls streaming we provide with adobe media server (starting with version 5.0.3) are: (1) unprotected, (2) vanilla aes, (3) phls, (4) full adobe access drm.</s><s> items 3 & 4 leverage adobe access drm technology, which means they're non-starters with air on ios.</s><s> the caveat if you use item#2 is that i'm not sure if osmf supports vanilla aes encrypted hls. 
</s><s>please bear in mind that solution #2 will require an hls keyserver (as per the hls spec).

<s>(hit send too quickly, since i didn't answer your other questions): 
a. you are incorrect that swf verification is only available when using air and not the native app.</s><s> you're probably thinking of swf verfiication (a fms/ams feature) - you can engage swf verification from the ams/fms via: http://help.adobe.com/en_us/adobemediaserver/configadmin/ws5b3ccc516d4 fbf351e63e3d119f2925e64-7fe0.2.3.html. 
</s><s>agnostic to the final form of your application (be it air or native or swf), you can set a drm policy setting (we call it airapplicationid) to white-list your application.</s><s> the drm policy setting is computed using the signing certificate you used to sign your final air application (or a hash of your swf, if you're using flash).</s><s> at runtime, a hash is computed across your application to determine if the app has the same signature as what was specified in your drm policy. 
b.</s><s> i don't quite follow what you're asking here: "i also wonder to call adobe access ios player from within my air app.</s><s> if yes, it might be possible for me to retain most of the app logic and just push a url to the adobe access ios player to play the content." i'm a bit confused here.</s><s> are you wondering about taking the adobe primetime ios player and feeding the url into it from your osmf/air app?</s><s> that's certainly possible, but a bit heavy-handed & more complex than simply using the adobe primetime ios player sdk directly.

</s><s>"swf verification protects your content by preventing unauthorized clients from accessing it.</s><s> to enable swf verification for http streaming, you need to enable protected http streaming (phds).</s><s> phds is used to serve protected content to flash player and air-based clients, over http, without using a drm license server.</s><s> with phds, when adobe media server encrypts and packages the content, it generates a license using the shared domain certificates and embeds it into the drm metadata of the content stream that is delivered with the media.</s><s> the flash player and air clients then retrieve the license from the content stream and use it for decryption, eliminating the need to communicate with a license server.</s><s> to enable swf verification you create a list of "authorized" swf files, called a whitelist.</s><s> these files are specified in the embedded license and sent to the client inside the drm metadata.</s><s> on the client, swf verification is enforced by adobe access runtime inside the flash player and air.</s><s> during drm authentication, flash player or air attempt to verify the swf hash in the drm metadata with the swf that is trying to access the resource.</s><s> if the verification fails, flash player or air throws a runtime error (3310) and the client stops requesting the content." player binding for http live streaming adobe media server supports whitelist-based player binding for http live streaming (hls).</s><s> this feature is similar to the phds/prtmp swf verification feature.</s><s> using adobe media server you can deliver protected streams to ios based clients over http using protected http live streaming (phls).</s><s> phls is a non-drm based protection scheme similar to phds.</s><s> when player binding is enabled with phls, ams will add the list of identifiers picked up from the .airwhitelist files and embed it into the drm metadata.</s><s> swf verification is then enforced by the adobe access sdk on the ios client.</s><s> you can find more information regarding player binding here." as the above paragraphs show, you are correct in saying that swf verification is available for ios devices as well through the use of adobe access sdk on the ios client.</s><s> my understanding is that adobe primetime ios player sdk has replaced adobe access sdk for ios after ios 7 was released.</s><s> yesterday, i submitted a request with adobe primetime, but so far no one has contacted me.</s><s> maybe you can expedite the process on your side.</s><s> let me also say, that i agree with your comments on point b. your understanding of my poorly worded question is mostly correct.</s><s> in my air app for ios, i have removed the osmf framework because it is of no use.</s><s> i am using the stagevideo and netstream classes directly.</s><s> i agree that the approach i suggested would be heavy-handed but, i am behind schedule and this approach would enable me to get my app out there while working on developing an ios app.</s><s> in essence, this would enable me to salvage the project.</s><s> i hope this make sense. 
</s><s>if you can do anything to expedite my request with adobe primetime folks then please do because at this point time is of the essence.</s><s> maybe you can help me get my hands on the primetime ios player sdk faster.</s><s> thanks again for your help.

<s>hello, 
</s><s>i'll try my best to answer your questions. 
1.</s><s> drmmanager.issupported does not imply whether or not adobe access drm is supported on the given platform.</s><s> the api describes whether or not the drmmanager class is available on that platform.</s><s> most of the time though, when the drmmanager class is available, drm should be available on that platform - however, not all situations (notably - simulators) do not allow drm playback if the api is available, since that presents a possible attack vector, if we were to allow drm video to flow through a debuggable environment. 
2.</s><s> getting into the apple ecosystem is not an easy task, due to a number of restrictions.</s><s> it was not an adobe decision to not support hds on ios devices.</s><s> the apple terms of service state that all video streamed to their ios devices must be hls.</s><s> to support hds would be a non-starter if you want to get your app approved by the app store. 
3.</s><s> adobe's premium video initiative on mobile platforms is not the same as adobe's air initiative on mobile.</s><s> video is spearheaded by the adobe primetime umbrella, which answers the problem of streaming protected video to ios (in native ios obj-c apps), to android (in native android java apps), and to the desktop (using flash player, which can now consume hls content).</s><s> adobe has decided to take this route (in-app vs in-browser) as it's what most of the premium-video market has demanded. 
</s><s>adobe air is a great write-once environment, but there are currently limitations if you want to delivery premium video to ios devices.

<s>your comments on point 3 are sobering and kind of a slap in the face to someone who has been developing a streaming app with the idea that adobe air has 99% reach in the desktop and mobile market.</s><s> i went back to the http dynamic streaming and adobe access pages to find the restrictions that i missed when i was deciding on the technologies to use. 
</s><s>the only hint of not being able to use hds or osmf on ios was the omission that adobe access protection could be delivered via adobe air on ios devices as shown in the first image below of the adobe access technical specs. 

</s><s>on the other hand, there all kinds of statements and illustrations that would make you believe otherwise, especially on mobile devices. 



no explicit statement can be found that says that hls is the only way to stream content to ios devices, that the osmf framework is hls agnostic, and that one has to build an ios native app from scratch if they want to consume protected hls.</s><s> i guess not smth you want to put on a page where you want to market a product. 
</s><s>in building a native app, how do i make up for the lost functionality that comes by default with air such as the integration of adobe access in air, drm management, swf verification, etc. 
</s><s>as it stands, the osmf framework is a half-baked solution as it cannot be used on ios devices because it is hls agnostic-.although some folks have written plugins to enable osmf to consume hls. 
i am currently testing a plugin to see if i can consume protected hls.</s><s> if i fail then i will scrap the entire project-which also means not buying adobe access or adobe media servers.</s><s> neither will i be looking at adobe primetime. 
</s><s>my osmf based app is able to consume hls content when i debug in air simulator.</s><s> testing on ios simulator or ios devices has yet to prove successful.</s><s> something breaks inside air when it is compiled using ios sdk. 
</s><s>the reason why i chose adobe technologies is because it seemed like all the pieces were there to put together a streaming solution that fit my business model.</s><s> i did not want to have to write everything and adobe technologies promised a quick time to market.</s><s> now 7 months later i am finding out that perhaps i should have read the adobe access technical specs with the precision of a lawyer. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------- 
in my testing, protected content cannot be consumed in air unless drmmanager class is available.</s><s> in help.adobe.com we read the following: 
</s><s>"the drmmanager manages the retrieval and storage of the vouchers needed to view drm-protected content.</s><s> with the static drmmanager.getdrmmanager() method, you can access the existing drmmanager object to perform the following drm-management tasks: preload vouchers from a media rights server, using a drmcontentdata object.</s><s> query the local cache for an individual voucher, using a drmcontentdata object.</s><s> reset all vouchers (air only) air profile support: this feature is supported on all desktop operating systems and air for tv devices, but it is not supported on mobile devices.</s><s> you can test for support at run time using the drmmanager.issupported property." 
</s><s>using osmf 2.0 framework, i have been able to take advantage of both phds and adobe access protection schemes in my flex based app running on adobe air on android.</s><s> in android devices, drmmanager .issupported returns true. 
</s><s>in ios, it seems to be a whole different story.</s><s> as i said in my first post, drmmanager.issupported returns false when testing via ios simulator but returns true when testing via air simulator.</s><s> so the attack vector idea that you put forward cannot stand because if that was true it would require drmmanager.issupported to be false in all debugging scenarios not just on ios simulator or ios devices. 
</s><s>the behavior of the app in ios simulator and air simulator is not consistent when it comes to responding to touch based events and rendering visual elements as well.</s><s> performance and functionality degrades even more when testing directly on ios devices.</s><s> all ios devices exhibit the same symptoms.</s><s> for example, trying to select a list item is almost impossible-.item renderers simply do not respond when one tries to select an item. 
no such symptoms or differences exist between air simulator and android devices.</s><s> so, it seems to me that there are air to ios compilation issues when a mobile air app is packaged through ios sdk.</s><s> smth brakes inside of air during packaging.</s><s> i believe that this is the reason why drmmanager.issupported returns false when testing app in ios simulator and devices.

2.</s><s> since adobe doesn't provide a full drm solution for air on ios, an option may be to use rtmpe.</s><s> rtmpe predates adobe access drm, which is beyond my area of expertise, but it may work for you.</s><s> however, the extremly large caveat here is that apple's terms strongly recommend using hls to stream to appstore apps.</s><s> if you use a non-hls delivery mechanism, i'm not sure if apple will approve your app. 
3.</s><s> another option if you want to stream hls content to ios is to use standard hls aes encryption (vanilla aes encryption).</s><s> the modes of hls streaming we provide with adobe media server (starting with version 5.0.3) are: (1) unprotected, (2) vanilla aes, (3) phls, (4) full adobe access drm.</s><s> items 3 & 4 leverage adobe access drm technology, which means they're non-starters with air on ios.</s><s> the caveat if you use item#2 is that i'm not sure if osmf supports vanilla aes encrypted hls. 
</s><s>please bear in mind that solution #2 will require an hls keyserver (as per the hls spec).

<s>(hit send too quickly, since i didn't answer your other questions): 
a. you are incorrect that swf verification is only available when using air and not the native app.</s><s> you're probably thinking of swf verfiication (a fms/ams feature) - you can engage swf verification from the ams/fms via: http://help.adobe.com/en_us/adobemediaserver/configadmin/ws5b3ccc516d4 fbf351e63e3d119f2925e64-7fe0.2.3.html. 
</s><s>agnostic to the final form of your application (be it air or native or swf), you can set a drm policy setting (we call it airapplicationid) to white-list your application.</s><s> the drm policy setting is computed using the signing certificate you used to sign your final air application (or a hash of your swf, if you're using flash).</s><s> at runtime, a hash is computed across your application to determine if the app has the same signature as what was specified in your drm policy. 
b.</s><s> i don't quite follow what you're asking here: "i also wonder to call adobe access ios player from within my air app.</s><s> if yes, it might be possible for me to retain most of the app logic and just push a url to the adobe access ios player to play the content." i'm a bit confused here.</s><s> are you wondering about taking the adobe primetime ios player and feeding the url into it from your osmf/air app?</s><s> that's certainly possible, but a bit heavy-handed & more complex than simply using the adobe primetime ios player sdk directly.

<s>eric, 
</s><s>i am grateful for your continued interest in this discussion.</s><s> without exaggeration, it might prove to be the only reason why i may continue my relationship with adobe. 
</s><s>after reading your comments, i revisited the article that can be found at the following link. http://www.adobe.com/devnet/adobe-media-server/articles/swf-verificati on-protected-http-dynamic-streaming.html.</s><s> let me quote a couple of paragraphs for the sake of our discussion. 
</s><s>"swf verification protects your content by preventing unauthorized clients from accessing it.</s><s> to enable swf verification for http streaming, you need to enable protected http streaming (phds).</s><s> phds is used to serve protected content to flash player and air-based clients, over http, without using a drm license server.</s><s> with phds, when adobe media server encrypts and packages the content, it generates a license using the shared domain certificates and embeds it into the drm metadata of the content stream that is delivered with the media.</s><s> the flash player and air clients then retrieve the license from the content stream and use it for decryption, eliminating the need to communicate with a license server.</s><s> to enable swf verification you create a list of "authorized" swf files, called a whitelist.</s><s> these files are specified in the embedded license and sent to the client inside the drm metadata.</s><s> on the client, swf verification is enforced by adobe access runtime inside the flash player and air.</s><s> during drm authentication, flash player or air attempt to verify the swf hash in the drm metadata with the swf that is trying to access the resource.</s><s> if the verification fails, flash player or air throws a runtime error (3310) and the client stops requesting the content." player binding for http live streaming adobe media server supports whitelist-based player binding for http live streaming (hls).</s><s> this feature is similar to the phds/prtmp swf verification feature.</s><s> using adobe media server you can deliver protected streams to ios based clients over http using protected http live streaming (phls).</s><s> phls is a non-drm based protection scheme similar to phds.</s><s> when player binding is enabled with phls, ams will add the list of identifiers picked up from the .airwhitelist files and embed it into the drm metadata.</s><s> swf verification is then enforced by the adobe access sdk on the ios client.</s><s> you can find more information regarding player binding here." as the above paragraphs show, you are correct in saying that swf verification is available for ios devices as well through the use of adobe access sdk on the ios client.</s><s> my understanding is that adobe primetime ios player sdk has replaced adobe access sdk for ios after ios 7 was released.</s><s> yesterday, i submitted a request with adobe primetime, but so far no one has contacted me.</s><s> maybe you can expedite the process on your side.</s><s> let me also say, that i agree with your comments on point b. your understanding of my poorly worded question is mostly correct.</s><s> in my air app for ios, i have removed the osmf framework because it is of no use.</s><s> i am using the stagevideo and netstream classes directly.</s><s> i agree that the approach i suggested would be heavy-handed but, i am behind schedule and this approach would enable me to get my app out there while working on developing an ios app.</s><s> in essence, this would enable me to salvage the project.</s><s> i hope this make sense. 
</s><s>if you can do anything to expedite my request with adobe primetime folks then please do because at this point time is of the essence.</s><s> maybe you can help me get my hands on the primetime ios player sdk faster.</s><s> thanks again for your help.

<s>hi, 
</s><s>after reading your document quotes, i called someone from the fms team (i'm a drm expert, not so much with fms).</s><s> he pointed me to this link, which essentially says that "swf-v" is the same as adobe access's "swf whitelisting / air app id whitelisting": http://help.adobe.com/en_us/adobemediaserver/devguide/ws52621785137562 06-4b6aabd1378392bb59-7fff.html#ws5262178513756206-4b6aabd1378392bb59- 7fed 
i was wrong telling you they were 2 different features.</s><s> sorry.</s><s> 
</s><s>since the underlying technology of swf-v/whitelisting uses adobe access drm technology, your content will have to be protected with either adobe access drm or phls/phds to leverage it.</s><s> which brings us back to square 1 - adobe access drm technology (which phds/phls also uses) is not available in air for ios, so you cannot strongly-bind (whitelist) your content to only play on your ios application.</s><s> the only real story for using adobe software to send drm content to ios devices is still via primetime. 
</s><s>i've reached out to our primetime program manager to see if we have a trial program for pt that we can add you to.

<s>hi eric   i work with ben at ioko.  following on from this, we ran through the quickstart guide.  as you're aware, this requires a different packager - previously we were using the command line packager, but the one specified in the quickstart guide has a ui.   using this packager, we were able to play encrypted content.  when we played the content in our player, firebug showed the following http requests:   - get sintel_1500_packaged.f4v : 200 ok - get crossdomain.xml : 200 ok - post v1 : 200 ok   the post request is the one sent to the license server.  since this returned successfully and the content played, i think we have proved that our license server is working correctly.   apart from the packager, the only other difference is a minor modification made to our player.  as we're no longer using an .f4m file it no longer makes sense to use the f4melement class:   var urlresource:urlresource = new urlresource(default_video_url); mediaplayersprite.resource = urlresource; // var f4melement:f4melement = new f4melement(urlresource); // mediaplayersprite.mediaplayer.media = f4melement;   we would still like to use the command line packager, but (as stated above) the player does not attempt to obtain a license when we try to play assets that are packaged + encrypted with it.  it looks increasingly likely that this is due to a fault in the packager itself.   thanks for your help   sam

<s>hi sam,

<s>
</s><s>eric 
</s><s>thanks for getting back to us. from reading the other thread, it seems like the suggested solution is as follows: 
</s><s>"please update the certs as needed and try again. 
</s><s>the correct extended key usage (eku) of the certs should be: packager cert = xxx.54 transport cert = xxx.55 license server cert = xxx.56 
if you happen to have a super-cert (one with all 3 ekus), then that can be used in place of all certs.</s><s> however, after looking at your f4fpackager package, this does not seem to be the case." 
</s><s>this is puzzling because (a) we only have one cert and (b) as far as we can tell, it does have all 3 eku's.</s><s> the reason i say this is because i've just run the following command: 
openssl x509 -in ioko-license.pem -text 
and got back this: 
certificate: data: ... 
</s><s>x509v3 extended key usage: 1.2.840.113583.3.9.1.54, 1.2.840.113583.3.9.1.55, 1.2.840.113583.3.9.1.56 
</s><s>to me it looks like our pem/cert does contain all 3 eku's.</s><s> and it's that pem file we refer to in the packager config: 
<offline> <input-file>big_train_28_v2.mp4</input-file> <output-path>encrypted</output-path> <transport-cert>ioko-license.pem</transport-cert> <license-server-url>http://kgd-red-lic01.dev.vodco.co.uk:8080</license-server-url> <license-server-cert>ioko-license.pem</license-server-cert> <packager-credential>ioko-license.pfx</packager-credential> <credential-pwd>our main office is in york</credential-pwd> <common-key>key.bin</common-key> <content-id>sam</content-id> <policy-file>policy.pol</policy-file> </offline> 
</s><s>so am i right in saying that we should be able to use that pem in all contexts?

<s>further to my last post, i should also point out that the policy we're using to package the content is very simple and does not contain any custom properties.</s><s> the code we used to create it looks like this: 
policy demopolicy = new policy(false); // no root license id 
licenseserverinfo linfo = new licenseserverinfo(authenticationtype.anonymous); demopolicy.setlicenseserverinfo(linfo); demopolicy.setname("demopolicy"); 
// rights playright pr = new playright(); list<right> rightslist = new arraylist<right>(); rightslist.add(pr); demopolicy.setrights(rightslist);

<s>hi eric   i work with ben at ioko.  following on from this, we ran through the quickstart guide.  as you're aware, this requires a different packager - previously we were using the command line packager, but the one specified in the quickstart guide has a ui.   using this packager, we were able to play encrypted content.  when we played the content in our player, firebug showed the following http requests:   - get sintel_1500_packaged.f4v : 200 ok - get crossdomain.xml : 200 ok - post v1 : 200 ok   the post request is the one sent to the license server.  since this returned successfully and the content played, i think we have proved that our license server is working correctly.   apart from the packager, the only other difference is a minor modification made to our player.  as we're no longer using an .f4m file it no longer makes sense to use the f4melement class:   var urlresource:urlresource = new urlresource(default_video_url); mediaplayersprite.resource = urlresource; // var f4melement:f4melement = new f4melement(urlresource); // mediaplayersprite.mediaplayer.media = f4melement;   we would still like to use the command line packager, but (as stated above) the player does not attempt to obtain a license when we try to play assets that are packaged + encrypted with it.  it looks increasingly likely that this is due to a fault in the packager itself.   thanks for your help   sam

<s>hi sam, 
</s><s>both the command line packager and the ui packager do the same thing (and implement the same apis), so you can use whichever is more convenient for your purposes.

<s>
</s><s>eric 
</s><s>thanks for getting back to us. from reading the other thread, it seems like the suggested solution is as follows: 
</s><s>"please update the certs as needed and try again. 
</s><s>the correct extended key usage (eku) of the certs should be: packager cert = xxx.54 transport cert = xxx.55 license server cert = xxx.56 
if you happen to have a super-cert (one with all 3 ekus), then that can be used in place of all certs.</s><s> however, after looking at your f4fpackager package, this does not seem to be the case." 
</s><s>this is puzzling because (a) we only have one cert and (b) as far as we can tell, it does have all 3 eku's.</s><s> the reason i say this is because i've just run the following command: 
openssl x509 -in ioko-license.pem -text 
and got back this: 
certificate: data: ... 
</s><s>x509v3 extended key usage: 1.2.840.113583.3.9.1.54, 1.2.840.113583.3.9.1.55, 1.2.840.113583.3.9.1.56 
</s><s>to me it looks like our pem/cert does contain all 3 eku's.</s><s> and it's that pem file we refer to in the packager config: 
<offline> <input-file>big_train_28_v2.mp4</input-file> <output-path>encrypted</output-path> <transport-cert>ioko-license.pem</transport-cert> <license-server-url>http://kgd-red-lic01.dev.vodco.co.uk:8080</license-server-url> <license-server-cert>ioko-license.pem</license-server-cert> <packager-credential>ioko-license.pfx</packager-credential> <credential-pwd>our main office is in york</credential-pwd> <common-key>key.bin</common-key> <content-id>sam</content-id> <policy-file>policy.pol</policy-file> </offline>

<s>further to my last post, i should also point out that the policy we're using to package the content is very simple and does not contain any custom properties.</s><s> the code we used to create it looks like this: 
policy demopolicy = new policy(false); // no root license id 
licenseserverinfo linfo = new licenseserverinfo(authenticationtype.anonymous); demopolicy.setlicenseserverinfo(linfo); demopolicy.setname("demopolicy");

<post author="Eric Ha" timestamp="Mar 12, 2014 2:59 PM">
<s>[ background ] adobe primetime allows drm-protected hls (and soon, dash) streaming to all platforms that video broadcasters want to hit - desktop computers, mobile devices (ios & android), set top boxes, smart tv's, etc... 
</s><s>how does license acquisition & playback happen in the ios environment when using adobe access drm in conjunction with adobe primetime media player sdk (psdk)? 

[ answer ] adobe access traditionally provides a java sdk that can be used to build a license server.</s><s> this license server can issue adobe access drm licenses to all platforms that can consume adobe access protected content. 
</s><s>in addition to the license server, the ios platform (and only the ios platform) supports an additional server called the hls key server.</s><s> this is an http server that provides aes keys to the client when it is attempting to decrypt a .ts segment referenced in an .m3u8 playlist.</s><s> this (remote) key server is only supported for the ios use case, because it is the traditional model for protecting hls content streamed to ios devices.</s><s> when adobe implemented support for hls playback on non-ios platforms, adobe removed the requirement of a (remote) key server.</s><s> the .m3u8 manifest still contains references for key server uri's, but those uri's point to local-host, where there is a local http server running that can feed the necessary aes keys to the video player.

</s><s>after packaging hls content to use adobe access drm, the resultant m3u8 file is not directly consumable - it is an invalid m3u8.</s><s> it must first be processed by the primetime player sdk (psdk) the ios app (built using the psdk) detects that the hls content is protected with adobe access drm and: requests a license from an adobe access license server (using the drmmanager api) updates/rewrites the m3u8 into a form that can be ingested by apple's avplayer subsystem (if the drm policy has policy.requirekeyserver=true), all of the keyserver uri's in the m3u8 are updated to add a url query parameter which includes an encrypted keytoken containing the content aes key.</s><s> only the adobe key server can decrypt this keytoken and return the content aes key.</s><s> (if the drm policy has policy.requirekeyserver=false), all of the keyserver uri's in the m3u8 point to localhost.</s><s> the psdk runs its own lightweight http server that will return the content aes key.</s><s> the ios app then initiates a "play" operation by passing the .m3u8 file to the apple avplayer as per the hls spec, when avplayer plays the .m3u8 as normal on encountering a key server url in the m3u8, key server will reach out to the server endpoint to get the aes key needed to decrypt the following segments if .requirekeyserver=true, the key will be requested from the designated adobe access keyserver over ssl if .requirekeyserver=false, the ios app will request the key from a local key server that is embedded into the primetime psdk (instead of reaching out over the internet)

<s>hi hiroshi, 
</s><s><quote>
<s>are you saying you are using non-default compiler in flash builder? 
</s></quote>
i am saying that i keep my flash builder updated with the latest build of air and the latest compiler because a) there are always bugs and b) there are massive performance gains in so doing.</s><s> case in point being the several-fold decrease in compilation time that only became available with air 4 and the -uselegacyaot argument, released very recently indeed. http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/air-sdk-download.html http://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/multi/how-overlay-air-sdk-flex-sdk. html 
<quote>
<s>is it apach flex 4.11.0?</s><s> 
</s></quote>
no. it is flash builder 4.7 downloaded from adobe creative cloud. 
<quote>
<s>can you try to build your app with flex 4.6.0? 
</s></quote>
</s><s>the issue is not the flex sdk - i am using flex 4.6.0 for my flex projects, but i am using air 4.0.0.1628 for my air projects because it is massively better, offers massively faster compilation times and fixes any number of irritating bugs of earlier air sdks...</s><s> oh, and, it contains various features that are essential to be able to actually release any piece of software i make as it will meet the requirements of apple etc where the (outdated) version of air that ships with fb does not. 
</s><s>neither moving back to an earlier release of air nor moving back to flash builder 4.6 are possible as both would mean a drastic loss of function and dividing up my code-base so as to be unable to share significant libraries of code between projects. 
<quote>
<s>and, do you really need to compress your swf with lzma compression? 
</s></quote>
</s><s>unless you can show me a compiler argument in flash builder that will get it to do anything else, then yes i do.</s><s> that is the default behaviour for -compress=true in flash builder with the most current air and compiler.</s><s> using -compress=false is not an option as it knocks my swf from 250kb (which is acceptable) up to 750kb (which is not acceptable).</s><s> we looked at the license cost of third-party zipping tools and they were coming in at approximately $300 in order to generate a file of 325kb - in other words, we would be taking on a costly license to do something that we can already do, only not as well...</s><s> the other option is to home-cook an air desktop app to do the zipping / compression after the fact. 
i have not opted to do any specific form of file compression, this is what the default is for the compiler that was released by adobe.</s><s> i have not set any special compilation parameters.</s><s> i have not done anything other than keep my development tools up to date with the latest release from adobe. 
</s><s>it seems to me that this is an adobe issue and it is one that should be exceptionally easy for adobe to fix, where it is neither easy nor cheap for your customers to fix. 
i very much doubt that i am the only flex / flash developer who keeps his tools up to date and i anticipate that there will be more calls for you to resolve this if you do not resolve it now.

<s>hi hiroshi, 
</s><s><quote>
<s>are you saying you are using non-default compiler in flash builder? 
</s></quote>
i am saying that i keep my flash builder updated with the latest build of air and the latest compiler because a) there are always bugs and b) there are massive performance gains in so doing.</s><s> case in point being the several-fold decrease in compilation time that only became available with air 4 and the -uselegacyaot argument, released very recently indeed. http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/air-sdk-download.html http://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/multi/how-overlay-air-sdk-flex-sdk. html 
<quote>
<s>is it apach flex 4.11.0?</s><s> 
</s></quote>
no. it is flash builder 4.7 downloaded from adobe creative cloud. 
<quote>
<s>can you try to build your app with flex 4.6.0? 
</s></quote>
</s><s>the issue is not the flex sdk - i am using flex 4.6.0 for my flex projects, but i am using air 4.0.0.1628 for my air projects because it is massively better, offers massively faster compilation times and fixes any number of irritating bugs of earlier air sdks...</s><s> oh, and, it contains various features that are essential to be able to actually release any piece of software i make as it will meet the requirements of apple etc where the (outdated) version of air that ships with fb does not. 
</s><s>neither moving back to an earlier release of air nor moving back to flash builder 4.6 are possible as both would mean a drastic loss of function and dividing up my code-base so as to be unable to share significant libraries of code between projects. 
<quote>
<s>and, do you really need to compress your swf with lzma compression? 
</s></quote>
</s><s>unless you can show me a compiler argument in flash builder that will get it to do anything else, then yes i do.</s><s> that is the default behaviour for -compress=true in flash builder with the most current air and compiler.</s><s> using -compress=false is not an option as it knocks my swf from 250kb (which is acceptable) up to 750kb (which is not acceptable).</s><s> we looked at the license cost of third-party zipping tools and they were coming in at approximately $300 in order to generate a file of 325kb - in other words, we would be taking on a costly license to do something that we can already do, only not as well...</s><s> the other option is to home-cook an air desktop app to do the zipping / compression after the fact. 
i have not opted to do any specific form of file compression, this is what the default is for the compiler that was released by adobe.</s><s> i have not set any special compilation parameters.</s><s> i have not done anything other than keep my development tools up to date with the latest release from adobe. 
</s><s>it seems to me that this is an adobe issue and it is one that should be exceptionally easy for adobe to fix, where it is neither easy nor cheap for your customers to fix. 
i very much doubt that i am the only flex / flash developer who keeps his tools up to date and i anticipate that there will be more calls for you to resolve this if you do not resolve it now.

the problem is that we don t really know when to use authenticatewithtoken() if we call it on the drmstate.authenticating event it will loop and stack overflow because calling authenticatewithtoken will trigger the authenticating event so it will loop until it will stack overflow. 
i also tried to call it in authencation_needed (i had to modify to server code to return this event) but then custom token is never recieved by the server.

<subject>HSM (Hardware Security Module) Integration with the Reference Implementation License Server</subject>
<post author="Eric Ha" timestamp="Feb 6, 2014 3:18 PM">
<s>[ background ] adobe's compliance and robustness rules require a minimum level of protection for your private keys.  one of the ways to achieve the necessary protection outlined in the c&r rules is to employ an hsm to protect these assets.  this article will describe (at a high level) how to enable hsm support with the adobe access drm license server, which needs access to 2 private keys:   license server private key (this keypair is used to protect the cek, content encryption key, that is packaged into the protected content's metadata) transport private key (this keypair is used to protect requests sent to the license server, similar to ssl)   the reference implementation license server has built-in hsm support using the sun pkcs11 provider.  the purpose of this article is to walk through configuring the pkcs11 provider configuration file and then instructing the reference implementation server to retrieve the keys & certificates from the hsm.     [ references ] using the adobe access reference implementations (see the section "hsm configuration"): http://www.adobe.com/support/adobeaccess/pdfs/server/adobeaccess_4_ref impl.pdf   sun/oracle has the official reference on properly using their pkcs11 provider here: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/security/p11guide.html     [ workflow (adobe access reference implementation license server) ] set up your adobe access license server as per the "using the adobe access reference implementations" document.</s><s> for simplicity, adobe initially issues trial certificates to customers.  upon receiving your .p7b file from the adobe access certificate administrator, please following the deployment instructions to generate .pem/.der/.pfx files from the .p7b.  set up your license server & client to confirm that the server can handle license issuance with certificates (.pem/.der/.cer/.pfx) sitting on the license server's disk.</s><s> after it's been confirmed the license server is set up properly, we can proceed to integrating an hsm.  any hsm that is supported by sun's pkcs11 provider should work.  at adobe, hsms from lunasa and ncipher have been validated.</s><s> follow the hsm vendor's documentation on creating a csr (certificate signing request) on the hsm for each of your needed certificates (license server, transport, packager) send the csr to adobe (via the adobe access certificate portal) to issue you your certificates upload the certificates to your hsm & create the necessary aliases follow the "using the adobe access reference implementations" document's "hsm configuration" section to properly create a pkcs11.cfg file that works with your hsm an example pkcs11.cfg file is provided with the adobe access drm sdk in /reference implementation/server/resources/pkcs11.cfg update your license server's flashaccess-refimpl.properties file to turn on hsm usage via several properties in the "hsm properties" section set refimpl.hsm.enabled=true by viewing what was previously set in your .properties file when the server was functioning as-desired with your trial certificates, you can infer which properties must be set in the hsm configuration section.   **if you are using the "adobe access license server for protected streaming" server instead of the "reference implementation" the exact same pkcs11.cfg can be used.  however, configuration is via the tenant.xml xml configuration file, as apposed to the .properties file of the reference implementation.   **as of february 2014, the windows 64bit version of the oracle jdk7 does not properly support hsms, since the sun.security.pkcs11 package is missing from the jdk.  this will result in a classnotfoundexception when the license server attempts to generate a license.  if you see this, please use a 32bit version of the jdk, if you are using a 64bit version of windows.     [ real-world workflow of integrating a lunasa hsm (version 4.3.0) ]   hsm

one of the existing credentials on the hsm, or neither credential will be usable.  to determine if an id is  already in use, run:         >> cmu list -id=[idnum]   *note: as there can be many credentials stored on the hsm, it will be difficult to keep track of which id corresponds to which keypair.  to simplify things, please prepend the id# of your keypair to your  label.  to identify a free id# to use, simply find the largest labeled id# (step #7), and increment by 1.  verify that the id is not in use with the "cmu list -id=[idnum]" command.   **to view the existing id# or other

certificate to der format: >> openssl x509 -outform der -in certificate.pem -out certificate.der   5. import key into hsm.</s><s> you will be prompted for the hsm password.</s><s> >> cmu importkey -in

with the java sun pkcs11 provider (see note below regarding label names): >> cmu import -inputfile=certificate.der -label="certificate_publiccert"   7. to view the items on the hsm: >> cmu list   *8. to use the credential with the java sun pkcs11 provider, the private key and certificate must be assigned to the same identifier.  use:         >> cmu setattribute -handle=[handlenum] -id=[idnum] to set the same id for both the certificate and key (for example -id=11).</s><s> for the private key, also specify "-label=[labelname]" so you can distinguish one private key from another.</s><s> when you run the setattribute command, you will see a list of items on the hsm and will be prompted to enter the handle number of the object to update.  make sure you don't use an id that conflicts with one of the existing credentials on the hsm, or neither credential will be usable.  to determine if an id is  already in use, run:         >> cmu list -id=[idnum]   *note: as there can be many credentials stored on the hsm, it will be difficult to keep track of which id corresponds to which keypair.  to simplify things, please prepend the id# of your keypair to your  label.  to identify a free id# to use, simply find the largest labeled id# (step #7), and increment by 1.  verify that the id is not in use with the "cmu list -id=[idnum]" command.   **to view the existing id# or other attributes of any item, simply run the command "cmu getattribute"     (production users) creating a public/private keypair from your hsm and then a csr to send to adobe.</s><s> 1. generate a key pair using the hsm.  some hsms don't allow a single key to have multiple uses (signing, encrypting, etc...</s><s>).  our keys have multiple uses, so if your hsm has an issue with this, you may have to configure it to allow keys with multiple usages.</s><s> >> cmu gen -modulusbits=1024 -publicexponent=65537 -sign=t -decrypt=t -verify=t -encrypt=t -labelpublic="pubkey_label" -labelprivate="privkey_label"   2. generate a csr, using the handle for the private key generated in step 1:.</s><s> >> cmu requestcertificate -privatehandle=[private handlenum] -publichandle=[public handlenum] -outputfile=certrequest.csr   3. send the csr to the adobe access certificate admin, and wait for the certificate via email.</s><s> the cert will arrive as a pkcs#7 file (.p7b).  once the pkcs7 file is received, read the adobe certificate enrollment guide on how to deploy the p7b into .pem and .der files.   4.</s><s> follow steps 6-8 in the "uploading your certificates to the hsm" section to import the .der certificate to the hsm and associate it with the correct private key.  you can ignore steps 1-5 in the instructions since your private key is already on the hsm.
