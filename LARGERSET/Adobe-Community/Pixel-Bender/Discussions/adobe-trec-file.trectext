how to download & install pixel bender 
gavtrain 
the links he shows to download the program have changed, so in case you don't have the download anymore go to http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pixelbender.html then download pixel bender toolkit 2.5 for windows (zip, 59 mb) it is on the left under the icon proceed with the installation then be ready for the magic step 2 now from the same page that you just downloaded the pixel bender toolkit scroll down to the "archived downloads" and download pixel bender plug-in for photoshop cs5 (12.1) (win 32Ðbit) or pixel bender plug-in for photoshop cs5 (12.0) (win 32Ðbit) with all my tries i can't remember which one i tried. try 12.1 first, however you feel like once you have that follow the instruction of gavtrain in his video to open the plugin in administrator and tadaaaaa it will work, it did for me

<subject>Multiple Image inputs in Blendmode Shader</subject>
<post author="intravenus" timestamp="Jan 19, 2013 1:17 PM">
<s>i'm using 3 input images in a kernel destined to be used as a blendmode.shader.</s><s> as the documentation states, i have the background image as the first input, the foreground image (to whose bitmap i apply the blendmode) as the second input, and a third image which is to be used to transform the output colours.</s><s> the third image is passed to the shader by actionscript as per the documentation. 
</s><s>the shader works as it should in the pb toolkit, and also if i use it in a shaderjob, but if i use it as a blendmode it breaks down and the third input image seems to be the problem.

<s>it does, sort of.</s><s> i think i know what's going on now. 
i don't care about the input side of it: i'm only using the alpha of the input image, not the colour, so any premultiplication is being disregarded.</s><s> i can throw away the input alpha entirely and it still happens with a shader-generated alpha.</s><s> whatever it is is happening on output. 
</s><s>it seems it's also scaling the output, attempting to reverse the pre-multiplication so a pass-thru filter 
dst = samplenearest(oimage, relativepos); 
would have no effect.</s><s> to undo this i need to do the following 
float2 relativepos = outcoord(); pixel4 incol = samplenearest(oimage, relativepos); float fa = incol.a; dst = pixel4(0.0, relativepos.x * 0.005 * fa, relativepos.y * 0.005 * fa, fa); 
i.e. multiply each channel by the alpha which seems to work. 
i can't see this documented anywhere but the toolkit provides a clue: the preferences have a 'premultiply/unmultiply color by alpha' which says "flash player premultiplies each color by the alpha channel.</s><s> with this option checked, you will get a better approximation of running in flash player." except it seems to do nothing and be always on.</s><s> after that a bit of experimentation suggested what unmultiplying is.

<subject>Odd PB alpha handling in Flash</subject>
<post author="John%20Blackburne" timestamp="May 12, 2012 4:46 AM">
<s>it does, sort of.</s><s> i think i know what's going on now. 
i don't care about the input side of it: i'm only using the alpha of the input image, not the colour, so any premultiplication is being disregarded.</s><s> i can throw away the input alpha entirely and it still happens with a shader-generated alpha.</s><s> whatever it is is happening on output. 
</s><s>it seems it's also scaling the output, attempting to reverse the pre-multiplication so a pass-thru filter 
dst = samplenearest(oimage, relativepos); 
would have no effect.</s><s> to undo this i need to do the following 
float2 relativepos = outcoord(); pixel4 incol = samplenearest(oimage, relativepos); float fa = incol.a; dst = pixel4(0.0, relativepos.x * 0.005 * fa, relativepos.y * 0.005 * fa, fa); 
i.e. multiply each channel by the alpha which seems to work. 
i can't see this documented anywhere but the toolkit provides a clue: the preferences have a 'premultiply/unmultiply color by alpha' which says "flash player premultiplies each color by the alpha channel.</s><s> with this option checked, you will get a better approximation of running in flash player." except it seems to do nothing and be always on.</s><s> after that a bit of experimentation suggested what unmultiplying is.

sorry to dissapoint, but the toolkit doesn't support 32 bit image buffers in the gpu path and you'd want that for this application.</s><s> we support them under the hood when doing cpu path computations, but for what you want to do, there wouldn't be any point since gpu speed is what you're hoping for.
