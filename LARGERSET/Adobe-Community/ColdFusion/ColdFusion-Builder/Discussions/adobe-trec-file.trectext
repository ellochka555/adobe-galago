<s>charlie, thanks for your time and information responding to this issue.</s><s> they were helpful to track down what the problem is. 
</s><s>based on the information you gave me above i noticed the following. 
</s><s>under the progress view what i see when closing a file are messages related to building workspace as the picture below shows. 

</s><s>as for folding.data file, i followed your advice and opened in a text editor.</s><s> the file content has, like you said, some binary data, but also contains the strings "file:" followed by the full path for the files that i closed.</s><s> i looked at the size of it and it was 11k with about 11 lines.</s><s> then i started to open and close some file and noticed that cfbuilder was writing the names of all the files i close to the folding.data file, which increased the file size.</s><s> now the file has 14 lines and 14k.</s><s> the previous folding.data files had size varying from 38k to 87k.</s><s> i also note that the cfbuilder was not appending the most recent files to folding.data as the path for the most recent closed files were in the middle of the file content.</s><s> it seems that cfbuilder was not only updating but re-creating the file with the previous content and the string with the new file path in a random fashion. 
</s><s>when i said that the closing of the files is initially faster and then gets slower, i meant to say that is faster when i delete the folding.data file and cfbuilder creates a new one.</s><s> as cfbuilder starts updating the folding.data file it gets slower.</s><s> after that it continues slow even in between cfbuilder sessions.so i think that might be a threshold related to the file size that makes the process of closing files slow.</s><s> i don't think the problem is related to memory as i already had the show heap status view on display and even when there is not much use of memory closing the file is still slow. 
</s><s>at this point what it looks like is that the process of closing a file inside cfbuilder updates the folding.data file and when that file reaches a particular size, it takes some time to actually close the file as if cfbuilder was waiting for the folding.data file to be updated.</s><s> what intrigues me is the fact that this behavior happened in w different pc's so it has to be something related to the setting of cfbulder in handling the closing of files. 
i was wondering if there is some sort of setting related to closing files in cfbuilder. 
</s><s>once again, thank you very much for your responses.

<s>glad to hear that the info helped.</s><s> and yes, that info on the files is what i meant, when i said, "i can see references to files (some currently open, others that i've long ago closed)." 
</s><s>so as for the size, i would say that these file sizes you are mentioning seem too small to be significant, but who knows.</s><s> here's a potentially interesting question: where are the files (the foldings.data file), relative to cfb?</s><s> are they in a folder on the same drive as cfb?</s><s> in another location, like a network drive, or a mapped drive that may be on the network? 
</s><s>also, you mention the build workspace info in the progress view.</s><s> that's just the sort of thing i was talking about might explain what was amiss. 
</s><s>related to that, you ask about features which may affect file closing, but while there is in fact a setting that affects startup and that building of workspaces (preferences>coldfusion>server settings), none of them are related to file closing. 
i hope that perhaps someone from adobe will pick up on this and offer you more info, either based on something they may know, or other diagnostics you can undertake.

<s>sure, but i wonder if your doing that could still be stored in that foldings.data on the network. 
</s><s>try opening a new workspace, whose location is not on the network.</s><s> see if that may not make a difference.</s><s> (for most cf devs, the workspace location is not really important to how they code, so it should not hurt other than that you will lose any config settings you made.</s><s> but you can always open the original workspace to get back to that point if you prefer.</s><s>)

<s>i found this thread after experiencing the slow file closing issue at a new job where the website files are all stored on a network drive.</s><s> i realized that the workspace files are also stored on a network drive.</s><s> i'm in a windows environment where the user's files are stored on a server.</s><s> so when i installed cf builder 2, it automatically put the workspace directory in my user's directory which is on the server.

</s><s>as for folding.data file, i followed your advice and opened in a text editor.</s><s> the file content has, like you said, some binary data, but also contains the strings "file:" followed by the full path for the files that i closed.</s><s> i looked at the size of it and it was 11k with about 11 lines.</s><s> then i started to open and close some file and noticed that cfbuilder was writing the names of all the files i close to the folding.data file, which increased the file size.</s><s> now the file has 14 lines and 14k.</s><s> the previous folding.data files had size varying from 38k to 87k.</s><s> i also note that the cfbuilder was not appending the most recent files to folding.data as the path for the most recent closed files were in the middle of the file content.</s><s> it seems that cfbuilder was not only updating but re-creating the file with the previous content and the string with the new file path in a random fashion. 
</s><s>when i said that the closing of the files is initially faster and then gets slower, i meant to say that is faster when i delete the folding.data file and cfbuilder creates a new one.</s><s> as cfbuilder starts updating the folding.data file it gets slower.</s><s> after that it continues slow even in between cfbuilder sessions.so i think that might be a threshold related to the file size that makes the process of closing files slow.</s><s> i don't think the problem is related to memory as i already had the show heap status view on display and even when there is not much use of memory closing the file is still slow. 
</s><s>at this point what it looks like is that the process of closing a file inside cfbuilder updates the folding.data file and when that file reaches a particular size, it takes some time to actually close the file as if cfbuilder was waiting for the folding.data file to be updated.</s><s> what intrigues me is the fact that this behavior happened in w different pc's so it has to be something related to the setting of cfbulder in handling the closing of files. 
i was wondering if there is some sort of setting related to closing files in cfbuilder. 
</s><s>once again, thank you very much for your responses.

<s>glad to hear that the info helped.</s><s> and yes, that info on the files is what i meant, when i said, "i can see references to files (some currently open, others that i've long ago closed)." 
</s><s>so as for the size, i would say that these file sizes you are mentioning seem too small to be significant, but who knows.</s><s> here's a potentially interesting question: where are the files (the foldings.data file), relative to cfb?</s><s> are they in a folder on the same drive as cfb?</s><s> in another location, like a network drive, or a mapped drive that may be on the network? 
</s><s>also, you mention the build workspace info in the progress view.</s><s> that's just the sort of thing i was talking about might explain what was amiss. 
</s><s>related to that, you ask about features which may affect file closing, but while there is in fact a setting that affects startup and that building of workspaces (preferences>coldfusion>server settings), none of them are related to file closing. 
i hope that perhaps someone from adobe will pick up on this and offer you more info, either based on something they may know, or other diagnostics you can undertake.

<s>sure, but i wonder if your doing that could still be stored in that foldings.data on the network. 
</s><s>try opening a new workspace, whose location is not on the network.</s><s> see if that may not make a difference.</s><s> (for most cf devs, the workspace location is not really important to how they code, so it should not hurt other than that you will lose any config settings you made.</s><s> but you can always open the original workspace to get back to that point if you prefer.</s><s>)

<s>i found this thread after experiencing the slow file closing issue at a new job where the website files are all stored on a network drive.</s><s> i realized that the workspace files are also stored on a network drive.</s><s> i'm in a windows environment where the user's files are stored on a server.</s><s> so when i installed cf builder 2, it automatically put the workspace directory in my user's directory which is on the server. 
</s><s>after reading this thread i decided to try moving the workspace to my local c: drive.</s><s> i closed all projects and then went into windows - preferences and filtered on "works".</s><s> under startup and shutdown there is a workspace setting: "prompt for workspace on startup".</s><s> this was unchecked because i had previously told cf builder to just always use the default.</s><s> i then closed cf builder. 
i copied the adobe coldfusion builder workspace directory from the server share to a new directory on my c: drive.</s><s> then i restarted cf builder.</s><s> it prompted for the workspace where i browsed for the new directory and again checked the "use this as default...".

<s>i downloaded and installed the cf builder 2 (version: 2.0.1 build: 282422) and almost daily (but not at any regular time or interval) it hangs, then i have to manually kill the process, and often lose some work.</s><s> when this happens the cpu resources get pegged at 100% or more by the coldfusion builder 2 process.</s><s> i can't identify any specific operation that appears to cause this either; i'm almost always just typing code when the freeze occurs. 
</s><s>i'm on mac osx 10.9, 16gb ram 
</s><s>has anyone else experienced this?</s><s> any work arounds out there? 
</s><s>i'm going to be running out of free trial time and unfortunately there is no way i can justify paying for this product.</s><s> i was using dreamweaver (which i still like and may go back to) but has anyone else seen/used a good cfml editor?

<s>@pdx.tjk, i realize you're new to cf but i do feel some corrections are warranted.</s><s> first, we're talking here about cfbuilder, not coldfusion (whose newest version is the "10" you refer to). 
</s><s>second, maximizing profitability is a primary goal for nearly any publicly held company in a capitalist economy.</s><s> that's not to say that other factors, like customer service, need to slip, or should be allowed to.
