<post author="slevy566" timestamp="Jul 12, 2012 4:35 PM">
<s>my setup iis7 windows 2008 r2 with coldfusion 9 on a virtual server, using windows authentication.</s><s> windows authentication worked perfectly in the previous version of iis and on a conventional server setup and coldfusion 8.</s><s> now when a person without permission requests a file in a protected folder, they are denied all files except the .cfm file.</s><s> that file displays all the text. 
</s><s>since this is iis7 there is no "check that file exists setting" but this is supposed to be handled through the handler mappings.</s><s> the wildcard is mapped as well as the .cfm, .cfml etc specific extensions. 
</s><s>documentation says: how does the coldfusion service interact with iis in terms of security?</s><s> cf runs as a separate service, but it also integrates with iis using an isapi extension.</s><s> the isapi extension runs in-process with iis, just like the asp engine, and when a request is received that is mapped to the file extension associated with the isapi extension (typically .cfm and .dbm, although those can be changed in the iis management console), the request is forwarded to the cf service for processing.</s><s> iis and nt security are used to determine whether the user can request the file in the first place.</s><s> this happens before the request is forwarded to the cf service.</s><s> so, you'll generally follow the same procedure for securing cf applications with acls that you would with an asp application.

<s>my setup iis7 windows 2008 r2 with coldfusion 9 on a virtual server, using windows authentication.</s><s> windows authentication worked perfectly in the previous version of iis and on a conventional server setup and coldfusion 8.</s><s> now when a person without permission requests a file in a protected folder, they are denied all files except the .cfm file.</s><s> that file displays all the text. 
</s><s>since this is iis7 there is no "check that file exists setting" but this is supposed to be handled through the handler mappings.</s><s> the wildcard is mapped as well as the .cfm, .cfml etc specific extensions. 
</s><s>documentation says: how does the coldfusion service interact with iis in terms of security?</s><s> cf runs as a separate service, but it also integrates with iis using an isapi extension.</s><s> the isapi extension runs in-process with iis, just like the asp engine, and when a request is received that is mapped to the file extension associated with the isapi extension (typically .cfm and .dbm, although those can be changed in the iis management console), the request is forwarded to the cf service for processing.</s><s> iis and nt security are used to determine whether the user can request the file in the first place.</s><s> this happens before the request is forwarded to the cf service.</s><s> so, you'll generally follow the same procedure for securing cf applications with acls that you would with an asp application. 
</s><s>what am i overlooking?</s><s> any suggestions?

<s>please bear with me as i am primariliy a systems and network admin as opposed to a developer.   we are in the process of migrating our code from cf8 to cf10, and the inhouse developers are complaining about one error they cant figure out.  we have a page that uses cfgrid to call a cfc.   this cfc throws an error about a request variable being undefined, however i do se that it is defined in the debigging information of the parent page.    error invoking cfc at /todynamic/display/admin sitecampuses.cfc : element fuseboxosname is undefined in request.   i know we are using an older version of fusebox, but it would be a monstrous task to upgrade it at this point.   any suggestions?

<s>there's no client data or anything sensitive here, its simply a configuration screen.  and like i said, its a dev server on a private network - not public.   the cfcs are very simple, and do not have any includes.   so accessing them should not be calling fbx_settings.cfm or fbx_layouts.cfm.   it must be something in the way it passes the parameters.  if i pass the cfc url variables, it happily return the data correctly, without any includes (or errors)   for instance, this is broken: http://admin.absbook.cf10/todynamic/display/admin/sitecampuses.cfc?met hod=getebookpricingoptions&_cf_ajaxproxytoken=67e4609e9e8a7f998867&ret urnformat=json&argumentcollection=%7b%22ebookvendorid%22%3a%222%22%2c% 22selectedebookpricingid%22%3a%221%22%7d&_cf_nodebug=true&_cf_nocache= true&_cf_clientid=0e09335044a83c729fd95ae3ef8aa869&_cf_rc=0     this works as expected: http://admin.absbook.cf10/todynamic/display/admin/sitecampuses.cfc?met hod=getebookpricingoptions&ebookvendorid=2&selectedebookpricingid=1

<s>hopefully someone more versed in cfajaxproxy and cfgrid can chime in (i've never used either).</s><s> i generally try to avoid using coldfusion's built-in ui stuff because it is inherently limited (only the pieces of underlying libraries that they chose to implement are available) and way behind in versions (i think the cfgrid stuff is based on a really old version of extjs). 
i much prefer to use a modern javascript library for ui controls and use things like jquery to handle ajax - it's much simpler and you have more control that way.</s><s> there is a project on github that attempts to help people do ui without coldfusion's rather poor ui tags: https://github.com/cfjedimaster/coldfusion-ui-the-right-way, although there isn't an example yet for cfgrid (take a look at cftable though, as there's a link from there to the excellent datatables plugin for jquery).</s><s> another jquery alternative is the jqgrid plugin, and there are also grids in the extjs and dojo libraries.

<s>i hope nothing that exposes security issues was in all that stuff!

exceptions 16:00:24.024 - missinginclude exception - in /var/www/html/dynamic/fbx_fusebox30_cf50.cfm : line 276 could not find the included template circuits/admin/fbx_layouts.cfm. 

might be the starting point.</s><s> do you have a fbx_layouts.cfm file somewhere in your application?</s><s> is it in a different place than circuits/admin/ ?</s><s> if so, you need to update the path in the include statement in fbx_fusebox30_cf50.cfm (especially if this file is what sets the value of request.fuseboxosname.

<s>there's no client data or anything sensitive here, its simply a configuration screen.  and like i said, its a dev server on a private network - not public.   the cfcs are very simple, and do not have any includes.   so accessing them should not be calling fbx_settings.cfm or fbx_layouts.cfm.   it must be something in the way it passes the parameters.  if i pass the cfc url variables, it happily return the data correctly, without any includes (or errors)   for instance, this is broken: http://admin.absbook.cf10/todynamic/display/admin/sitecampuses.cfc?met hod=getebookpricingoptions&_cf_ajaxproxytoken=67e4609e9e8a7f998867&ret urnformat=json&argumentcollection=%7b%22ebookvendorid%22%3a%222%22%2c% 22selectedebookpricingid%22%3a%221%22%7d&_cf_nodebug=true&_cf_nocache= true&_cf_clientid=0e09335044a83c729fd95ae3ef8aa869&_cf_rc=0     this works as expected: http://admin.absbook.cf10/todynamic/display/admin/sitecampuses.cfc?met hod=getebookpricingoptions&ebookvendorid=2&selectedebookpricingid=1

<s>hopefully someone more versed in cfajaxproxy and cfgrid can chime in (i've never used either).</s><s> i generally try to avoid using coldfusion's built-in ui stuff because it is inherently limited (only the pieces of underlying libraries that they chose to implement are available) and way behind in versions (i think the cfgrid stuff is based on a really old version of extjs). 
i much prefer to use a modern javascript library for ui controls and use things like jquery to handle ajax - it's much simpler and you have more control that way.</s><s> there is a project on github that attempts to help people do ui without coldfusion's rather poor ui tags: https://github.com/cfjedimaster/coldfusion-ui-the-right-way, although there isn't an example yet for cfgrid (take a look at cftable though, as there's a link from there to the excellent datatables plugin for jquery).</s><s> another jquery alternative is the jqgrid plugin, and there are also grids in the extjs and dojo libraries.

</s><s>if you choose the built-in option, then try using the webaddress as localhost:8500 in web browser and test. 
</s><s>also, check the hosts file (c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc) as well
