<s>hi liam Ê thanks for replying.</s><s> it is meant to be an easy to use wywsiwyg editor but really you need coding knowledge to be able to create forms other than one long list Ê i wanted to have the same design ease as in muse or form central Ê i spent a long time on chat session with support and it seems the best solution is to have contact forms created with muse widget but still to use form central for things like gift voucher order forms Ê the contact form details can be added to an existing mailing list in bc through using reports>custom reports>add customer report> customers and cases> select the fields you want like customer name, default address type, email 1 >then choose filter 1 case subject = then type the name of the muse form you want the data from + select from custom crm form filter drop down list the same muse form you want. then his generate report.</s><s> it will give you a report of all customers who have completed that form. you can then select 'add customers to' and choose the mailing list you have created and they will be added Ê it is a very long process to do somethig that should integrate straight from muse forms into whatever mailing list you have pre chosen.</s><s> eg. when desiging a form in muse where it has option to choose the email address it send results to, it should also have an option to choose the bc mailing list you would like their name added to would be logical. Ê i hope this can be sorted out in the near future with muse as the rest of the program i do like.

<s>not when it comes to this sort of thing.</s><s> your heading into the proper realms of websites and customability and that involes coding.</s><s> thats what my job is and why i get paid 
i am suprised support would have advised you to do that, is that because you will only use drag and drop creation, is that what you said?</s><s> they would have advised using bc to get the data in and through bc. 
</s><s>to add a mailing list you just add that to the form and you can have that pre-selected with checked="checked" to that input checkbox. 
</s><s>in terms of the reports, i know bc quite well, i know how they work 
you need to understand that while muse is always improving and i appreciate the teams work and it has helped a lot of graphic designers build some form of website...</s><s> it is a point and click tool, it is not really going to build websites for you, it is only a stepping stone and there is the point where you need to start learning the trade. 
</s><s>it is like building a house, you and i can buy all these home fancy tools that do this and that easier like nail guns etc, we can download a house plan and google etc...</s><s> does not mean we will do a good job though, proper tradies though would laugh at us and of course would do a better job million times over.

<s>hi liam Ê thanks for replying.</s><s> it is meant to be an easy to use wywsiwyg editor but really you need coding knowledge to be able to create forms other than one long list Ê i wanted to have the same design ease as in muse or form central Ê i spent a long time on chat session with support and it seems the best solution is to have contact forms created with muse widget but still to use form central for things like gift voucher order forms Ê the contact form details can be added to an existing mailing list in bc through using reports>custom reports>add customer report> customers and cases> select the fields you want like customer name, default address type, email 1 >then choose filter 1 case subject = then type the name of the muse form you want the data from + select from custom crm form filter drop down list the same muse form you want. then his generate report.</s><s> it will give you a report of all customers who have completed that form. you can then select 'add customers to' and choose the mailing list you have created and they will be added Ê it is a very long process to do somethig that should integrate straight from muse forms into whatever mailing list you have pre chosen.</s><s> eg. when desiging a form in muse where it has option to choose the email address it send results to, it should also have an option to choose the bc mailing list you would like their name added to would be logical. Ê i hope this can be sorted out in the near future with muse as the rest of the program i do like.

<s>not when it comes to this sort of thing.</s><s> your heading into the proper realms of websites and customability and that involes coding.</s><s> thats what my job is and why i get paid 
i am suprised support would have advised you to do that, is that because you will only use drag and drop creation, is that what you said?</s><s> they would have advised using bc to get the data in and through bc. 
</s><s>to add a mailing list you just add that to the form and you can have that pre-selected with checked="checked" to that input checkbox. 
</s><s>in terms of the reports, i know bc quite well, i know how they work 
you need to understand that while muse is always improving and i appreciate the teams work and it has helped a lot of graphic designers build some form of website...</s><s> it is a point and click tool, it is not really going to build websites for you, it is only a stepping stone and there is the point where you need to start learning the trade. 
</s><s>it is like building a house, you and i can buy all these home fancy tools that do this and that easier like nail guns etc, we can download a house plan and google etc...</s><s> does not mean we will do a good job though, proper tradies though would laugh at us and of course would do a better job million times over.
