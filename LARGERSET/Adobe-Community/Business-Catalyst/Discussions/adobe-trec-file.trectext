<s>hi franco, Ê with how business catalyst works, you can achieve the following scenario: Ê from e-mail will be a unique address setup within the workflow associated to the webform.</s><s> reply-to will be the customer's e-mail, as entered in the form.</s><s> subject will be: default is: "workflow notification - the webform name" but you can customize this to contain just a system tag.</s><s> out of the available system tags, you can use "tag_worfklow name" which will output the name of the workflow assigned.</s><s> since you can have multiple workflows available, if you name each workflow as the respective product, than you can achieve your goal here, assuming the subject can take a fixed, generic form Ê body will contain the field message but will also contain the rest of the form summary.</s><s> to will be a different contact or set of contacts, as you can actually trigger separate workflow based on user selection, as seen here: http://helpx.adobe.com/tiness-catalyst/partner/create-workflow-notific ation.html#id_22857 Ê Ê here's a small graphic to better explain the above: http://screencasteu.worldsecuresystems.com/ap/webforms_workflows.jpg Ê kind regards, alex

<s>hi franco, 
</s><s>here's what happens when i hit reply to a workflow notification i received after filling in a basic webform: http://prntscr.com/306coz
