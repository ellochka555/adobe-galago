<subject>Looking for a compressor for Soundbooth CS5</subject>
<post author="adob1948" timestamp="Jul 8, 2013 10:19 AM">
<s>when making a voice recording for a e learning project 6 month ago i used in audition 6 a compressor to eliminate my breath.</s><s> it was a compressor inside audition with best result for me when using an in/out relation in db as a s curve and expanding above 35 db and reducing the input below below 35 db to eliminate the noise level and my breath.</s><s> i found it very useful to drag and drop the in/out amplification curve with the mouse and smooth my setting points at the end with a build i function. 
</s><s>now in a new company i am restricted to soundbooth cs5 and a decision will made on final license situation if/when captivate will be a product to buy or to license in the cloud. 
</s><s>is there a vst compressor like in audition 6, free or comercial?</s><s> thanks a lot

<s>i have a 24-bit wave file that is 45 minutes long that i recorded on a zoom h4n handheld.</s><s> i put it on my computer.</s><s> the sound does not work in itunes, windows media, audacity, soundbooth, vlc, etc. the waveform looks totally normal (around -12db).</s><s> correction - i can now hear sound in vlc, if i crank every sound setting i have to 11 and put my ear right next to the speaker, i can barely hear it.</s><s> i can boost the audio but there has to be a setting i have incorrect.</s><s> why else would the waveform be showing normal?
