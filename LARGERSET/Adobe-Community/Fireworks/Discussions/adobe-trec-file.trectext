<s>er zijn verscheidene redenen waarom het niet zoveel zin heeft om je druk te maken over zogenoemde "veilige" webkleuren:

4) de hoop dat de veilige webkleuren identiek zouden worden weergegeven op alle schermen en systemen is een utopie: het hangt van zoveel factoren af (hardware beperkingen, of het scherm kleurgecalibreerd is, de hoek van waar het scherm wordt bekeken, en zoveel meer) dat dit ook geen zin heeft.

<s>hi carey, thanks for the response. 
</s><s>ok so interestingly i am home now, i was able to get this to work just fine on my laptop with the same os.</s><s> i had cs5.5 from my subscription installed on both, then last night i uninstallted that on both, and installed all the apps from creative cloud. 
</s><s>when i try it here i dont have the larger fireworks png available to paste into but i rdp'd back ot my office and tried with a blank document importing a logo it failed, so i dont think it is with the document i am trying to import into as it doesnt work with a blank file at my office. 
i am sharing a file that i am having a problem working with. http://dev.rofsky.com/debug/grad.ai 
it failes when i use edit paste, and keyboard shortcuts, as well as import from the file menu.</s><s> it doesnt even pop up the window that asks you about import options. 
i have no problem pasting the same item into photoshop. 
</s><s>this laptop that it works on is a dell e6420 with intel onboard graphics, the workstation has a evga gtx 460 . not sure if that would make much of a difference? 
</s><s>both computers are good hardware, genuine os and software all around with all service packs and updates installed.

i had the same issue as the others on this post.</s><s> i found a solution: 
1. the problem seems to be related with apple quicktime installation.</s><s> so if you have quicktime installed, just uninstall it and everything will works fine again: you can import your .ai files to fireworks.</s><s> 2. this worked for me: i tried to reinstall quicktime (because i use after effects) and everything are still working.</s><s> 3. in case you don't use after effects try to download k-lite codec pack as an alternative to quicktime

<s>you may use a proved way of ai file restoration.</s><s> owing to illustrator repair toolbox you can simultaneously open some .ai files, including cs6 files version.

in case this method wouldn't be effective, see necessary actions of alternative .ai opening

<s>hi there, 
i had the same issue as the others on this post.</s><s> i found a solution: 
1. the problem seems to be related with apple quicktime installation.</s><s> so if you have quicktime installed, just uninstall it and everything will works fine again: you can import your .ai files to fireworks.</s><s> 2. this worked for me: i tried to reinstall quicktime (because i use after effects) and everything are still working.</s><s> 3. in case you don't use after effects try to download k-lite codec pack as an alternative to quicktime 
hopefully it helps someone!

<s>you may use a proved way of ai file restoration.</s><s> owing to illustrator repair toolbox you can simultaneously open some .ai files, including cs6 files version. 
</s><s>tool is placed at next source: http://www.illustrator.repairtoolbox.com/ 
in case this method wouldn't be effective, see necessary actions of alternative .ai opening 
to attempt recovery using illustrator itself: 
1) create a new document 2) select "place image" ( file > place- ) 3) choose your corrupted file in the dialog box.</s><s> make sure you choose file types to " all documents ", not just recommended.</s><s> 4) save this file.</s><s> if you cannot save this file (due to corruption), copy your vectors and paste them into a new illustrator document. 
</s><s>pros: you should be able to select the corrupted file, and your vector work should be saved. 
</s><s>cons: all layers will be flattened into one.</s><s> pms color info and placed images may be lost.</s><s> file may still be corrupted.

<s>a difficult question to answer - i guess it depends on your preferred workflow and how you used fireworks.</s><s> fireworks, no matter how you looked at it, did get quite old in the teeth - workflows have changed quite a bit nowadays, and fw was not keeping up.</s><s> adobe is, i think, hoping to have photoshop replace it.</s><s> but that is not quite the best option right now. 
i found a good replacement in photoline, although it is still missing a couple of things crucial to web dev.</s><s> the good things are full svg support (import and export), export of (selected) layers, pages, good (real) vector tools, pixel alignment for vector layers, virtual copies of layers, excellent bitmap tools (comparable to ps), good guides, good alignment tools, patterns, a built-in procedural texture maker, document colours (newest beta), pixel view, anti-aliasing control per layer, great down-scaling algorithms, and so on.</s><s> i use qolor quantizer and riot for web graphics optimization. 
</s><s>the things missing are: slicing (which i never used anymore anyway - all layer based workflow now); symbols (though virtual layers work as a workaround); a general pixel alignment setting; no html/css output (which i never need anyway). 
</s><s>it can do much more than fireworks, but for pure web work it is still missing some things.</s><s> the devs are very open to suggestions, though, and so far have been adding a lot of useful web functionality.</s><s> it can only improve, in my opinion. 
</s><s>this works for me.</s><s> i also work with xara designer pro - which does have full html/css export if required.</s><s> there is also xara webdesigner (pro) (designer pro includes all that functionality). 
</s><s>soon the first version of evolveui will be out: http://tribaloid.com/ it sounds like the perfect fw replacement.</s><s> as a matter of fact, that project was started by disgruntled ex-fw users. 
</s><s>of course, you could switch to photoshop - but that is still too awkward for web work, in my opinion.</s><s> illustrator could also be an option.</s><s> even indesign can be used for working web prototypes.</s><s> but none of these are truly optimized for web work. 
</s><s>in short, do your own research; download the trial version, play around, and see if they do what you need in your web work.
