<s>hi - 
</s><s>i'd like to get more information about the issue you're encountering. 
1.</s><s> "as soon as i hit ingest the program just closes." -- does it mean when you hit the "ingest" button on the top right corner of the application to open the ingest dialog?</s><s> 2. does the crash also happen when you double click on the empty area on the project panel or when you use "cmd+i" to open the ingest dialog?</s><s> 3. could you provide the os version as well?</s><s> 4. did this happen before you update to prelude 2.2?</s><s> i saw you said "this started after the update yesterday", this is for your confirmation.
