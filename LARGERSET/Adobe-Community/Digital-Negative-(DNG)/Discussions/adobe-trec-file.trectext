<s>this is what your camera does when adl is enabled: 
* assesses highlight clipping, and based on assessment, drops exposure to some extent. 
</s><s>so, net result raw-data-wise: possibly reduced exposure (nothing else, except adl setting jotted down in the metadata). 
</s><s>it (your camera) then proceeds to boost exposure in conjunction with intelligent contrast reduction and bakes that into the jpeg preview - making for nice jpegs, and one of the reasons people sometimes prefer in-camera jpegs to acr's default processing, which doesn't do stuff like that automatically, by default... 
(note: viewnx and nx2 can replicate what your camera does, after the fact, when shooting raw). 
</s><s>so, you can still take full advantage of adl in a raw-only acr-centric workflow simply by applying a preset, e.g. 
+exposure -highlights +shadows 
in other words, you get the benefit of in-camera intelligence which judicially reduces exposure to preserve highlights, but you have to do the compensatory processing in acr somehow. 
</s><s>most people just turn adl off, and keep an eye on their exposure, but i hear ya: adl still has value even if raw-converter/processor ignores it. 
i have implemented camera emulation in ottomanic importer (for nd300-like cameras only: respects in-camera profile, adl, ...</s><s> ), but i don't use it m'self - not sure how many people do use it. 
</s><s>another option (post-import) is to use exifmeta to smart-collect on various adl settings, then use collectionpreseter to auto-apply the compensatory settings. 
</s><s>personally, i don't think it's worth the trouble, but you might. 
</s><s>that's probably the best you'll be able to do for now. 
</s><s>to be clear: it makes very little sense (in my opinion) in a acr-centric workflow to save tiffs in nikon software, in order to take advantage of adl - acr's highlight & shadow controls are better than what nikon does for intelligent contrast reduction, and it's easy enough to boost exposure when under-exposed - ya gotta do that anyway, when called for, regardless of adl...

<s>it's not gonna happen.

<s>this is what your camera does when adl is enabled: 
* assesses highlight clipping, and based on assessment, drops exposure to some extent. 
</s><s>so, net result raw-data-wise: possibly reduced exposure (nothing else, except adl setting jotted down in the metadata). 
</s><s>it (your camera) then proceeds to boost exposure in conjunction with intelligent contrast reduction and bakes that into the jpeg preview - making for nice jpegs, and one of the reasons people sometimes prefer in-camera jpegs to acr's default processing, which doesn't do stuff like that automatically, by default... 
(note: viewnx and nx2 can replicate what your camera does, after the fact, when shooting raw). 
</s><s>so, you can still take full advantage of adl in a raw-only acr-centric workflow simply by applying a preset, e.g. 
+exposure -highlights +shadows 
in other words, you get the benefit of in-camera intelligence which judicially reduces exposure to preserve highlights, but you have to do the compensatory processing in acr somehow. 
</s><s>most people just turn adl off, and keep an eye on their exposure, but i hear ya: adl still has value even if raw-converter/processor ignores it. 
i have implemented camera emulation in ottomanic importer (for nd300-like cameras only: respects in-camera profile, adl, ...</s><s> ), but i don't use it m'self - not sure how many people do use it. 
</s><s>another option (post-import) is to use exifmeta to smart-collect on various adl settings, then use collectionpreseter to auto-apply the compensatory settings. 
</s><s>personally, i don't think it's worth the trouble, but you might. 
</s><s>that's probably the best you'll be able to do for now. 
</s><s>to be clear: it makes very little sense (in my opinion) in a acr-centric workflow to save tiffs in nikon software, in order to take advantage of adl - acr's highlight & shadow controls are better than what nikon does for intelligent contrast reduction, and it's easy enough to boost exposure when under-exposed - ya gotta do that anyway, when called for, regardless of adl...

<subject>DNG converter: what's the command line to "Skip source image if exists" option?</subject>
<post author="Pedro Marques" timestamp="Jan 16, 2014 8:32 AM">
<s>i'm using adobe dng converter 8.3.0.141 to convert more then a million of raw images in thousands of diferent folders. 
</s><s>it is working well, but first i must prepare and rename with a script some of the folders and then collect all the paths to a xml file.</s><s> in each folder path i temporary put a bat file (windows7) that is my command file and my script will wait for for the bat to finish and then delete the raws and goes to the next pre-processed folder collected from the xml.</s><s> i had to rush a bit and i have manage to use several pcs running the batch and it is running ok. 
</s><s>how can i use inside the bat file command to activate: "skip source image if destination image already exists"?</s><s> the need for this is because sometimes the raw files are not deleted after the conversion and it will collect again that folder to convert again.</s><s> so i need to tell not to convert if already exist. 
</s><s>and please, why adobe puts on-line an old and incomplete pdf manual for the cammand line tags: http://wwwimages.adobe.com/www.adobe.com/content/dam/adobe/en/products /photoshop/pdfs/dng_commandline.pdf

<s>what makes you think there is such an option?</s><s> i would guess there isn't, or in any case, to the best of my knowledge, it's never been documented (nor have i ever heard of it, or found it via dumping symbols...</s><s>).</s><s> 
</s><s>that said, dng converter *does* support doing one file at a time (pass file on command line), so another option is to put the "intelligence" for avoiding pre-existing files in your bat or js file. 
ps: +1 vote for adobe updating the documentation - not sure what to make of the years-old doc there .

<s>hi, i am not knowing the direct answer to your question (command line option to skip existing destinations). 
</s><s>however, i found a few command line options not being documented: 
-x extract original or so (just guessing from the error message) -lossy enable lossy compression (full resolution) -count <number> enable lossy compression with that <number> many pixels (e.g., 16200000 for 16.2mp), ui only offers 15mp here! -side <number> enable lossy compression with that <number> many pixels along the long side (e.g., 1920 for hd) 
i see a symbol "skipalreadyconverted" for the ui but didn't find an option to trigger it.

<s>hello german jack, excuse me but i've discovered just now that lr and acr don't consider custom profile build from jpg to develop any raw file (doesn't appear the option in lens list) so, sure, if i can't produce anything other that a jpg profile (because of the crash of lens profile creator with dng file on my pc) i have to correct the raw option in "true" if i want use my profile in lr with raw file.</s><s> i didn't know it before today.</s><s> thank you for your suggestion.</s><s> bye

<s>camera raw and the dng converter are not the same thing.</s><s> adobe camera raw is a plug-in that is part of photoshop and photoshop elements.</s><s> its purpose is to open and allow you to make modifications to the raw image data contained in your raw files taken by your camera.</s><s> the dng converter is not part of photoshop elements, not part of adobe camera raw, it does not allow you to do anything other than create digital negative (dng) copies of your raw files.</s><s> some people like to use the dng converter routinely and automatically convert all their raw files to dng.</s><s> a dng file contains all of the raw image data that was in the original raw file created by the camera.</s><s> but the dng file is a standardized format that adobe has created.</s><s> their argument is that it simplifies raw processing and assures that your files will be usable in the future.</s><s> the only problem with that argument, from my perspective, is that it limits the software that can be used primarily to adobe products.</s><s> many other products do not support the dng format.</s><s> i don't convert to dng because adobe camera raw supports my cameras.</s><s> the only time i would ever consider converting to dng is if i had an older version of lightroom or camera raw that didn't support the raw format from a new camera. 

</s><s>now, the question to you is, are you really using the separate, freestanding, independent dng converter, or are you talking about dng conversion from within photoshop elements?</s><s> there is a difference, a big difference.</s><s> have you specifically downloaded and installed the dng converter, or are you simply trying to work within photoshop elements?</s><s> this must be clarified if we are going to make any progress.
