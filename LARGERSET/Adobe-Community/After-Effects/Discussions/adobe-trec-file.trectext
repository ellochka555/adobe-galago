<s>hello todd, for the past few years i've been reading through many of your posts as well as harm millaard's posts about how to properly set up and upgrade your pc while keeping everything balanced.</s><s> i followed the advice of upgrading the processor to an i7-3930k and oc'd it to 4.5+ghz as well as achieved 500+mb/s transfer rates for my media and scratch disks on separate hard drives and i'm almost done maxing out my ram.</s><s> with all that said i am now at the last piece to the build.</s><s> the gpu.</s><s> 
</s><s>i've spent a crazy amount of hours reading through as many articles as i possibly can as well as posting in multiple forums to shine some light on this decision and have narrowed it down to either the gtx 770 (4gb) or the gtx 780 (not the ti).</s><s> most people would say to just get the gtx 780 if cost isn't an issue, but here is my dilemma, i frequently use many high polycount 3d bodies in my work.</s><s> either ray-traced right in ae or with the element 3d plugin. 
</s><s>the question that no one can seem to answer is "what does ae do when my vram fills up?" or, "how does ae use vram?" if ae switches to just processing on the cpu once the vram fills up then getting the 770 with 4gb of vram makes more sense because i'll be able to push through more of the scene without a sudden and drastic slowdown.</s><s> however, if ae loads a single frame or even a handful of frames into vram, does it's calculations, then spits it out to the ram before grabbing the next frame/s then 3gb of vram would be more than sufficient for the work i do and the gtx 780 will be a significantly better choice due to it's increased bandwidth and cuda cores.</s><s> if you know the answer to this question, or if you could direct me to someone who does it would be an enormous help.

</s><s>this, by all means, should never happen.</s><s> while in particular opengl is a "greedy" processing model that will consume resources until they may run out, the combination of a client program's own intelligence, the graphics driver and the cards own safeguards built into the chips and firmware should just not allow it. whenever it happens, these are bugs somewhere in that chain.</s><s> otherwise the program is supposed to simply revert to emulated opengl (if available) or other fallback options or at least exit gracefully, if it can't work without opengl.</s><s> this is even in parts defined in the spec itself.</s><s> cuda and opencl work differently and are more complex processing models that offer more detailed control about gpu and memory usage, but in a sense function similarly - even opencl functions have to be anchored and defined in the hardware driver that manages the whole show. 
</s><s>in turn this means that whenever ae falls back to cpu only modes it does so because one of the aformentioned requirements is not met and the program has the good sense of not forcing the issue and crash.</s><s> the same would be true for element 3d - if it refuses to work then something is afoot and, contrary to your thinking, just using excessive amounts of vram may not at all be the solution to the problem.</s><s> unless you use large textures it wouldn't matter, anyway.</s><s> mere geometry handling is relatively light weight and before you could cram a 20million polygon model into element 3d it would have crashed for other reasons.</s><s> the same would be true for raytrace 3d or other plug-ins like freeform pro: the tesseleation is unlikely to ever reach a complexity that would exhaust all vram, but adding an 8k reflection texture might because it would have to be kept in memory all the time. 
</s><s>conversely all other places where ae uses gpu acceleration would primarily be affected by how large pixel buffers are because that's the real crunch here - ae does not support tiled or multi-res image formats nor similar rendering techniques, so it often needs to keep data around even if only part of it is visible.</s><s> furthermore of course the various options for decoding and encoding certain formats may use gpu functions as do some things like drawing stuff in the 3d tracker interface for instance.

<s>this is all great info guys!</s><s> mylenium, so basically you are saying that while having some vram is important it is unlikely that i would run into the issue that todd mentioned where after effects would have to keep swapping large texture files in and out of the vram because the texture files would have to indeed be very large.</s><s> so if i did frequently work with huge textures and things that need to be stored in vram like the 8k reflection texture you mentioned then it would be more important to have more vram without sacrificing too much bandwidth.</s><s> but to your point, it is indeed unlikely that i'll be using 8k reflections for the type of work i do so the difference between 3gb and 4gb of vram isn't too significant for me... unless i wanted to do transformers level 3d modeling... which would be fun, but i doubt i'll ever work on a project that requires that much detail.</s><s> am i on track with what you're saying? 
</s><s>thanks for the response todd!</s><s> it seems that you are erring on the side of having more vram on setups with multiple monitors (which i have) while also using other applications (which i frequently do).</s><s> granted i'm only using two 23" 1920 x 1080 monitors which i'm sure is significantly less taxing than 27" 4k monitors.</s><s> what if the project is only using relatively basic 3d models with a modest poly count and lower res textures?</s><s> am i correct in assuming that the total vram available becomes less important such that having a higher bandwidth would allow for closer to real-time model manipulation than a card with more vram, but less bandwidth?</s><s> or is hard drive speed the limiting factor there?</s><s> i guess that all depends on how ae handles it's 3d models for ray-traced and element 3d. are the models only stored on the hard drive or are they pulled onto the gpu while you are working on them? 
</s><s>thinking about what get's pulled onto the gpu, here's another question.</s><s> if you run a ram preview does the gpu unload everything into the ram after it finishes its calculations?</s><s> the reason i ask is because if it does unload it to the ram when it finishes it's calculations then i'm assuming that means i'd only need as much vram as a single frame of my scene requires.</s><s> or does the vram store more than just the current frame's worth of information? 
i think the answer to this question would help clear even more up.</s><s> what types of things stay in vram regardless of what frame you are viewing and what types of things are only in vram for that one frame?</s><s> from what i understand it sounds like global effects such as lighting, textures, reflection maps, shadows, and similar effects remain in vram provided you have enough space.</s><s> then the 3d objects that the global effects act on are only stored in vram for the current frame you are looking at.</s><s> then when you scrub through to another frame the software checks to see if the objects in the new frame are currently in vram.</s><s> if they are the gpu runs it's calculations for all of the global effects on the objects and displays the updated image.</s><s> however, if a different object appears in the new frame then it finds the object on your hard drive and, if there is enough room, loads that into the vram as well.</s><s> if there isn't enough room it unloads anything that might not be in the frame anymore to make room for the new object.</s><s> if it can't remove something to fit the new object then i'm assuming the processing for the new object then gets handled by the cpu?</s><s> or maybe it processes the object that is already in vram, moves that object to ram, then pulls the new object in and processes that one? 
</s><s>after all that i suppose the only thing left to determine is how much space is required for effects like 8k reflections, lighting, etc. if it's only 1 to 2gb to store those types of effects then we'd know that someone who uses a given set of effects would need 1 to 2gb plus the collective size of the raw 3d models they are working with.</s><s> all of which can be calculated providing you have enough vram to test individual parameters.</s><s> for example.</s><s> start with an empty project and look at vram usage.</s><s> then add a 3d cube with flat faces and see how much the vram usage goes up.</s><s> that will give a rough estimate of the 3d cube size (in mb).</s><s> now add an effect like an 8k reflection or a light and see how much the vram usage goes up again.</s><s> i'm assuming this will give at least a ballpark idea of how much space different effects take up in vram.</s><s> i'll be running this test myself once i get a new gpu.</s><s> i can't now because i currently only have about 600mb available for ae to use which fills up too quick to accurately measure anything. 
</s><s>sorry for the very technical questions.</s><s> as an electrical engineer it's my job to find the best solution possible without wasting resources or skimping on resources that may benefit a specific design under special circumstances.</s><s> everything can be quantified and broken down into relatively basic math.</s><s> while choosing a gpu is a subjective matter that changes based on a person's uses i do believe that, given enough information, a definitive answer can be found when applying the learned principles to user specific needs.</s><s> i did a study on ram for the exact same reason a while back.</s><s> it took a decent amount of research, but i was able to put together a few equations that would determine which speed vs cas latency would yield the best results for any given hardware.</s><s> while it's obviously unrealistic to break these calculations down all the way to poly count, reflection resolutions and the like i believe that with a bit more technical info a generalized guide can be put together to help anyone determine what the best card is for them personally regardless of whether they are shopping for cards now or a year from now. 
</s><s>rick, thanks for that link.</s><s> i'll definitely be watching that in the near future! 
</s><s>thanks for all the help so far guys!</s><s> it's definitely getting me much closer to the bottom of this!

<s>here's my two cents: 
1.</s><s> disc preview. 
</s><s>this would work as the opposite for ram preview, so that ae would basically render the comp in to a temp folder in order to be able to run the preview in real time.</s><s> this would be useful in situations in which there is not enough memory for a complete ram preview.</s><s> i know about disc cache and have it turned on, but many times ae won't use disc cache since it thinks it's faster to use ram.</s><s> it's frustrating in situations in which you don't get disc cache but you don't get a full ram preview either.</s><s> basically this could work simply as a way to force ae to render something in to disc cache. 
i know i can always render the movie out to preview it like this, but instead of specifying output module settings, file locations and then opening the rendered file in a video player software, it would be so much easier to just hit a keyboard shortcut and let ae take care of everything, similarly to what premiere does when you render the timeline.</s><s> i want to make clear that this shouldn't in any way replace ram preview, but simply be available as an option for those situations in which ram preview doesn't cut it. 

2. timeline folders. 
</s><s>the ability to organize layers in the timeline into folders, in order to make the timeline easier to navigate.</s><s> we have folders in the project window and they are great, why not extend that functionality in to the timeline too?</s><s> i bet that in most projects the timeline has much more items than the project window does, which makes it very important to be able to keep the timeline tidy.</s><s> a timeline folder would simply be a visual way to group layers inside folders.</s><s> this way a 100 layers could be displayed as a single folder layer if necessary.</s><s> vertical screen estate is very valuable in the days of wide screen displays, and this would help make better use of it. 
3.</s><s> spatial snapping. 
</s><s>we have the ability to snap the cti in the timeline and we have the ability to snap layers to the grid.</s><s> i think it would be great if there were an option to snap objects geometrically in to each others too (in the comp window).</s><s> smart guides and snapping similar to adobe illustrator would be fantastic! 
</s><s>thank you and keep developing the greatest software in the world!

<s>i would love to see some development put into optimizing ae for color correction.</s><s> i truly think it's fundamentally good enough to compete with apple color and win, but some interface work has to be done to get it there.</s><s> here are a few things that occurred to me: 
increase the size of the interface element for curves, levels, hue saturation, etc. each of these filters has a custom interface element in the effects controls which exists at a fixed size.</s><s> this can be very frustrating.</s><s> the curves box in particular is far too small, but the hue-saturation one is not a whole lot better. 
</s><s>give the color correction effects access to masks.</s><s> some other effects do this, and it would simplify color-correction worlflow greatly to not have to make multiple copies of a layer, or a number of adjustment layers.</s><s> a simple drop-down menu at the bottom of each of these effects that said something like "limit effect to" and then a menu to select a mask and an "invert mask" checkbox.</s><s> easy, and very helpful. 
</s><s>invent a key command for "match in- and out points to..." in other words: lets say i make an adjustment layer, but i'd like it to have the same in and out points as the layer below it.</s><s> i can frame over to the first frame and hit opt-{ then frame over to the last frame and hit opt-} or use shift drag.</s><s> neither of these methods are fast or reliable.</s><s> may i suggest option-clicking, a paradigm similar to the option-drag "replace layer" feature from the project window to the timeline.</s><s> in other words, if you select the adjustment layer in the timeline and option-click any other layer, it will match its in and out points to that layer. 
</s><s>beef up hue/saturation.</s><s> when you get a chance, check out apple color's "secondaries" tab, specifically the "hue curve" "luma curve" and "sat curve" tabs within it.</s><s> these three are roughly equivalent to the hue & saturation filter within ae, but the combination of curves-style control and much bigger interface elements makes for a more powerful and more efficient tool.</s><s> i wouldn't be at all unhappy if adobe straight-up copied apple's implementation of this for a better hue/saturation filter. 
</s><s>scopes: yes, i know color finesse has them.</s><s> however, cf is quite limiting in that its interface cuts you off from the rest of ae, which can make it unusable for many things (matching, for example).</s><s> vectorscope, multichannel histogram, and waveform monitor would be great.</s><s> i'd love them all in a separate interface tab like, but separate from, the effects controls, all automatically looking at whatever is in the comp window at the moment. 
</s><s>"take a snapshot" & "show last snapshot" on steroids: this might be better suited to a dedicated "color correction" module within ae a la brainstorm, but what i'd like is the ability to store and play back multiple snapshots, do side by side comparisons, adjust the split screen, move the comparisons around.</s><s> in this respect, don't shoot for apple color.</s><s> their implementation is more flexible but more time consuming.</s><s> the trick is that in order to be useful, it has to be flexible and fast.</s><s> i think the best reference in this respect is dedicated color correction systems.</s><s> the best implementation i've seen thus far is on the baselight. 
</s><s>apparently, ae not have a 3-way color-corrector built in?</s><s> cf does, but again, accessing it means essentially leaving much of ae behind.</s><s> i'd love to get those three little wheels in the effects control window.</s><s> cf's "simplified interface" would be a great place to do it, but at the moment, it's all text. 
</s><s>one media-specific one: put the red controls somewhere other than in the "interpret footage" panel where they're removed from everything else.</s><s> personally, i'd love 'em as an effect.</s><s> effects>>color correction>>red raw controls.</s><s> it would have a little drop down menu a-la adobe camera raw which defaults to "as shot" and sets the sliders accordingly. 
</s><s>this last one is more complicated, and again this might be better suited to a dedicated cc module, but i'd love a way to lock the position of footage in the timeline without losing the ability to add or modify filters, masks, etc. during color correction, it is easy to accidentally change the in- and out-points of footage while setting in- and out- points for multiple adjustment layers simultaneously.

<s>here's my two cents: 
1.</s><s> disc preview. 
</s><s>this would work as the opposite for ram preview, so that ae would basically render the comp in to a temp folder in order to be able to run the preview in real time.</s><s> this would be useful in situations in which there is not enough memory for a complete ram preview.</s><s> i know about disc cache and have it turned on, but many times ae won't use disc cache since it thinks it's faster to use ram.</s><s> it's frustrating in situations in which you don't get disc cache but you don't get a full ram preview either.</s><s> basically this could work simply as a way to force ae to render something in to disc cache. 
i know i can always render the movie out to preview it like this, but instead of specifying output module settings, file locations and then opening the rendered file in a video player software, it would be so much easier to just hit a keyboard shortcut and let ae take care of everything, similarly to what premiere does when you render the timeline.</s><s> i want to make clear that this shouldn't in any way replace ram preview, but simply be available as an option for those situations in which ram preview doesn't cut it. 

2. timeline folders. 
</s><s>the ability to organize layers in the timeline into folders, in order to make the timeline easier to navigate.</s><s> we have folders in the project window and they are great, why not extend that functionality in to the timeline too?</s><s> i bet that in most projects the timeline has much more items than the project window does, which makes it very important to be able to keep the timeline tidy.</s><s> a timeline folder would simply be a visual way to group layers inside folders.</s><s> this way a 100 layers could be displayed as a single folder layer if necessary.</s><s> vertical screen estate is very valuable in the days of wide screen displays, and this would help make better use of it. 
3.</s><s> spatial snapping. 
</s><s>we have the ability to snap the cti in the timeline and we have the ability to snap layers to the grid.</s><s> i think it would be great if there were an option to snap objects geometrically in to each others too (in the comp window).</s><s> smart guides and snapping similar to adobe illustrator would be fantastic! 
</s><s>thank you and keep developing the greatest software in the world!

<s>i would love to see some development put into optimizing ae for color correction.</s><s> i truly think it's fundamentally good enough to compete with apple color and win, but some interface work has to be done to get it there.</s><s> here are a few things that occurred to me: 
increase the size of the interface element for curves, levels, hue saturation, etc. each of these filters has a custom interface element in the effects controls which exists at a fixed size.</s><s> this can be very frustrating.</s><s> the curves box in particular is far too small, but the hue-saturation one is not a whole lot better. 
</s><s>give the color correction effects access to masks.</s><s> some other effects do this, and it would simplify color-correction worlflow greatly to not have to make multiple copies of a layer, or a number of adjustment layers.</s><s> a simple drop-down menu at the bottom of each of these effects that said something like "limit effect to" and then a menu to select a mask and an "invert mask" checkbox.</s><s> easy, and very helpful. 
</s><s>invent a key command for "match in- and out points to..." in other words: lets say i make an adjustment layer, but i'd like it to have the same in and out points as the layer below it.</s><s> i can frame over to the first frame and hit opt-{ then frame over to the last frame and hit opt-} or use shift drag.</s><s> neither of these methods are fast or reliable.</s><s> may i suggest option-clicking, a paradigm similar to the option-drag "replace layer" feature from the project window to the timeline.</s><s> in other words, if you select the adjustment layer in the timeline and option-click any other layer, it will match its in and out points to that layer. 
</s><s>beef up hue/saturation.</s><s> when you get a chance, check out apple color's "secondaries" tab, specifically the "hue curve" "luma curve" and "sat curve" tabs within it.</s><s> these three are roughly equivalent to the hue & saturation filter within ae, but the combination of curves-style control and much bigger interface elements makes for a more powerful and more efficient tool.</s><s> i wouldn't be at all unhappy if adobe straight-up copied apple's implementation of this for a better hue/saturation filter. 
</s><s>scopes: yes, i know color finesse has them.</s><s> however, cf is quite limiting in that its interface cuts you off from the rest of ae, which can make it unusable for many things (matching, for example).</s><s> vectorscope, multichannel histogram, and waveform monitor would be great.</s><s> i'd love them all in a separate interface tab like, but separate from, the effects controls, all automatically looking at whatever is in the comp window at the moment. 
</s><s>"take a snapshot" & "show last snapshot" on steroids: this might be better suited to a dedicated "color correction" module within ae a la brainstorm, but what i'd like is the ability to store and play back multiple snapshots, do side by side comparisons, adjust the split screen, move the comparisons around.</s><s> in this respect, don't shoot for apple color.</s><s> their implementation is more flexible but more time consuming.</s><s> the trick is that in order to be useful, it has to be flexible and fast.</s><s> i think the best reference in this respect is dedicated color correction systems.</s><s> the best implementation i've seen thus far is on the baselight. 
</s><s>apparently, ae not have a 3-way color-corrector built in?</s><s> cf does, but again, accessing it means essentially leaving much of ae behind.</s><s> i'd love to get those three little wheels in the effects control window.</s><s> cf's "simplified interface" would be a great place to do it, but at the moment, it's all text. 
</s><s>one media-specific one: put the red controls somewhere other than in the "interpret footage" panel where they're removed from everything else.</s><s> personally, i'd love 'em as an effect.</s><s> effects>>color correction>>red raw controls.</s><s> it would have a little drop down menu a-la adobe camera raw which defaults to "as shot" and sets the sliders accordingly. 
</s><s>this last one is more complicated, and again this might be better suited to a dedicated cc module, but i'd love a way to lock the position of footage in the timeline without losing the ability to add or modify filters, masks, etc. during color correction, it is easy to accidentally change the in- and out-points of footage while setting in- and out- points for multiple adjustment layers simultaneously.
