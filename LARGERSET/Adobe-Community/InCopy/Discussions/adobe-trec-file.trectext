give-away course overviews have (see image below): - course category - course title - course author - course register icons - course points 


</s><s>the register icons are small shapes and these shapes together with the points (ptn) and authors are placed in a table to align them. 


</s><s>i'm now using 1 incopy file for all these products in a not very ideal way. 
</s><s>the way i use incopy is the following: create/update the incopy file with all details update linked files in indesign detach linked files and remove unneeded details for each specific product export 
because the usages of tables step 3 is a lot of work for me. 
</s><s>we want to hand over the updating of the incopy files to our editors, but for our editors the tables and shapes aren't easy to create in incopy. 
</s><s>now i was thinking of linking all paragraphs in separate text-containers and place the unwanted details outside the visible area in indesign, but this is a pain to do aswell. 
i would like to know what other techniques i can use.</s><s> is there a way to specify what paragraph from incopy i want to use in my indesign document?
