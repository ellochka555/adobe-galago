<s>greetings,

<subject>Why does pitch bender not allow me to drag the curve to change pitch?</subject>
<post author="umhum" timestamp="Mar 17, 2014 3:49 PM">
<s>i currently have version 6.0 on the mac.</s><s> i am trying to change the pitch of a generated tone (short in duration, about 300ms).</s><s> however, and this has only been happening recently, when selecting the pitch bender tool, i can no longer drag the curve the change the pitch.</s><s> when i try to double click a specific point on my pitch graph, it simply highlights the entire selection.</s><s> i tried selecting a preset, and even though the pitch curve changes, i am unable to adjust the curve.</s><s> is it something i changed, or is this a bug?</s><s> thank you in advance.

</s></quote>yes, well... all previous comments notwithstanding, let me tell you what actually happens: 
for a start, you can only determine the position of the templates folder, not the default save location for your files, because there isn't one.</s><s> when you create a new multitrack session, you can determine at the moment you create it where it will be saved, simply by hitting the 'browse' button and selecting a location.</s><s> and, audition only has one session templates folder - it doesn't create a new one every time you start a new session.</s><s> the session templates folder contains exactly what it says it does - session template files. 
</s><s>when you start a new multitrack session, you get several choices to make.</s><s> firstly the session name - easy.</s><s> secondly, the location of the folder it is to be saved in - use the browse button to select the location you want.</s><s> thirdly, you can select a template to use from the templates folder if you want.</s><s> if you start another session, you will find that audition has remembered the location of your previous one, and offers that initially - not particularly helpful, but that's the way it goes - hence, there isn't a 'default' option.</s><s> you wouldn't want a default option anyway in most instances - you'd end up with a right old clutter in the folder in no time. 
</s><s>in multitrack, the disk cache folder is irrelevant - multitrack files are written direct to disk, and the cache folder is only used in waveform view.</s><s> this is why, in multitrack view, you have to choose a location to save files first, and in waveform view you are prompted after recording; the file is saved from the cache.

</s></quote>yes, well... all previous comments notwithstanding, let me tell you what actually happens: 
for a start, you can only determine the position of the templates folder, not the default save location for your files, because there isn't one.</s><s> when you create a new multitrack session, you can determine at the moment you create it where it will be saved, simply by hitting the 'browse' button and selecting a location.</s><s> and, audition only has one session templates folder - it doesn't create a new one every time you start a new session.</s><s> the session templates folder contains exactly what it says it does - session template files. 
</s><s>when you start a new multitrack session, you get several choices to make.</s><s> firstly the session name - easy.</s><s> secondly, the location of the folder it is to be saved in - use the browse button to select the location you want.</s><s> thirdly, you can select a template to use from the templates folder if you want.</s><s> if you start another session, you will find that audition has remembered the location of your previous one, and offers that initially - not particularly helpful, but that's the way it goes - hence, there isn't a 'default' option.</s><s> you wouldn't want a default option anyway in most instances - you'd end up with a right old clutter in the folder in no time. 
</s><s>in multitrack, the disk cache folder is irrelevant - multitrack files are written direct to disk, and the cache folder is only used in waveform view.</s><s> this is why, in multitrack view, you have to choose a location to save files first, and in waveform view you are prompted after recording; the file is saved from the cache.

<s>well, a first thing i'd look into is what your podcast carrier is doing to your material. 
</s><s>mp3 compression artifacts are cumulative.</s><s> if i read your work flow correctly, you're downloading some material from the internet so that'll be mp3.</s><s> we can only guess how it was originated...it might have been recorded in mp3, transferred to a computer to editing, then saved again as mp3 so that's two codings and two sets of losses. 
</s><s>if you then download, audition will convert the file to a form of wave for editing (necessary--since mp3 is frame based you can only do the most basic editing native to that format).</s><s> save that to mp3 and that's a third mp3 coding, 
then comes the crunch.</s><s> many host sites for podcasts take your material and re-encode it to an even lower/worse mp3 bit rate.</s><s> that gives a total of 4 mp3 codings...maybe more...with the last one likely at a pretty poor bit rate.</s><s> in my experience, each coding gets gradually worse until you hit a certain point then it's like going over a quality cliff. 
</s><s>if it sound good before you upload it, ask your hosting site what they're doing to your material.
