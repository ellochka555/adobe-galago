<s>hi bosu babu 
</s><s>as stated in the faq, membership is linked to an individual id so if you need more than 1 membership you'd need to use a separate adobe id for each one. 
http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud/faq.html 
can i buy more than one membership to an individual offering of creative cloud? 
no, adobe has moved to identity-based licensing with a technology that will not support multiple same-product licenses, so you can buy only one membership per adobe id.</s><s> if you need two creative cloud memberships, you will need to purchase each with a unique adobe id.</s><s> you can also purchase a creative cloud for teams membership, which allows you to purchase and manage multiple seats under one account.

<s>file sync is something you can already do with dropbox, google drive, microsoft skydrive (now onedrive), sugar sync, ... and on and on. 
</s><s>it's not clear that there is any added value at all to adobe's "file sync"... but it is very irritating to pay for a year of subscription for advertised services that don't get rolled out even after 9 months (typekit took 4 months from "coming soon teaser" to availability).

<s>hi romit, thanks for answering, but i think you may of misunderstood the question.</s><s> i understand you can have 2 installed versions of the one account.</s><s> but i am going into different companies who have there own creative cloud account and installed their own version of cc. 
</s><s>my question was, is it possible to sync my settings that i use for cc on a machine which isnt owned by me.</s><s> i dont want to download any apps etc just use the settings saved.

http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud/faq.html# 
-- do i need ongoing internet access to use my creative cloud desktop applications? 
no. your creative cloud desktop applications (such as photoshop and illustrator) are installed directly on your computer, so you won't need an ongoing internet connection to use them on a daily basis. 
</s><s>you will need to be online when you install and license your software.</s><s> if you have an annual membership, you'll be asked to connect to the web to validate your software licenses every 30 days.</s><s> however, you'll be able to use products for 99 days even if you're offline. -- 
(note, we are planning to expand this to 180 days.</s><s>) 
</s><s>so, you have to be online when you install, but after that, you only need to be online once every 3 months (99 days). 
</s><s>hope that helps...

<s>in fact, to add to my previous post, most people's objections i have seen were because of their mistaken assumption that the creative cloud involved having to be constantly connected to the internet.</s><s> and many people believe the apps are actually hosted in the cloud!</s><s> none of that is true.</s><s> we've been very happy so far with creative cloud because with cc we've seen much faster release updates with new and better features and bug fixes than in the past and this has allowed us to create better results for our clients faster.</s><s> we've increased our profitability, the fixes and updates make the tools more enjoyable to use, our clients are happier, and adobe can just concentrate on making great products and improving them regularly rather than making some big splashy marketing push every two years just to make it seem worth upgrading.... with no ongoing feedback they get with the frequent cc releases.</s><s> and of course this means they get to see more regular income rather than big swings up and down depending on if its a release month/year or not and all the uncertainty involved in that type of release schedule.</s><s> sounds like a win-win-win situation to me. 
</s><s>as for the pricing, its cheaper than the master collection was (unless you don't update for about 4 years) plus provides access to more apps and features than the mc ever did.</s><s> but if you're still using 4 year old software in the web industry in particular, i really feel sorry for you and your clients.</s><s> it's like the companies that force their employees to use ie6 in 2013. 
</s><s>basically, the web and basically all things digital arew advancing far too fast for adobe to stick to the old slow method of updating software every 2 years.</s><s> by that time, whatever they had been working on over the 2 years could already be obsolete when it is released. 
</s><s>one of my favorite things about modern software and agile development is how fast updates and bug fixes come.</s><s> i open the app store on my iphone and there are always a bunch of apps waiting to be updated often with cool new features and bug fixes.</s><s> adobe themselves realized they needed to either get with the times or be left behind.</s><s> and incidentally, the same applies to you and your business as well. 
</s><s>and this might sound harsh but if you aren't making enough money to be able to afford $49 a month for all the tools you need to do pretty much any kind of creative work a client may ask for, it might be time for you to change to another line of work.</s><s> heck, the guy who does yard work in my neighborhood spends more than that a month on his tools. :-)

http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud/faq.html# 
-- do i need ongoing internet access to use my creative cloud desktop applications? 
no. your creative cloud desktop applications (such as photoshop and illustrator) are installed directly on your computer, so you won't need an ongoing internet connection to use them on a daily basis. 
</s><s>you will need to be online when you install and license your software.</s><s> if you have an annual membership, you'll be asked to connect to the web to validate your software licenses every 30 days.</s><s> however, you'll be able to use products for 99 days even if you're offline. -- 
(note, we are planning to expand this to 180 days.</s><s>) 
</s><s>so, you have to be online when you install, but after that, you only need to be online once every 3 months (99 days). 
</s><s>hope that helps...

<s>in fact, to add to my previous post, most people's objections i have seen were because of their mistaken assumption that the creative cloud involved having to be constantly connected to the internet.</s><s> and many people believe the apps are actually hosted in the cloud!</s><s> none of that is true.</s><s> we've been very happy so far with creative cloud because with cc we've seen much faster release updates with new and better features and bug fixes than in the past and this has allowed us to create better results for our clients faster.</s><s> we've increased our profitability, the fixes and updates make the tools more enjoyable to use, our clients are happier, and adobe can just concentrate on making great products and improving them regularly rather than making some big splashy marketing push every two years just to make it seem worth upgrading.... with no ongoing feedback they get with the frequent cc releases.</s><s> and of course this means they get to see more regular income rather than big swings up and down depending on if its a release month/year or not and all the uncertainty involved in that type of release schedule.</s><s> sounds like a win-win-win situation to me. 
</s><s>as for the pricing, its cheaper than the master collection was (unless you don't update for about 4 years) plus provides access to more apps and features than the mc ever did.</s><s> but if you're still using 4 year old software in the web industry in particular, i really feel sorry for you and your clients.</s><s> it's like the companies that force their employees to use ie6 in 2013.

<s>first let me say that my earlier instructions for removing aam were only partially correct.</s><s> those instructions remove just the creative cloud part of aam and should really only be used if you are having trouble running aam with your creative cloud subscription. 
</s><s>if you are using most adobe products then aam is installed and is required for the product to run correctly.</s><s> aam is used for creative cloud, and is also used for perpetual licensing (when you enter a serial number).</s><s> aam also handles updating your installed products. 
</s><s>so yes aam is installed with photoshop elements and premierepro elements. 
</s><s>for customers who try a mix of perpetual license (for example using a serial number with the master collection or just photoshop) and then try a creative cloud trial or paid subscription you might see aam telling you that a product is not installed when it is.</s><s> this is a known issue.
