<post author="Milky_au" timestamp="Mar 12, 2014 5:40 AM">
<s>hello mozzarrella, 
</s><s>converting a director made projector (.exe) cd-rom into a shockwave player (.dcr) version, that plays straight off the web, can be a very tricky. 
</s><s>remember that many cd-rom projects are large - right up to 700 mb. 
</s><s>if you just publish your .</s><s>dir file as a .drc file, then place it online, you will most likely hit speed / download issues. 
</s><s>the first mistake i see when people try to make shockwave stuff - is working with external files / linked files. 
</s><s>if you are linking with external files from your hosted online "dswmedia folder" - then you will have to preload them first... 
if you don't preload (or stream) your files, then your program will just wait around, while it's trying to download the external member.</s><s> (or if will give up and do nothing - or it will give you some strange error like 'could not composite the bit map?') 
</s><s>what length, and screen size are the videos? 
</s><s>if they are small, then preloading them would view best - but if they are larger in size, more then a few mb, you'll need to stream them. 
i can't really help without having a little more to work with. 
</s><s>private message me for more help. 
regards milky

<s>hi clangton yes that's what i thought too!</s><s> how are you going with your 'gotonetmovie' - have you made any progress? 
i would really like to be able to use 'gotonetmovie "name.dcr" and use relative links so that i dont have to rewrite all the links when the project is uploaded to another server - but will try to make my vidoes work inside director movies and see if that make a difference. 
i made a test.</s><s> i made 2 movies - movie1 and movie 2. they each had only one text 'this is movie one' and one button 'gotonetmovie "movie2.dcr' and viceversa this kind of worked when i uploaded to server.</s><s> the links worked about 8 time only before it stopped working.</s><s> consistently about 8 times!</s><s> so not sure what is going on.

<s>yes to the qt-mp4 files playing on windows without qt installed - (i hate qt by the way!</s><s>) they are seeing the mp4 codec and playing them with vlc

<s>hello mozzarrella, 
</s><s>converting a director made projector (.exe) cd-rom into a shockwave player (.dcr) version, that plays straight off the web, can be a very tricky. 
</s><s>remember that many cd-rom projects are large - right up to 700 mb. 
</s><s>if you just publish your .</s><s>dir file as a .drc file, then place it online, you will most likely hit speed / download issues. 
</s><s>the first mistake i see when people try to make shockwave stuff - is working with external files / linked files. 
</s><s>if you are linking with external files from your hosted online "dswmedia folder" - then you will have to preload them first... 
if you don't preload (or stream) your files, then your program will just wait around, while it's trying to download the external member.</s><s> (or if will give up and do nothing - or it will give you some strange error like 'could not composite the bit map?') 
</s><s>what length, and screen size are the videos? 
</s><s>if they are small, then preloading them would view best - but if they are larger in size, more then a few mb, you'll need to stream them. 
i can't really help without having a little more to work with. 
</s><s>private message me for more help.

<s>hi clangton yes that's what i thought too!</s><s> how are you going with your 'gotonetmovie' - have you made any progress? 
i would really like to be able to use 'gotonetmovie "name.dcr" and use relative links so that i dont have to rewrite all the links when the project is uploaded to another server - but will try to make my vidoes work inside director movies and see if that make a difference. 
i made a test.</s><s> i made 2 movies - movie1 and movie 2. they each had only one text 'this is movie one' and one button 'gotonetmovie "movie2.dcr' and viceversa this kind of worked when i uploaded to server.</s><s> the links worked about 8 time only before it stopped working.</s><s> consistently about 8 times!</s><s> so not sure what is going on.

<s>yes to the qt-mp4 files playing on windows without qt installed - (i hate qt by the way!</s><s>) they are seeing the mp4 codec and playing them with vlc

</s><s>both 'blank_video' & 'blank_video_backup' - are what i call placeholder cast members... they don't really link to anything - they just tell director where you wish to have the video placed on the screen - and also the type of video you wish to play. 
before the director playhead gets to them, you swap them for the newly pre-downloaded video's, off your hosted web site.

<s>hi daniel, 
</s><s>i used flash cs3 pro steps involved were: 
create new as2 document set document width, height and frame rate appropriate to the video file you are converting select file>import>import to stage select your video file from the os file dialog in the import video wizard click next select embed video in swf and play in the timeline click next 
in the embedding step symbol type as embedded video audio track as integrated left checked place instance on stage expand timeline if needed embed the entire video (up to you really) click next 
in the encoding stage i ignored the profile tab and clicked on video tab on the video codec select sorenson spark from the dropdown the rest of the setting here are dependant on your video requirements on the audio tab i selected 160 kbs as my desired bitrate crop and resize are again dependant on what you want from your file click next click finish 
when the encode is finished i published my swf as flash player 8 (not sure if this matters much) 
</s><s>in director i then simply import the swf (standard import), placed as a single span sprite on the score and added a go to the frame script in the frame script channel, then published to test on ios

<s>hi been testing getting some video from an old project (quicktimes - animation codec) to play on ios as flash swfs. this forum has been very helpful and i have finally got it working. 
</s><s>my most important finding is that you have to use the sorenson sparc codec - on2 codec causes my apps to crash instantly. 
</s><s>funnily in d12 on my mac the sparc compressed videos show as a blank screen but i can hear the audio. 
i did not have to stretch the flash video sprite on the director score - worked fine as a single cell with a (go to the frame ) frame script 
also counterintuitive was that playback performance was better with dts disabled

<s>hi daniel, 
</s><s>i used flash cs3 pro steps involved were: 
create new as2 document set document width, height and frame rate appropriate to the video file you are converting select file>import>import to stage select your video file from the os file dialog in the import video wizard click next select embed video in swf and play in the timeline click next 
in the embedding step symbol type as embedded video audio track as integrated left checked place instance on stage expand timeline if needed embed the entire video (up to you really) click next 
in the encoding stage i ignored the profile tab and clicked on video tab on the video codec select sorenson spark from the dropdown the rest of the setting here are dependant on your video requirements on the audio tab i selected 160 kbs as my desired bitrate crop and resize are again dependant on what you want from your file click next click finish 
when the encode is finished i published my swf as flash player 8 (not sure if this matters much) 
</s><s>in director i then simply import the swf (standard import), placed as a single span sprite on the score and added a go to the frame script in the frame script channel, then published to test on ios 
hope this helps

<s>not good.</s><s> i just used the generic options "iphone developer" when setting up in the iso dev portal. 

i copied this out of the developer tech notes - it may help? 
http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#technotes/tn2250/_index.html#/ /apple_ref/doc/uid/dts40009933 how do i resolve the codesign error: provisioning profile can't be found?</s><s> an example of this error is: # code sign error: provisioning profile can't be found this means that the provisioning profile assigned to either your "debug" or "release" code signing identity setting cannot be found in your provisioning profile library.</s><s> this could happen if you open a project on a different machine, because provisioning profiles are tied to the mac os x user and are not bundled with the xcode project!</s><s> this error only surfaces when you have made an *explicit* profile selection from the code signing identity profile pop-up selection menu instead of allowing xcode to choose the right profile for you by using either of the generic options "iphone developer" or "iphone distribution" under the "automatic profile selector" section of the profile pop-up.</s><s> to correct this error: 1) restore the missing provisioning profile into your profile library by downloading it from the ios portal, and dragging it onto the xcode icon on your dock.</s><s> 2) update the 'dead profile link' by performing the steps in section assigning provisioning profiles to build configurations to assign a profile that does exist in your library.</s><s> 3) if xcode appears to be deleting your provisioning profiles from your profile library in error, turn off provisioning profile refresh, then perform step 1) again to restore the missing profile. 

if all else fails you could try...</s><s> go to xcode5 -> window -> organizer -> devices select your device select provisioning profiles delete all profiles close down xcode open xcode -> window -> organizer -> devices > select your device > select provisioning profiles add back your profile again re-build your .ipa file again with director 12 - (making sure it's set to your provisioning profile) copy it across to your ipad with xcode - and see if it works.

<s>not good.</s><s> i just used the generic options "iphone developer" when setting up in the iso dev portal. 

i copied this out of the developer tech notes - it may help? 
http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#technotes/tn2250/_index.html#/ /apple_ref/doc/uid/dts40009933 how do i resolve the codesign error: provisioning profile can't be found?</s><s> an example of this error is: # code sign error: provisioning profile can't be found this means that the provisioning profile assigned to either your "debug" or "release" code signing identity setting cannot be found in your provisioning profile library.</s><s> this could happen if you open a project on a different machine, because provisioning profiles are tied to the mac os x user and are not bundled with the xcode project!</s><s> this error only surfaces when you have made an *explicit* profile selection from the code signing identity profile pop-up selection menu instead of allowing xcode to choose the right profile for you by using either of the generic options "iphone developer" or "iphone distribution" under the "automatic profile selector" section of the profile pop-up.</s><s> to correct this error: 1) restore the missing provisioning profile into your profile library by downloading it from the ios portal, and dragging it onto the xcode icon on your dock.</s><s> 2) update the 'dead profile link' by performing the steps in section assigning provisioning profiles to build configurations to assign a profile that does exist in your library.</s><s> 3) if xcode appears to be deleting your provisioning profiles from your profile library in error, turn off provisioning profile refresh, then perform step 1) again to restore the missing profile. 

if all else fails you could try...</s><s> go to xcode5 -> window -> organizer -> devices select your device select provisioning profiles delete all profiles close down xcode open xcode -> window -> organizer -> devices > select your device > select provisioning profiles add back your profile again re-build your .ipa file again with director 12 - (making sure it's set to your provisioning profile) copy it across to your ipad with xcode - and see if it works.

<s>you have to include in the package a splash screen named default-568h@2x.png ,without that it's not iphone 5 compliant, and will get rejected.
