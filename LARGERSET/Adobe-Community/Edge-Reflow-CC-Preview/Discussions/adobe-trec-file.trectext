<s>yeah, the grid in reflow is really just a visual and snap aid, it doesn't have any implications except for the min/max width in relation to the breakpoints.</s><s> we use a lot of full width background images which don't really snap to the area outside the grid unless they're set to body, but want full page or at least much wider than half a gutter (via show outer gutter) content images and bgs. 
</s><s>so it really depends on the min col grid you need and the hard 16 col limit is an issue for a grid that that has a higher common multiple for it's column variations.</s><s> i.e.</s><s> a 5 and 3 column design would need 15 for the content and 2 for the outside margin but that's over the limit.

</s><s>for that reason, and because of the platform on which we build most projects (nationbuilder) requiring a sidebar, we've gone heavily to 3,2,1 col layouts which we can break into just six layout cols.

the simplest fix though is probably a lifting of the arbitrary limit on number of columns.</s><s> i saw on another thread the devs were willing to consider that, they just needed a solid usecase to do so.</s><s> a grid that accounts for a design with both 4 and 5 columns in it would require at least 20 cols, and 2 extra on the outside would probably be pretty useful so a 24 col max should allow for almost all contingencies-

<subject>Default margins in project generated from PSD causing weird behaviour - is it Reflow or is it me?</subject>
<post author="rickibarnes" timestamp="Mar 17, 2014 1:45 AM">
<s>hi guys, 
i've just downloaded the trial of photoshop cc and edge reflow because i've seen the demos with the fake outdoorsy company and they are really impressive. 
</s><s>unfortunately my first attempt at using reflow for rapid laying out of breakpoint designs has so far been a failure.</s><s> i've created a psd of the layout and then generated the reflow project; so far so good.</s><s> however the default generated layout in reflow includes negative margins that causes crazyballs behaviour when i change the size of the stage (stage?</s><s> don't know correct term but i hope you all know what i mean).</s><s> see screenshot for reference: 
http://www.lateralaspect.com.au/ricki/images/general/reflow-01.jpg 
</s><s>now i just assumed it was my inability to lay out the psd in a correct manner, so i downloaded the bracketsio sample psd.</s><s> note here, i did not download the sample reflow project - just the psd.</s><s> and when i generate a project from that psd, same thing happens:

</s><s>so what i'm wondering is - is this normal behaviour?</s><s> does it indicate something wrong with my install?</s><s> is there something i should be doing in ps to prep the psd more for reflow project generation?</s><s> any feedback would be appreciated!

<s>i would think one feature that could help with dreamweaver is the ability to match css tags in reflow to the tags in dreamweaver, much like indesign matches xml tags to styles.</s><s> i am thinking this would allow a designer to develop a feature in reflow, then be able to at least identify the equivalent item in dw to copy the code/attributes over. 
</s><s>for example in reflow, the container id is easy to find, but it is not so easy to identify it in the initial responsive site code that dreamweaver generates. 
</s><s>thanks for considering!

<s>drjuan,Ê a few more questions because this problem has stumped us and we are trying to figure out any code in reflow that might delete styles.Ê did you do any of the following:Ê 1.</s><s> use the "photoshop sync" toggle in the photoshop reflow panel.</s><s> it is turned off by default, so, you would need to explicitly turn it on.</s><s> 2. duplicate pages 3. use a typekit font 4. rename a page 5. delete any assets via the asset library or by going into your assets folderÊ thanks, again.</s><s> joan

<s>i probably did all those things except use a typekit font.</s><s> but i'm working on a new project today, and it's doing the same thing.</s><s> i didn't use photoshop sync on this one, or duplicate or rename pages.</s><s> the file that's giving me trouble today is designed, but if i close it and reopen later to work on further, the page is completely blank, even the text is gone.</s><s> if i close and reopen, it comes back, but only after 4 or 5 times.</s><s> twice, i had the file open, and there was no css or text, but without closing the file, i double clicked on the reflow file icon in bridge (while the file was already open...</s><s>), and the design returned to the stage.</s><s> this does not work, however, on the file i sent you.</s><s> that design just won't come back.

<s>huge thanks to drjuan for showing us how the problem occurs for him.

we've identified the culprit to be a bug that occurs when opening rflw files from finder or adobe bridge by double clicking on them.

<s>thanks for taking time to read my post, chris!</s><s> the ability to export production code in the next release sounds awesome as i really need to start using reflow already. 
i played around some more from a design exported from photoshop and i do see one more feature that would help: the need to perform the nesting and grouping from within photoshop so that the dom is predictable once it gets to reflow.</s><s> that way really complicated designs from ps won't take ages to reconfigure in the reflow dom.</s><s> i kept losing my ability to get the elements lined up and nested correctly and so i kept starting over.</s><s> it had a about 8 layers so it wasn't easy selecting things and making one a parent of the other without visually "muting" all of the other layers first. 
</s><s>perhaps anything in a group would automatically group those layers in reflow or create a parent for those layers using a switch of some sort (maybe a naming convention or a layer color for group and a layer color for parent). 
</s><s>also, the ability to designate any layer in the ps comp as a parent layer so that all layers above it up to the end of the current group can be nested within it and have a higher z-index at the same time would be great. 
</s><s>so given 10 layers in a group with layer 1 being the bottom most layer, let's say, we could designate layer 1, 4 and 7 as parent layers, but layer 7 is a group (group2) with three layers beneath it. 
</s><s>for example: 
</s><s>in photoshop the layers look like this: 
group1 -layer10 -layer9 -layer8 -group2 --nested layer1 --nested layer2 --nested layer3 -layer6 -layer5 -layer4 -layer3 -layer2 -layer1 <-- lowest z-index 
this could translate into a dom like so: 
group1 -> layer 1 (parent) <-- lowest z-index --> layer 2 --> layer 3 -> layer 4 (parent) --> child layer 5 --> child layer 6 -->layer 7 (group 2) (parent) <-- because it's a group set as a parent, it remains nested within layer 4 rather than on the same level ---> nested layer 1 ---> nested layer 2 ---> nested layer 3 --> layer 8 --> layer 9 --> layer 10 
...or something to that affect, but the ability to nest and group ahead of the export to reflow would make life easier.

<s>"finish the code" means what you get from reflow will likely need more work before you go live.</s><s> the code we are generating is just to show you what can be done on the web, but we aren't going to give you everything you need to wire up the actual form submission, or all the interactivity you might want, or even code qualities like seo, accessibility, and other things that might be relevant to you project.</s><s> we are planning to at least give you all the browser prefixes in a future release so your code will preview better in more browsers. 
</s><s>if you are using dreamweaver and are mostly happy with it then you can feel good staying with it.</s><s> you can take the code from reflow into dreamweaver but you will need to shape it to what you want based on your project.</s><s> the project seven extensions are also really good and if there are just a few things you need to be truly awesome you can ask that team to implement them.</s><s> they're a great team and repsonsive to their users requests.

<s>"finish the code" means what you get from reflow will likely need more work before you go live.</s><s> the code we are generating is just to show you what can be done on the web, but we aren't going to give you everything you need to wire up the actual form submission, or all the interactivity you might want, or even code qualities like seo, accessibility, and other things that might be relevant to you project.</s><s> we are planning to at least give you all the browser prefixes in a future release so your code will preview better in more browsers. 
</s><s>if you are using dreamweaver and are mostly happy with it then you can feel good staying with it.</s><s> you can take the code from reflow into dreamweaver but you will need to shape it to what you want based on your project.</s><s> the project seven extensions are also really good and if there are just a few things you need to be truly awesome you can ask that team to implement them.</s><s> they're a great team and repsonsive to their users requests. 
</s><s>muse will allow you to design for multiple screen sizes but they use server side code to server different desgins to different devices.</s><s> normally that's not a good idea, but with so many people using muse & bc and relying on that server detection you can safe knowing the right code will make it to the right device.</s><s> if you want to design and publish to the web muse it also a vaild option. 
</s><s>hope the helps.</s><s> thanks for checking out reflow.</s><s> you should always pick the tool the works the best for you, makes you feel the most comfortable, creative and productive.

<s>hi there, Ê unfortunately it seems you've run into a situation where edge inspect and typekit don't integrate very well.</s><s> i'll explain a bit more, then offer some suggestions to work around the issue. Ê when you're browsing a local website via the hostname 'localhost', which would not be accessible to any other devices on your network, edge inspect automatically gets your machine's local ip address (which is not the same as the external ip as shown on sites like whatismyip.com) and sends that to the mobile apps.</s><s> for instance, let's say i have a sinatra application running in chrome on my mac as http://localhost:4567.</s><s> my iphone wouldn't be able to understand the hostname "localhost", but it can see my mac using its ip address 10.1.10.1, so edge inspect will navigate to http://10.1.10.1:4567. Ê so, to get fonts working, you could add both 'localhost' and '10.1.10.1' to your kit.</s><s> however, we don't recommend adding local ips to kits because they tend to change without warning.</s><s> (in my example above, the next time i turn on my computer its ip could have changed to 10.1.10.2, but all i would know is that fonts had stopped working on my devices again.</s><s>) Ê the edge web fonts don't check the domain name, which is why that test worked in all your devices. Ê to work around this, we recommend using some form of "dynamic dns" - basically, a domain name that is automatically updated with your current ip and therefore will always point to your computer. Ê if you're using a mac, the simplest thing would be to use your mac's bonjour hostname.</s><s> bonjour is a technology built into mac os x and ios to help devices find each other automatically over networks. Ê to find your bonjour hostname: 1.</s><s> open system preferences on your mac.</s><s> 2. choose the sharing icon.</s><s> 3. your bonjour hostname will be displayed in the top area, under the "computer name" field. Ê you can add the hostname that appears there to your kit, and use it on any apple device on your network.</s><s> for example, my bonjour name is my-mbp.local, so i can browse to http://my-mbp.local:4567 on any mac or ios device and see my sinatra app. Ê unfortunately, this simple solution will only work on apple devices or windows pcs with apple's bonjour software installed - you can't use this hostname with android phones or tablets.</s><s> if you need a hostname that will work on any device, there are a couple of options i'd recommend: Ê 1.</s><s> a third-party service called forward offers a way to easily forward ports from your computer to other devices anywhere on the internet.</s><s> you can learn more about them and sign up for a 30-day trial here: https://forwardhq.com.</s><s> forward will give you a permanent domain name for your forwarded app that you can add to your kit, such as 'dev-yourcompany.fwd.wf'. Ê 2.</s><s> 37signals has a free "wildcard dns" service called xip.io that will automatically forward traffic to a local ip address.</s><s> you can get your current local ip address by opening system preferences, then choosing network.</s><s> the ip address should be shown in the small text underneath the connection status for whatever connection is active (i.e. has a green dot next to it).</s><s> once you have the ip, you can access your computer at [your ip].xip.io.</s><s> to get fonts working, add *.xip.io to your kit.</s><s> remember that your ip may change, so if your site stops being accessible you should check to make sure you have the correct ip address. Ê i personally use xip.io if i need to test typekit on multiple devices using edge inspect.</s><s> it's certainly not the easiest option to use, but it works quite well with almost no setup and it's free. Ê we're going to work to make the experience using typekit and edge inspect together better in the future, but hopefully these suggestions will help you out for now.

<s>i've been using edge reflow for some projects now, so far only for design, to hand the results over to web developers.</s><s> at the moment i'm starting a new project where i'll be taking care of the development myself.</s><s> i'm excited about the product, but here are some things i'm running into that i'm not to happy about: i'd like a swatches panel for colors, not just a block with tiny squares of my last used colors.</s><s> how about a style swatches panel while we're at it?</s><s> like in photoshop, click on such a swatch to apply borders, shadows, gradients, etc. display: inline.</s><s> i've searched the forums, couldn't find a single mention of this incredible gap.</s><s> only display: block or display: none?</s><s> aaargh.</s><s> everything must have it's float set to left or right?</s><s> can't i have a (text) box that just doesn't have its float set?</s><s> for example: i'd like to use float for what it's meant for; float an image to the right, so the text in a paragraph flows around it.</s><s> can't be done, because a) a text block can't contain an image (perfectly possible in html, not in reflow) and b) the paragraph has its float set.</s><s> minor annoyance: default left margin is always set to 0% while the rest is set to 0px.</s><s> why not all px?</s><s> or %?</s><s> please don't decide for me what fonts i can use.</s><s> i'm using google and font-squirrel fonts, i have an icon font with a perfect web license i'd like to use, maybe one day i'll want to create my own icon font.</s><s> you don't allow me to do that (unless typekit or edge web fonts happens to have the same font google has, yay!</s><s>) and it makes me right mad.</s><s> don't patronize your users, please!</s><s> paragraph styles.</s><s> i know, it took ages for those to be integrated into photoshop, probably because you felt it wasn't meant for text.</s><s> well, the web is all about text, so can we have them in reflow?</s><s> please?</s><s> undockable panels, so i can move them to my secundary monitor.</s><s> don't touch settings on other elements when i create a new one.</s><s> i've seen this request on the forum a couple of times now.</s><s> you carefully set margins, padding and then you create a text box in one of those elements and boom!</s><s> margin-top set to -64.6232% on its container.</s><s> what?</s><s> allow me to delete background images (including gradients) at break points.</s><s> when i go to a smaller breakpoint and find that a certain element should not have a bg image anymore, i try to delete it, it looks like i succeeded (the 'layer' in the backgrounds panel is indeed deleted), but the image still shows.</s><s> and sure, when i switch to another break point and back again, lo and behold, there's the background image again.</s><s> this is more of a general question, but how much are you prepared for the new and improved layout techniques with css3?</s><s> flexbox and grid in particular.</s><s> i know they're not well supported yet (grid only works in ie10 at the moment), but is this something you are considering?</s><s> currently when you turn an element into position: absolute, you can't set margins on it anymore.</s><s> why not?</s><s> i want to position elements in the perfect center, by setting top: 50%; left: 50%; and then setting negative margins at half the width / height of the positioned element.</s><s> can't be done. 
</s><s>right, back to some more edge reflow work.</s><s> i'll keep you posted if i come across any more wishes and/or annoyances. 
</s><s>just in case i came across a little aggressive; i'm not.</s><s> i'm happy with this tool, it's currently the best tool i know to show clients how things will flow and work on different devices.</s><s> thanks for this!

<s>some other points: a link to 'recent files' would be nice in the file menu support for the 'rem' unit size not something that i'd use very often, but since it's possible: image borders when dragging the little pointer to change the break point width, it would be nice if pressing shift would snap it to say 10px increments how about double clicking the colored break point bar at the top would open the options (like label and width) for that break point?</s><s> right now you have to press a tiny little arrow in the top right, that's very easy to miss.</s><s> almost every time i try to click it, i click on the + instead and end up adding another break point when you happen to be moving your mouse (even just a bit) as you're selecting an element on the page, you might move it out of position.</s><s> how about the first click on an element only selects it?</s><s> you could be dragging all you want, all you do is select the element(s).</s><s> after it's been selected, then you can click and drag to move it's position.</s><s> i've seen myself at work, i almost never drag an element into position willingly, i let the document flow take care of it and do the nudging by changing margins or padding.

<s>about ems vs rems.</s><s> i've tried to use ems in the past, because everyone was talking about them, but very quickly realised they were a huge pain.</s><s> not only do they cause major headaches when you're trying to do the math (this value is relative to that value is relative to yet another value...</s><s>), they're also severely limiting the re-usability of your modules.</s><s> a module looks great in this context, but when used inside another element that has a larger font-size, it completely changes looks.</s><s> i believe css and the html it's written for should be as loosely coupled as can be, but when using ems you have to know what element goes where and god forbid you use it anywhere else.

</s><s>right, back to some more edge reflow work.</s><s> i'll keep you posted if i come across any more wishes and/or annoyances.

<s>some other points: a link to 'recent files' would be nice in the file menu support for the 'rem' unit size not something that i'd use very often, but since it's possible: image borders when dragging the little pointer to change the break point width, it would be nice if pressing shift would snap it to say 10px increments how about double clicking the colored break point bar at the top would open the options (like label and width) for that break point?</s><s> right now you have to press a tiny little arrow in the top right, that's very easy to miss.</s><s> almost every time i try to click it, i click on the + instead and end up adding another break point when you happen to be moving your mouse (even just a bit) as you're selecting an element on the page, you might move it out of position.</s><s> how about the first click on an element only selects it?</s><s> you could be dragging all you want, all you do is select the element(s).</s><s> after it's been selected, then you can click and drag to move it's position.</s><s> i've seen myself at work, i almost never drag an element into position willingly, i let the document flow take care of it and do the nudging by changing margins or padding.

<s>it's not impemented yet.</s><s> you can export the linked object layer as an image (just add a .png to the layer name), but you can't have the linked object and get it translated to html from the parent psd.</s><s> you could export as an image for now and open the linked object directly and get the html from that and just merge the two when your design is finished.</s><s> i need to talk to the photoshop team and see what we need to do in reflow to get the information of the linked do that for you.</s><s> hopefully it's not too much and we can have it working in the next release.

<s>if that's the case then keep the main grid container at 100% and then just add two boxes inside it.</s><s> the outer one also stretch to 100% and have the inner one stop on column on either side and set the max-width on that.</s><s> you could also just have the inner one strech to 100% with a max-width and have the underneath one show on the side only when it get really wide.</s><s> i know it feels a little akward to use the grid like that, but we only have one container that the grid is on right now so this is what we can do.</s><s> here's an example using yellow for the outer container and red for the inner.

<s>ok - so i use edge animate to create the animations for site, publish that and then place the published artifact in muse.

<s>i am not sure about what you mean with regards to layering.</s><s> reflow allows you to draw boxes, text and add images.</s><s> any of these elements can be placed as children of other boxes.</s><s> so, you can draw box1, box2 and box3 and make box2 and box3 children of box1 by dragging box2 and box3 inside of box1. 
</s><s>if you would like boxes to overlap, you will need to change the box's "position" property (found in the layout tab, advanced panel) to be absolute.</s><s> then, you can have boxes overlap.</s><s> once these boxes are absolute positioned, you can also edit their z-index to show which one should be layered on top of the other. 
</s><s>if layering means you want to move things around in your dom order, yes, we did not support that in the build that is on the creative cloud.</s><s> our next update will allow dom reordering through the elements panel which you can see by clicking on the left-most icon in the status bar. 
</s><s>it sounds to me like you did not see the "save" option enabled when you first tried to save.</s><s> you only saw "save as", is that correct?</s><s> if so, what platform are you on, mac or win?

<s>i am not sure about what you mean with regards to layering.</s><s> reflow allows you to draw boxes, text and add images.</s><s> any of these elements can be placed as children of other boxes.</s><s> so, you can draw box1, box2 and box3 and make box2 and box3 children of box1 by dragging box2 and box3 inside of box1. 
</s><s>if you would like boxes to overlap, you will need to change the box's "position" property (found in the layout tab, advanced panel) to be absolute.</s><s> then, you can have boxes overlap.</s><s> once these boxes are absolute positioned, you can also edit their z-index to show which one should be layered on top of the other. 
</s><s>if layering means you want to move things around in your dom order, yes, we did not support that in the build that is on the creative cloud.</s><s> our next update will allow dom reordering through the elements panel which you can see by clicking on the left-most icon in the status bar. 
</s><s>it sounds to me like you did not see the "save" option enabled when you first tried to save.</s><s> you only saw "save as", is that correct?</s><s> if so, what platform are you on, mac or win?

<post author="tripdragon_uh_2" timestamp="Feb 10, 2014 7:09 PM">
<s>this is in reguards to the previous weeks #reflowchat chat thread of twitter.</s><s> its also a summary to the great deal of research i have done in teh past looking for a decent webdesign and code tool.</s><s> i'm no super pro, i get by, i work, i tinker with many code projects(javascript, source, cocoa, processing ...</s><s> ) but ultimatly have to get back to normal bills work.</s><s> so i always wanted some tool that worked with design but produced proper code. 
i have two examples below. the first a long form video of me trying to use the app.</s><s> the second is a real html example of live code editing.</s><s> i am using a macbook air 10.5" small i know but i love it and it gets the job done. 

</s><s>video: http://artdesignfilmmarketingmedia.com/reflow/reflow-workflow.mov 
what you see here is a realtime use of reflow.</s><s> i am trying nothing special, a simple test of two lines of text like an h1 and h2, at first i'm used to various escape shortcuts not using esc key so it makes to many elements.</s><s> at various times i try to move to elements since i'm used to drawing apps not a big deal just habit.</s><s> maybe others have spent more time to live with these or know the interface better. 
</s><s>the defaults seem to create the text box a width which is an unexpected behavior when i start to test teh view.</s><s> i found there was no rem unit. 
</s><s>now, around 5 mins it starts flaking out.</s><s> i want to at this point edit the code directly to see whats going on and fix it fast. 
</s><s>around 6 mins its now just freaking out.</s><s> in hide sight i might should have tinkered with position relative rather then true default static, but i'm not edits code so i don't even have the dom order in mind.</s><s> later i start adding a parent wrapper but it does not solve things for long. 
</s><s>around 10 i'm trying to make a very basic rows based stacking website, cropped image and text as i build and tinker and add breakpoints it just goes to hell. 
</s><s>as i go i use undo which gives wicked random results but not the results i want.</s><s> theres now magically some text boxes some hidden that i find later on. 
</s><s>at 16 mins i am trying a new break point to text-align: center or margin: 0 auto; the text. 
</s><s>end of vid 
</s><s>the issues i have with this and all other "helper" apps is that they try to interpret and help, while i know what i'm after but i do like having visual tools so i can design and code logically.</s><s> i know there are bugs to iron out with reflow its beta after all, its just that i just kept running into issue after issue, but i think these bugs are due to the nature in how the app is trying to think better then me rather then assist me. 
i want to visually tweak my css, thats all. 
-- 
html: 
in this next example in my research for making a mockup to send you and going over my old notes from reading the source of webkit's inspector i discovered that the dom talks directly to the style tag. 
</s><s>from this link: http://simonewebdesign.it/blog/how-to-make-browser-editor-with-html5-c ontenteditable/ he shows that the style tag if given a display: block; style it will directly display in the page, say wut?</s><s>!</s><s> he then uses contenteditable, while webkit safari inpector edition uses -webkit-user-modify: read-write; -webkit-user-modify: read-write-plaintext-only; 
either will work in this case, but i believe the newer webkit one acts better as it treats the text as nodes rather then separate p tags or a full on pre box. 

i removed his javascript in my example as it seemed pointless.</s><s> i also added some styles and a draggable function via jquery ui.</s><s> so now i can directly edit anything in the page if i type into the style box. http://artdesignfilmmarketingmedia.com/reflow/css-magic-code-live-edit ing-unicorns-are-forrealz.html scroll down the teh bottom for the p tag or just make one whereever 

!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s> sweet jimmy cakes !</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s> 

</s><s>the next thing i need is a visual selector and a way to map the edits to the node tree of how the dom and js loaded and the css declarations in order of load.</s><s> i researched and found this 
it's like webkit inspector!</s><s> it shows the various places a style is applied and even comments out the oldest.</s><s> so in my next experiment i will see if i can understand webkit source further to then use that or webkits source to build a map for editing. http://www.brothercake.com/site/resources/scripts/cssutilities/ as javascripts getcomputedstyle are rendered as base ex: %, em get returned as px 

</s><s>ultimately for a first draft i want to build a moveable inspector box and some sorta locking system to visually select the element and keep the box on the screen but not blocking.</s><s> safari webkits inspector is very smooth to me, it acts as text, the arrow keys hop around as i expect and it has some very smart regex in the background to know when you're on a digit and have a modifier key down and arrow keys to rapidly adjust numbers very much like you have in reflow. 
i have tinkered with visual tweaking with handles in the past via jquery ui to some effect and have built out base drawing tools in cocoa and processing.js but nothing went anywhere yet. 
-- 
grid frameworks like zurb foundation, bootstrap etc- take a lot of the boiler plate work out of the way.</s><s> its at the break points that things need to start altering. 
a typical standard mantra of mobile first sounds right.</s><s> but its not exactly the way you initially approach into reflows interface.</s><s> it feels like its desktop first in the app.</s><s> so you start drawing a box but then have to edit its styles in the tool bar to width 100%, then but something into it so you can then remove its initial height etc-

<post author="tripdragon_uh_2" timestamp="Feb 10, 2014 7:09 PM">
<s>this is in reguards to the previous weeks #reflowchat chat thread of twitter.</s><s> its also a summary to the great deal of research i have done in teh past looking for a decent webdesign and code tool.</s><s> i'm no super pro, i get by, i work, i tinker with many code projects(javascript, source, cocoa, processing ...</s><s> ) but ultimatly have to get back to normal bills work.</s><s> so i always wanted some tool that worked with design but produced proper code. 
i have two examples below. the first a long form video of me trying to use the app.</s><s> the second is a real html example of live code editing.</s><s> i am using a macbook air 10.5" small i know but i love it and it gets the job done. 

</s><s>video: http://artdesignfilmmarketingmedia.com/reflow/reflow-workflow.mov 
what you see here is a realtime use of reflow.</s><s> i am trying nothing special, a simple test of two lines of text like an h1 and h2, at first i'm used to various escape shortcuts not using esc key so it makes to many elements.</s><s> at various times i try to move to elements since i'm used to drawing apps not a big deal just habit.</s><s> maybe others have spent more time to live with these or know the interface better. 
</s><s>the defaults seem to create the text box a width which is an unexpected behavior when i start to test teh view.</s><s> i found there was no rem unit. 
</s><s>now, around 5 mins it starts flaking out.</s><s> i want to at this point edit the code directly to see whats going on and fix it fast. 
</s><s>around 6 mins its now just freaking out.</s><s> in hide sight i might should have tinkered with position relative rather then true default static, but i'm not edits code so i don't even have the dom order in mind.</s><s> later i start adding a parent wrapper but it does not solve things for long. 
</s><s>around 10 i'm trying to make a very basic rows based stacking website, cropped image and text as i build and tinker and add breakpoints it just goes to hell. 
</s><s>as i go i use undo which gives wicked random results but not the results i want.</s><s> theres now magically some text boxes some hidden that i find later on. 
</s><s>at 16 mins i am trying a new break point to text-align: center or margin: 0 auto; the text. 
</s><s>end of vid 
</s><s>the issues i have with this and all other "helper" apps is that they try to interpret and help, while i know what i'm after but i do like having visual tools so i can design and code logically.</s><s> i know there are bugs to iron out with reflow its beta after all, its just that i just kept running into issue after issue, but i think these bugs are due to the nature in how the app is trying to think better then me rather then assist me. 
i want to visually tweak my css, thats all. 
-- 
html: 
in this next example in my research for making a mockup to send you and going over my old notes from reading the source of webkit's inspector i discovered that the dom talks directly to the style tag. 
</s><s>from this link: http://simonewebdesign.it/blog/how-to-make-browser-editor-with-html5-c ontenteditable/ he shows that the style tag if given a display: block; style it will directly display in the page, say wut?</s><s>!</s><s> he then uses contenteditable, while webkit safari inpector edition uses -webkit-user-modify: read-write; -webkit-user-modify: read-write-plaintext-only; 
either will work in this case, but i believe the newer webkit one acts better as it treats the text as nodes rather then separate p tags or a full on pre box. 

i removed his javascript in my example as it seemed pointless.</s><s> i also added some styles and a draggable function via jquery ui.</s><s> so now i can directly edit anything in the page if i type into the style box. http://artdesignfilmmarketingmedia.com/reflow/css-magic-code-live-edit ing-unicorns-are-forrealz.html scroll down the teh bottom for the p tag or just make one whereever 

!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s> sweet jimmy cakes !</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s>!</s><s> 

</s><s>the next thing i need is a visual selector and a way to map the edits to the node tree of how the dom and js loaded and the css declarations in order of load.</s><s> i researched and found this 
it's like webkit inspector!</s><s> it shows the various places a style is applied and even comments out the oldest.</s><s> so in my next experiment i will see if i can understand webkit source further to then use that or webkits source to build a map for editing. http://www.brothercake.com/site/resources/scripts/cssutilities/ as javascripts getcomputedstyle are rendered as base ex: %, em get returned as px 

</s><s>ultimately for a first draft i want to build a moveable inspector box and some sorta locking system to visually select the element and keep the box on the screen but not blocking.</s><s> safari webkits inspector is very smooth to me, it acts as text, the arrow keys hop around as i expect and it has some very smart regex in the background to know when you're on a digit and have a modifier key down and arrow keys to rapidly adjust numbers very much like you have in reflow. 
i have tinkered with visual tweaking with handles in the past via jquery ui to some effect and have built out base drawing tools in cocoa and processing.js but nothing went anywhere yet. 
-- 
grid frameworks like zurb foundation, bootstrap etc- take a lot of the boiler plate work out of the way.</s><s> its at the break points that things need to start altering. 
a typical standard mantra of mobile first sounds right.</s><s> but its not exactly the way you initially approach into reflows interface.</s><s> it feels like its desktop first in the app.</s><s> so you start drawing a box but then have to edit its styles in the tool bar to width 100%, then but something into it so you can then remove its initial height etc- 
well since its not classed based for now it has its id system way of thinking, which is not bad per say.</s><s> i work in a module way as way when building magazine type of layouts.</s><s> this chuck of css is so direct its smarter to just put here since its used once, so i know how and where to read it to fix it. 
</s><s>say an image needs to slide more to the left margin-left: -100unit in-between a current breakpoint, but it only needs to happen to that element and not the whole lot.</s><s> in code i would just add it under that one style and bam done, to later be refactored maybe.</s><s> but right now its like lets add the break point to everything!</s><s> and bugs. 

</s><s>this post is getting long, so wrap up time.</s><s> i have not used reflow past the few times i have tried to use it to do something fast.</s><s> code gen mockup whatever, i always ran into bugs like in the video and just closed it as it was eating work time.</s><s> i will try macaw when ever it releases but don't expect it to be any better, it has mad sammy look to reflow and toolbarness.</s><s> i have tinkered with all of the online apps built for chrome firefox you name it.

<subject>Site finished - some thoughts</subject>
<post author="Alex Hallajian" timestamp="Feb 1, 2014 7:58 AM">
<s>just finished building my site using reflow. 
</s><s>i've been looking for a program like this for a long time.</s><s> the idea i'm getting from reading the posts here is that reflow is not suppose to be a program for development and is just suppose to be for mocking up websites.</s><s> i urge the reflow team to abandon this notion and steer the program towards a stronger full fledged web design software application. 
</s><s>now, i'm not saying it should be something to replace dreamweaver.</s><s> i think there's a perfect spot for reflow to work amongst dreamweaver, photoshop, and edge code.</s><s> the way everything is going now, all websites are going to have to be responsive.</s><s> you can't just make one version anymore.</s><s> it's not going to work on mobile and tablets. 
</s><s>and here's the main thing: i don't need a program to mockup designs for clients.</s><s> photoshop is more than enough for that; mockup the site for each platform and send the jpgs.</s><s> one way or another the design is going to have to be coded.</s><s> why get so close, just to not have the power to finish the site off? 
</s><s>my current workflow was to design the pages in reflow, then save the project and create a dreamweaver site.</s><s> then in dreamweaver, i wrote and saved custom regex scripts that i would use to add my javascript.</s><s> for example: find "</head>" replace with: "<script>...</script></head>".</s><s> i also created one for the <video> tags and also for each page with a vimeo embed.</s><s> if i so much as changed a pixel in the design, i'd have to save out, run the regex again for every page, and reupload.</s><s> very much a hassle, but the only way. 
i think reflow should be able to stand on its own, say with ftp capabilities.</s><s> but an example workflow i would like to see is this: 
start in photoshop.</s><s> import assets from illustrator, etc. layout the site.</s><s> (ps should have a grid-column-gutter tool) 
</s><s>go to reflow and layout the site for all media types.</s><s> add and design form elements.</s><s> basically the whole site.</s><s> have the ability to access all dom objects like <video> with attributes, and lay it down like any other div.</s><s> (i don't need or want to paste html in the page) 
</s><s>idea: global elements.</s><s> let's say i create a box with some text in it and name the box 'intro-text'.</s><s> i want to be able to save the style and apply it to other boxes.</s><s> effectivly, it creates a class and everything would be in one condensed css file. 
</s><s>now, the user can upload their site via ftp or... 
</s><s>open up edge code and add some js in the header or anywhere else.</s><s> i haven't used edge code yet but i'm assuming it can be used for this.</s><s> the next or alternate step would be to... 
</s><s>open the site in dreamweaver.</s><s> here the user can add php, js, mysql, and everything else.</s><s> but... still have to option to go back to reflow, make adjustments, and go back to dreamweaver.</s><s> i know this is probably asking a lot, but it would be amazing.</s><s> but also, thinking about it, isn't this the direction it needs to go?</s><s> i use dynamic link all the time in video production.</s><s> i want to use it here too. 
</s><s>i've been using dreamweaver for so long i don't even know what else is out there anymore.</s><s> i used to use golive and used dreamweaver when it was by macromedia.</s><s> i say this because i'm not even sure dreamweaver has any outside competition.</s><s> what's the alternative?</s><s> on a macro level, how users view content on the web is changing and our tools have to keep up.</s><s> this is a perfect moment for adobe to deliver a tool that will allow developers and designers to create contemporary websites in an efficient way that serves current technology. 
i don't want to see adobe drop the ball because they didn't keep up.</s><s> i mean, i only know about http://macaw.co/ because of this forum.</s><s> i have to check it out now.</s><s> there's a reason adobe's video production side is the only game in town: they consistently deliver the tools i need as soon as i need them. 
i didn't mean for this to become a rant but i see the opportunity here with reflow.</s><s> i checked it out without knowing anyhting about, then was so excited to be building a site so fast.</s><s> i applaud the reflow team for the software even at this point.</s><s> it's great.</s><s> but i reiterate, i don't need a program to mockup sites.</s><s> i need to deliver responsive, final products. 
</s><s>also, i know it's in beta and all, but what better time to talk about this then now? 
</s><s>thanks.</s><s>

<post author="Alex Hallajian" timestamp="Feb 1, 2014 7:58 AM">
<s>just finished building my site using reflow. 
</s><s>i've been looking for a program like this for a long time.</s><s> the idea i'm getting from reading the posts here is that reflow is not suppose to be a program for development and is just suppose to be for mocking up websites.</s><s> i urge the reflow team to abandon this notion and steer the program towards a stronger full fledged web design software application. 
</s><s>now, i'm not saying it should be something to replace dreamweaver.</s><s> i think there's a perfect spot for reflow to work amongst dreamweaver, photoshop, and edge code.</s><s> the way everything is going now, all websites are going to have to be responsive.</s><s> you can't just make one version anymore.</s><s> it's not going to work on mobile and tablets. 
</s><s>and here's the main thing: i don't need a program to mockup designs for clients.</s><s> photoshop is more than enough for that; mockup the site for each platform and send the jpgs.</s><s> one way or another the design is going to have to be coded.</s><s> why get so close, just to not have the power to finish the site off? 
</s><s>my current workflow was to design the pages in reflow, then save the project and create a dreamweaver site.</s><s> then in dreamweaver, i wrote and saved custom regex scripts that i would use to add my javascript.</s><s> for example: find "</head>" replace with: "<script>...</script></head>".</s><s> i also created one for the <video> tags and also for each page with a vimeo embed.</s><s> if i so much as changed a pixel in the design, i'd have to save out, run the regex again for every page, and reupload.</s><s> very much a hassle, but the only way. 
i think reflow should be able to stand on its own, say with ftp capabilities.</s><s> but an example workflow i would like to see is this: 
start in photoshop.</s><s> import assets from illustrator, etc. layout the site.</s><s> (ps should have a grid-column-gutter tool) 
</s><s>go to reflow and layout the site for all media types.</s><s> add and design form elements.</s><s> basically the whole site.</s><s> have the ability to access all dom objects like <video> with attributes, and lay it down like any other div.</s><s> (i don't need or want to paste html in the page) 
</s><s>idea: global elements.</s><s> let's say i create a box with some text in it and name the box 'intro-text'.</s><s> i want to be able to save the style and apply it to other boxes.</s><s> effectivly, it creates a class and everything would be in one condensed css file. 
</s><s>now, the user can upload their site via ftp or... 
</s><s>open up edge code and add some js in the header or anywhere else.</s><s> i haven't used edge code yet but i'm assuming it can be used for this.</s><s> the next or alternate step would be to... 
</s><s>open the site in dreamweaver.</s><s> here the user can add php, js, mysql, and everything else.</s><s> but... still have to option to go back to reflow, make adjustments, and go back to dreamweaver.</s><s> i know this is probably asking a lot, but it would be amazing.</s><s> but also, thinking about it, isn't this the direction it needs to go?</s><s> i use dynamic link all the time in video production.</s><s> i want to use it here too. 
</s><s>i've been using dreamweaver for so long i don't even know what else is out there anymore.</s><s> i used to use golive and used dreamweaver when it was by macromedia.</s><s> i say this because i'm not even sure dreamweaver has any outside competition.</s><s> what's the alternative?</s><s> on a macro level, how users view content on the web is changing and our tools have to keep up.</s><s> this is a perfect moment for adobe to deliver a tool that will allow developers and designers to create contemporary websites in an efficient way that serves current technology. 
i don't want to see adobe drop the ball because they didn't keep up.</s><s> i mean, i only know about http://macaw.co/ because of this forum.</s><s> i have to check it out now.</s><s> there's a reason adobe's video production side is the only game in town: they consistently deliver the tools i need as soon as i need them. 
i didn't mean for this to become a rant but i see the opportunity here with reflow.</s><s> i checked it out without knowing anyhting about, then was so excited to be building a site so fast.</s><s> i applaud the reflow team for the software even at this point.</s><s> it's great.</s><s> but i reiterate, i don't need a program to mockup sites.</s><s> i need to deliver responsive, final products. 
</s><s>also, i know it's in beta and all, but what better time to talk about this then now? 
</s><s>thanks.</s><s>

<s>hi, 
</s><s>i know this is likely to be a big ask, but is it going to be possible to set gutters in em or px at some stage? 
</s><s>in my opinion, gutter width should be relative to type size.</s><s> my type size increases a little as the page (screen) size increases - due to a likely decrease in resolution and increase in viewing distance - but not nearly at the rate of the page size.</s><s> it's likely a logarithmic relationship, but good luck figuring that one out!

<s>you can create a prototype of a responsive layout in reflow and see how your layout will respond at various device sizes.</s><s> at the moment, reflow doesn't have the ability to use assets created in animate.</s><s> but, this is something that has been tested and discussed. 
</s><s>the design that you create in reflow can be previewed in chrome via the menu item view-> preview in chrome.</s><s> this will open up the html in chrome and show you your design.</s><s> the html and css will be placed in your reflow project directory in an 'assets' directory.</s><s> if you want to add interactivity to the design, you can take the html and css into your favorite text editor and add javascript from there.

<s>a new reflow user here so i apologise for my ignorance. 
</s><s>so if i get this right reflow is great for showing or creating very basic sites and how they could look in different screen sizes, but if things like animation or custom interactivity (eg drop and drag) were needed in those sites then reflow wouldn't be able to accomodate those at the moment? 
</s><s>what i'm thinking in a prefect world would be to merge reflow into edge so that you can export your site out and still have a few different versions of it exported out at the same time.

<s>hey mungmeister, 
i don't think that's it's purpose atm.</s><s> it maybe in the future but not right now. 
</s><s>it's just a basic program to show how a client's site could look (ie a mockup) on different screen size devices. 
i dunno how many designers are actually using it for that purpose and i wonder if adobe have any data on that too (not just on how many people are downloading the software). 
</s><s>but i'm with you, ie in the future i'd love to see it produce fully functional websites that rescale and adjust to appropriate screen sizes and my biggest wish is that they can make edge the same where i can have an animation that has buttons which can be shifted around depending on the users screen sizes.

<subject>My Evaluation of Adobe Edge Code CC</subject>
<post author="smartcookie media" timestamp="Jan 30, 2014 7:18 AM">
<s>pros: - conversion of images for export of assets from ps works well - reflow interface is quite sophisticated and the gui makes it really easy to conceptualize the how your composition will flow when resizes with all the breakpoints. - the artboard has a configurable grid system with gutters.</s><s> you can snap objects to the grid.</s><s> this is very powerful and would dramatically help with the designers in colouring inside the lines. - they provide a pretty good demo for you to poke around and learn from - the html it exports can be not bad.</s><s> see caveat below - when presenting the composition to the client, you are meant to present the html export and let them play around with resizing the browser.</s><s> you can host this on a server and clients can get a better concept of how it should behave.</s><s> see caveat below 

</s><s>cons: - when converting ps to reflow, it really does a poor job of converting the text positions and dimensions.</s><s> you almost have to redo it all.</s><s> it could cause a lot of duplication of work - when converting ps to reflow, the group / layer structure all gets lost and you must create the dom structure by grouping objects.</s><s> this is time consuming and unintuitive - the role of the designer would have to adapt.</s><s> the designer would have to understand min-width, max width, floating, position absolute/relative, etc. this might be a really big stretch. - although the export to html works well.</s><s> currently on chrome is supported.</s><s> adapting it to ie8 would take considerable time. - the html is not bad, it's a good starting point, however it is all id based and there is no reuse of styles by using classes.</s><s> the html would take a lot of reworking. - the css is not bad, however its really verbose, uses non-essential properties, doesn't use classes and does not reuse common styles.</s><s> you may be able to borrow components, but not use it entirely - if you had to present a static export of the composition to the client, there is currently no way to export as image from reflow a jpg or pdfs.</s><s> you would have to screenshot the html in each of its form factors - you cannot actually design in reflow, only add divs, text boxes, optimized images, form elements, etc- 
maybe someone can comment on my cons?

<s>hey smartcookie media, some thoughts, also love to get more of your feedback: <quote>
<s>when converting ps to reflow, it really does a poor job of converting the text positions and dimensions.</s><s> you almost have to redo it all.</s><s> it could cause a lot of duplication of work 
</s></quote>we'd love to get a psd from you where this is causing issues.</s><s> we're actively trying to find users pain points with ps conversion.</s><s> if there are discrepencies, especially on text, we want to see it.</s><s> feel free to email me a psd at sewalker at adobe dot com. can just be the text layers, no need for a big huge file.</s><s> <quote>
<s>when converting ps to reflow, the group / layer structure all gets lost and you must create the dom structure by grouping objects.</s><s> this is time consuming and unintuitive 
</s></quote>do you feel like your psds are a good representation of the dom?</s><s> i feel like when i design in ps, i'm thinking about the dom, but i know not all designers work that way.</s><s> so we've been pretty hands off on converting folders from ps into groups.</s><s> if you could talk a bit more about your specific usage, that'd be cool.</s><s> <quote>
<s>the role of the designer would have to adapt.</s><s> the designer would have to understand min-width, max width, floating, position absolute/relative, etc. this might be a really big stretch. 
</s></quote>y u no like css?</s><s> we actually think there is a growing group of designers and developers who all simply work on the web, and css is their first priority.</s><s> but it's all in how reflow is used, we know we need to let people who begin in ps have a really smooth transition.</s><s> this kind of goes towards your last point, which i'll get to. 
<quote>
<s>although the export to html works well.</s><s> currently on chrome is supported.</s><s> adapting it to ie8 would take considerable time.

<post author="smartcookie media" timestamp="Jan 30, 2014 7:18 AM">
<s>pros: - conversion of images for export of assets from ps works well - reflow interface is quite sophisticated and the gui makes it really easy to conceptualize the how your composition will flow when resizes with all the breakpoints. - the artboard has a configurable grid system with gutters.</s><s> you can snap objects to the grid.</s><s> this is very powerful and would dramatically help with the designers in colouring inside the lines. - they provide a pretty good demo for you to poke around and learn from - the html it exports can be not bad.</s><s> see caveat below - when presenting the composition to the client, you are meant to present the html export and let them play around with resizing the browser.</s><s> you can host this on a server and clients can get a better concept of how it should behave.</s><s> see caveat below 

</s><s>cons: - when converting ps to reflow, it really does a poor job of converting the text positions and dimensions.</s><s> you almost have to redo it all.</s><s> it could cause a lot of duplication of work - when converting ps to reflow, the group / layer structure all gets lost and you must create the dom structure by grouping objects.</s><s> this is time consuming and unintuitive - the role of the designer would have to adapt.</s><s> the designer would have to understand min-width, max width, floating, position absolute/relative, etc. this might be a really big stretch. - although the export to html works well.</s><s> currently on chrome is supported.</s><s> adapting it to ie8 would take considerable time. - the html is not bad, it's a good starting point, however it is all id based and there is no reuse of styles by using classes.</s><s> the html would take a lot of reworking. - the css is not bad, however its really verbose, uses non-essential properties, doesn't use classes and does not reuse common styles.</s><s> you may be able to borrow components, but not use it entirely - if you had to present a static export of the composition to the client, there is currently no way to export as image from reflow a jpg or pdfs.</s><s> you would have to screenshot the html in each of its form factors - you cannot actually design in reflow, only add divs, text boxes, optimized images, form elements, etc-

<s>hey smartcookie media, some thoughts, also love to get more of your feedback: <quote>
<s>when converting ps to reflow, it really does a poor job of converting the text positions and dimensions.</s><s> you almost have to redo it all.</s><s> it could cause a lot of duplication of work 
</s></quote>we'd love to get a psd from you where this is causing issues.</s><s> we're actively trying to find users pain points with ps conversion.</s><s> if there are discrepencies, especially on text, we want to see it.</s><s> feel free to email me a psd at sewalker at adobe dot com. can just be the text layers, no need for a big huge file.</s><s> <quote>
<s>when converting ps to reflow, the group / layer structure all gets lost and you must create the dom structure by grouping objects.</s><s> this is time consuming and unintuitive 
</s></quote>do you feel like your psds are a good representation of the dom?</s><s> i feel like when i design in ps, i'm thinking about the dom, but i know not all designers work that way.</s><s> so we've been pretty hands off on converting folders from ps into groups.</s><s> if you could talk a bit more about your specific usage, that'd be cool.</s><s> <quote>
<s>the role of the designer would have to adapt.</s><s> the designer would have to understand min-width, max width, floating, position absolute/relative, etc. this might be a really big stretch. 
</s></quote>y u no like css?</s><s> we actually think there is a growing group of designers and developers who all simply work on the web, and css is their first priority.</s><s> but it's all in how reflow is used, we know we need to let people who begin in ps have a really smooth transition.</s><s> this kind of goes towards your last point, which i'll get to.

<post author="sewalker162" timestamp="Nov 18, 2013 12:47 PM">
<s>since reflow is meant to be a web design tool, some of the rules of using fonts on the web apply to us too. 
</s><s>for instance, some fonts on your computer may not have a web font version. 
a lot of fonts are available through typekit.</s><s> you can use typekit within reflow as well to gain access to a lot of additional fonts.</s><s> click the "custom" tab in the previous screen shot to add a typekit id.</s><s> you'll need a typekit account to use it, you can take a look here: https://typekit.com/fonts 
however, we don't allow local fonts in the way you describe.</s><s> again, this is due to using fonts on the web, and we want to be true to what your design will look like when viewed online.

<s>since reflow is meant to be a web design tool, some of the rules of using fonts on the web apply to us too. 
</s><s>for instance, some fonts on your computer may not have a web font version. 
a lot of fonts are available through typekit.</s><s> you can use typekit within reflow as well to gain access to a lot of additional fonts.</s><s> click the "custom" tab in the previous screen shot to add a typekit id.</s><s> you'll need a typekit account to use it, you can take a look here: https://typekit.com/fonts 
however, we don't allow local fonts in the way you describe.</s><s> again, this is due to using fonts on the web, and we want to be true to what your design will look like when viewed online.

<s>hi ton, 
</s><s>i'll give it a shot. 
</s><s>reflow is primarily intended as a means for a designer to express a responsive web page design in something much closer to real world than they would with a static drawing tool (such as photoshop).</s><s> a design expressed in reflow can be shared with clients in a way that the client can easily experience how the layout changes and adapts (via the responsive breakpoints) - as the canvas changes size for instance.</s><s> something not possible (as fluidly) with a static drawing tool. 
</s><s>reflow is meant as a rapid comping tool as well where you can use most of the drawing tool metaphors you may be used while constraining you to what's possible in html (behind the scenes). 
</s><s>the final reflow based design can be handed off to a developer if so desired where the css can be extracted quite easily. 
</s><s>you can also use reflow as a css sandbox, play around with responsive layouts or element styles visually - and extract the css for elements directly in the tool via the css button in the breadcrumb bar. e.g.</s><s> as a learning tool if nothing else. 
</s><s>it is important to note that currently the html/css produced is not really intended for production use (it's not developer friendly in any way), but when you preview in chrome and save your project you can snag the preview stylesheets or html from the 'assets' folder if so desired. 
</s><s>reflow is only currently in an experimental "preview" state, however going forward i am positive it will evolve into something that is more compatible with production use (as far as code generation is concerned and designer-developer workflow).</s><s> stay tuned.

<s>hey there, 
in it's current preview incarnation reflow is intended purely as a design tool, essentially a means for realizing a responsive page design that is much more than the static comp you'd get out of say photoshop or similar tools.</s><s> the designs are fluid in nature and can be shared with potential clients as a preview of sorts in a fidelity equal to what they would get a final hand coded page (which clearly would take much longer than sketching out with reflow).</s><s> the designs in reflow are also gauranteed to be within the constraints of the web, as opposed to something produced with photoshop which may or may not be "realistic" as far as what's feasible in the real world, reason being of course is that you are designing within the browser itself. 
</s><s>so again, i stress, "in its current state", reflow is not intended as a production tool.</s><s> but of course, stay tuned.</s><s> many great things coming.

<s>i am really disappointed with the way this critical fact is so burried and you have spent time digging in the forums before it jumps out at you that you can't generate html..</s><s> if i can't generate useful html from reflow then how is it anything more than a way to see how my responsive site will work when i resize the browser from destkop to mobile screen? 
</s><s>maybe i am missing something really major here but its seems that the large investment i make in learning to use reflow (and i don't think you will deny there is a considerable f effort as the very long getting started tutorial attests) doesn't really let me leverage that effort into a real web site. 
</s><s>isn't it true that any web site designer trying to build a responsive page faces this problem: how to get real html that they can use?</s><s> if i am not alone in this then best visual designer i have round that lets you generate real html is jetstrap: https://jetstrap.com/.</s><s> and it has problems that makes it less than ideal.</s><s> i see there are lots of visual design programs out there for building responsive sites (http://vandelaydesign.com/blog/design/bootstrap-themes/).

<s>i doubt it.</s><s> edge reflow was never meant to be a production tool, only a quick mockup designer to show clients before you actually do the work of creating the real website or application.</s><s> i discovered that 15 minutes into using the preview when it was first released and discovered there is no way to actually export html and asking questions in the forum brought the real purpose to light.</s><s> the website details deceive as to what it really is meant for. 
</s><s>you can get the html and css by previewing the layout in a browser then copying the css and html from the temp folder before they get removed automatically.</s><s> the problem i discovered was that these files are not complete and not something you would use in production due to only being compatable with the chrome web browser.</s><s> it's a total waste of time for any real purpose and was created by one of adobe's teams because someone needed a way to quickly mockup a show and tell for corporate clients. 
</s><s>the closest tool adobe has to what a production designer would want is muse but there you have to create desktop and mobile versions seperate.</s><s> bringing up to the design team for muse having the capability of creating a responsive css file with media queries instead of three seperate sites, seems to have fallen on deaf ears because it is adobe's way of the highway from my experience.</s><s> sometimes they give in and change things if a majority complain but mostly it's however adobe want's the tools to work and for edge reflow it is just a mockup tool with deceiving marketing.

<post author="at_play" timestamp="Jan 26, 2014 8:34 PM">
<s>if you go through the edge reflow marketing page at the very top of the page it states "design the responsive web" and a graphic below showing what would appear to be a web page design within the software.Ê it is a web page depiction because it specifically states "design the responsive web" above it emphasis on "web." Ê http://html.adobe.com/edge/reflow/ Ê Ê lets look at the paragraph titledÊ "web layout" Ê "design in reflow for the web.</s><s> move between design environments easily while maintaining your design fidelity.</s><s> reflow uses css and behaves like a browser, making it easier to translate your designs to the web.</s><s> gain the predictability of web layout, with the freedom of an adobe design tool." Ê this paragraph implies a fully functional design tool.Ê it uses css, makes it easier to translate your designs to the web.</s><s> the implication is you will have a working mockup you can further extend and develop outside the tool itself.</s><s> you may say, no!, no where does it say any of this.Ê it actually doesn't have to, the implication is there that it does and that is all that is needed the implication and what an average user would assume or understand the tool to be.Ê also note that no where on the page does it state it can't which also by intention or not, leads one to expect this to be a design tool for the web with capability of exporting the designs. Ê to further prove this point let me take you through other portions of this adobe edge reflow site and detail specifics in actual videos available on adobe tv detailing edge reflow and the newest version. Ê the very next section statesÊ "a native web surface provides the precise and intuitive controls you need to turn your vision into reality.</s><s> use reflow and the latest css specifications, including css regions and css filters, to create powerful responsive designs" Ê this further leads to the implication and assumptions that edge reflow will allow for full work flow that will lead to a design process that will produce a final output for the web.</s><s> indication that it exports the css and html.</s><s> it does not specifically state in words this but the implication is reinforced from earlier content in the page. Ê further down you seeÊ "preview and share your designs in your browser or on a device " under "previewing and sharing.</s><s> i want to bring your attention the statement "in your browser", no where does it specifically state google's chrome browser.Ê i use firefox and rarely ie, i never use chrome so when it states "in my borwser" i assume it works in any browser because that is the implication.</s><s> this is also misleading, it isn't any browser as it leads you to believe it is only the chrome browser which you have to specifically download and install if you don't already have it, i didn't.Ê another misleading statement. Ê at the bottom of the page there are testimonials about edge reflow apparently from real world companies and the imdication is that they use edge reflow to create their web projects from start to end.</s><s> this can't be true due to the nature of edge reflow but they do add to the over all impression that edge reflow is indeed a complete design tool to create real world web pages.</s><s> they give authority to this false impression but seals the deal for anyone that wants to use this in a production environment.</s><s> the testimonials are evidence that edge reflow is a production environment tool. Ê Ê now, jump over to the faq section and the very first paragraph specifically statesÊ "extract css code you can hand off to developers." Ê this would be an exact match for "what does the reflow website claim that seems to suggest it generates css and html?" Ê now lets further look at more misleading statements on the edge reflow website, specifically focusing on the faq section.</s><s> "who should use edge reflow?</s><s> edge reflow is ideal for web designers who want to create responsive layouts and css visuals targeting the latest browsers" Ê no, it actually can't.Ê it only is able to be displayed in the chrome browser directly from edge reflow and if you manually copy the css and html that is generated and look at it in any other browser there are lots of errors and funky things happen. Ê "built on webkit, edge reflow offers 1-to-1 web rendering capabilities for design within the constraints of browsers." Ê webkit is only certain browsers, ie for instance does not use it.Ê again, misleading statement. Ê Ê "css extraction capabilities offer a direct workflow between designers and developers.</s><s> " Ê again an exact statement that not just implies but makes a specific claim that the css and therefore the html can be exported. Ê Ê this is more of a nit pick but the following section actually doesn't make sense. Ê "what are shiny web features?</s><s> we love beautiful designs here at adobe and strive to continue to move the web forward.</s><s> as new css standards become available, we'll do our best to support them in our tools as soon as possible." this doesn't actually answer the question and the question itselfÊ doesn't really make sense.</s><s> i understand what was meant to be there but what actually is, makes no sense.Ê it makes me think this is created by support staff from india because most of my experience with adobe support doesn't make a whole lot of sense either. Ê Ê Ê in the sectionÊ "how is edge reflow different from adobe muse cc or dreamweaver cc?"Ê the following statement is made.</s><s> "while edge reflow creates html during the design process, the tool is focused on enabling designers to share their responsive design intent and for css to be extracted for use either by the designer or a developer as part of the website production process." Ê this can be read different ways but looking at it from an average user it does imply exporting of html and css is possible and inherent in the software. Ê through out the website it emphasises sharing amoung web designers.Ê the thing that isn't said is that everyone must also have edge reflow, the assumption of whoever wrote text for this site is that edge reflow is being used.Ê this would be a false assumption and the average web designer or developer reading through this site would not make that connection. Ê now to further point out specifics this last one is the final nail in the coffin of whether the website implies or otherwise states that the html and\or css can be exported from the program. Ê "what's the basic workflow in edge reflow?" Ê "...</s><s>once the different comps are ready, you can preview them in the browser or on devices via edge inspect before extracting the css code for use in development." Ê focus on " before extracting the css code for use in development." Ê Ê let's switch to two video's available and linked to from the edge reflow website and accessable other ways besides coming to the edge reflow site.</s><s> yes someone could never come to the edge reflow site and still get the impression that the software can indeed export html and css for production websites. Ê i want to also note that you never have to actually go the edge reflow site to actually download and install the software so there are probably people that never even see the website. Ê the overview of reflow video http://tv.adobe.com/watch/adobe-edge-reflow/overview-of-reflow/ Ê uses terms that make it seem to be a full fledge production design tool.Ê no where is it mentioned or text provided on the video page that it can't export html or css but the terms used in context of describing the capabilities make it seem it would.Ê though it never states one way or the other which is the problem and would lead an average web designer to conclude it would be possible in light ofÊ describing the use of media query which is a css specific thing and the capability of viewing the design in an external device, specifically a phone. Ê why would these things be possible if it weren't actually able to create production level code.Ê this is the impression the video gives and that is all that matters. Ê Ê the next video what's new in adobe edge reflow cc preview 7 states the following http://tv.adobe.com/watch/adobe-edge-reflow/whats-new-in-adobe-edge-re flow-cc-preview-7/ Ê "it works in the browser it works in a device" Ê futher statements talk specifically about "the dom" and other html and css specific language that in context makes it seem this is a production level tool. Ê the overall website for adobe edge reflow does give the impression this is a production level tool which exports css and html.</s><s> there are specific statements that lead to this false assumtion and specific statements that down right state that it can. Ê in any video i have seen talking about or demonstrating any aspect of adobe edge reflow it is being talked about as a production level tool that helps designers create and share designs as well as help create production websites.Ê the testimonials at the bottom of the adobe edge reflow website also lead to this false assumption. Ê now let's read what the ftc, federal trade commission has to say about false and misleading marketing.</s><s> the example in this blog post is talking about nissan trucks but the focus is more on the over all impression the marketing give for the capabilities of the product.</s><s> what really is interesting is how the ftc is focusing also on the types of media being used like phone cameras and what the overall impression of the actors / participants in these video's are doing to spur on the view that the product has the capability being advertised.</s><s> which in this case, the nissan truck, can't do. Ê the indication in the adobe produced videos for the adobe edge reflow also gives impressions that the tool can be used for something it can't.Ê even though adobe employees and staff state this is a tool for designing mockups the video's and tutorials i have seen give the impression it can also be used to mockup production level sites and some have actually stated this on camera.Ê i don't have the time to link and point out every statement specifically the above should be enough to reasonably describe how an average web designer would come to false conclusions about the capability of the software.Ê if you still don't see that, i don't know, your brain must work different than mine. Ê Ê ftc blog post about nissan trucks which in an overall similarity can be applied to the marketing of adobe edge reflow. http://business.ftc.gov/blog/2014/01/less-meets-eye Ê Ê Ê now go back to the faq page on the adobe edge reflow website and scroll down ? of the way to the bottom and hidden among the sections is a statement that specifically tells that exporting of html is not possible. Ê first one would actually have to go to the website, notice there are different sections like overview, features, faq etc... then specifically go to the faw page and read all the way down to where it states this.Ê it is not said, stated or made known anywhere other than in that section of the faq which not many people would ever see or read. Ê the ftc in their business section under legal documentation and what is required and also in their web advertising section makes it very clear that you can not hide statements that the users of your website need to know.</s><s> specifically about privacy, marketing assoctiations like being an affiliate to an advertiser whom you review or promote the products and also about locations of links and where and how often they have to be displayed.</s><s> the state of california also has several similar if not more intrusive regulation about these things. Ê how that would fall into play here is the hiding, which it can be viewed in this way the statement about exporting not being possible towards the bottom of the faq.</s><s> especially when other statements above this state it is possible and the over all impression given from the website this is possible. Ê to fix this just state at the top of the website and on other sections of the adobe infrastructure when talking or displaying anything about adobe edge reflow that it at this time can not export html or css.Ê that would prevent most people from wasting their time with it and save people like those participating in this thread to countless hours or days of learning a tool that can't actually be used in production. Ê you know what is interesting to me, the actual intention to never make this product have that capability.</s><s> it took many many complaints for the adobe designers to realize this actually is not a useful tool to anyone but less than 1% of designers out there.

i have worked on browser engines before, and i know creating 'cross-browser layout' is not for the faint of the heart even for the most expert engineers who have implemented layout for various browsers.</s><s> i understand your frustration but the task before us is monumental and we are chipping away at it.

<post author="at_play" timestamp="Jan 26, 2014 9:37 PM">
<s>that was in reply toÊ "what does the reflow website claim that seems to suggest it generates css and html?" Ê those are very specific things about the website itself and the overall impression being given about reflow. Ê the other things you mention don't really have anything to do with the website or promotions but it does seem when talking to specific individuals actually on the team creating reflow there are conradictions between website and features. Ê i stopped using reflow because the code that is generated is not really cross browser, there is or was no code specific to mozilla or ie in the css.</s><s> compare the css generated by reflow and the code generated by muse and there are huge gaps, or were, between the two css.Ê Ê if you look at the overall product, reflow, why as the designers of this tool would you not automatically come to the conclusion people wouldn't actually want to have a exported version of what they see in the tool to use in production websites?</s><s> yeah it probably seems a bit harsh and maybe less pro adobe some of the things i state in my post but it is just my personal experiences that make me feel certain ways.Ê there actually have been less access to developers themselves at adobe then what you may believe. Ê edge reflow itself if it exported production quality cross browser code i would switch to it as a development tool and stop using most of the other tools i use currently.</s><s> it has great potential and the features that are being added seem great except with the caveat of not actually being about to use it in production.Ê nice show and tell software but when the client says that is great upload it and get it working, you have to step back and say no this is just show and tell to see what you like we actually have to go develop this in something else now that you approve.Ê good luck with that.ÊÊ everyone is different i guess but most of the vocal people i see think more the way i do than see this as a show and tell software.</s><s> i uninstalled it and stopped trying to learn more how to use it due to that. Ê i would think that focusing on exporting production quality cross browser code would be more a priority than what seems to be.Ê i am glad it is being developed, i understand it is a prerelease software and not even beta really but adobe sure is promoting the heck out of it as a development tool which as you say isn't quite there yet and the code should not be used in production.Ê adobe is promoting like it is production ready though, contradictions all over on that. Ê if i still used the software i would gladly contact you one on one to share my experience and give you bug reports and suggestions but since it can't output code for production i just don't use it.Ê instead i use muse, edge animate and hand coding when i need to.ÊÊ i seem to be switching more to tools like muse now, before i hand coded mostly but try to hand code edge animate animations and you will go insane so switching to the wyswyg visual editors now more. Ê thanks for letting me input even though it may not be what you wanted to hear and may allow you to clarify in other places besides the forums about your products. Ê thanks.

<s>i don't think complaining is ever doing anyone a favor.</s><s> especially in this case.</s><s> this is a preview release, and everywhere i look i see preview.</s><s> and i have never seen clear examples illustrating that they approve of using the exported html.</s><s> it's all about prototyping interactive designs at this point. 
a few quotes from the reflow website: <quote>
<s>start responsive designs faster and create high-fidelity prototypes 
reflow uses css and behaves like a browser, making it easier to translate your designs to the web. 
</s><s>easily extract css from your project for further development in edge code cc, dreamweaver cc, or another code editor of your choice. 
</s></quote>
</s><s>none of that seems to imply it exports html (and that it is a complete solution), and no where on the website does it state it exports html.</s><s> they have always focused on the css reflow provides.</s><s> the videos all discuss that it exports css, and allows you to make great interactive design prototypes. 
i did actually post a link to a resource i used to help with reflow export.</s><s> it's really not that complicated.</s><s> and with all of your authorship experience i'm sure you know in development no holy grail exists.</s><s> everything is a tool that either is used in the pipeline, or isn't.</s><s> in the case of reflow i have used it in a few lightweight projects (small static designs of 5-6 pages). 
</s><s>again the link to the extension with a pretty detailed video is located here: http://blog.brackets.io/2013/09/26/reflow-cleaner-extension/ and i recommend following his steps, then finesse the code a bit yourself.</s><s> it's not a complicated process.</s><s> the only reason the exported html isn't ideal at the moment is the incorrect semantic markup. 
</s><s>it's great you pay close attention to feedback.</s><s> i wish you had paid close attention to mine, and watched the great video that pretty much completely details, and answers your questions.</s><s> no tutorial is really required.

<s>i'm sorry to disagree.</s><s> but i feel this thread has just been people complaining.</s><s> there is an excellent thread elsewhere here requesting proper html/css export maybe providing details on what you'd like to see in the export, the controls you'd like to have, etc. would be much more productive than the big rants i've seen here.</s><s> i applaud adobe for handling it all with grace. 
</s><s>as a side note.</s><s> reflow will not be this magic solution.</s><s> (just as macaw won't be) the design community is so excited about these tools, but in a real development workflow they are quite limited.</s><s> because anything beyond a few web pages is just not going to benefit from these tools until they integrate frameworks, less, scss, etc. not to mention once you try integrating the designs with a cms, or custom web app...don't plan on ever going back, since editing the project design will require using the static files.</s><s> this is not exactly the most efficient workflow.</s><s> at least for the next few years i envision that these tools will work great for interactive prototypes, and simple designs...but i would currently not expect more than that from them.</s><s> i use bootstrap, foundation, custom grid frameworks, less, sass, etc on a daily basis, and the place of reflow is confined to the very early stages at the moment...but even then i usually just generate the image files from ps...and then handcode the prototypes in bootstrap/*insert another framework*, because in the end i'll have to convert the css to a less/scss which is just extra work.

<s>i concur with the general frustration, time spent (and wasted), and misunderstanding the reflow was something other than it is.</s><s> and all of this could have - should have - been avoided by one simple addition to the team's staff: a marketing authority who could consume every bit of *preview*, be it video, documentation, marketing piece, etc. and then determine whether the facts matched the message.

<s>my personal opinion, given all the feedback on this particular thread and what i now know about the product, is to get the code it does generate a bit more useable/production ready.</s><s> i think working on getting the css truly cross-browser compatible (i presume it's not based on feedback here.</s><s> i haven't tried it.</s><s>) and the html code cleaned-up so that it can be copied without too much post-reflow-manipulation would be a great next release.</s><s> i think that would make the app fit into more pipelines sooner than later and prevent people from having to start from scratch in another program jsut to try and reproduce what this already does in reflow/chrome. 
i have to agree that at this stage it really doesn't make sense to use it if i can' take work already done here and port it over easily to another app to add the non-responsive specific features.</s><s> all it serves at this point is to provide the feedback to you guys that other users have already given i think.</s><s> i too was under the impression based on the website and marketing material that it would generate usable production code for me at the end of the day even if it is just a preview app (whatever that means).</s><s> i also went through all of the tutorials to learn how to use it only to be slightly dissapointed for a while, but it looks like you guys are working towards making it a truly productive responsive design toolin the future...hopfully near future. 
i hope the end result is an end-to-end solution for responsive designs.</s><s> a plus would be including the ability to handle dynamic data or some back and forth compatibility between muse/dreamweaver/edge code/visual studio/other tools much like premiere/after effects/speed grade work today, with a non-destructive approach so that going back to reflow doesn't overwrite work done in the other tools.</s><s> if all it did ever was help manage the (production-ready) css, html to make it responsive and pass the generated code off to another app, i'd be happy to use it as my primary design tool. 
</s><s>overall, i think it's a great idea for a visual tool for designing repsonsive sites and hope it ends up becoming the product many of us probably thought it was to begin with.

<s>chris-- just to chime in, i'm a pretty early muse adopter, and i've been (mostly) satisfied with it - however, if adobe could somehow combine the features of reflow (excellent responsive design) with muse (excellent visual layout and relatively clean code), i'd be a really happy camper.</s><s> however, i think some of the folks you turned to muse might be disappointed in the results; muse is fantastic as a prototyping tool, and does push out relatively decent sites, but it's not suited for the more complicated cms development that a lot of posters are mentioning.

<s>every package still seems to be focused on their specific target.</s><s> i'd say it's just your perspective on the apps where you get that conclusion.</s><s> illustrator is often used in design (web, and ui), because of how it can output resolution independent graphics easily for the specific target (retina vs non-retina output easily).</s><s> that is why it's used for web layout sometimes.</s><s> photoshop has all the editing capabilities a designer could want.</s><s> the path adobe has is perfectly fine in my book.</s><s> they realize pushing pixels (or vectors) around to build a design is much more flexible and non-restrictive than pushing grids around.</s><s> a new application would basically do the same thing.</s><s> then we can push our design into reflow, and that works beautifully.</s><s> and reflow is not a deadend.</s><s> i suppose i need to record a tutorial.</s><s> i just thought the video was pretty descriptive, and my video would basically be a replica of that one. 
i don't want another package.</s><s> i find that photoshop works beautifully for what i want, and adding another design product to the group would be unnecessary.</s><s> for webdesign what you need is a drawing tool, and a image manipulation tool.</s><s> then reflow which helps with layout, and brackets for fleshing out the code.

<s>good question!</s><s> our intention, as of now, is for reflow to be for designers to create and share responsive designs.</s><s> because reflow's design surface is the webkit browser, and because reflow's designs are created in css and html, the designer can be confident that their design can translate to the web (as opposed to a pixel perfect design done solely in photoshop, for example, which may require significant adjustment to adapt the design to the web/browser). 
</s><s>exporting production code and allowing round-trip editing (such as editing the preview in dw or edge code then pulling it back into reflow) are areas that we've considered on the team, as well as heard several requests from users (such as your feedback on this thread).</s><s> we also recognize that this functionality would move the scope and direction of reflow from being focused on design and sharing that design to being more of a website creation tool.</s><s> that might be a reasonable direction to take reflow, but it may also dilute how effective reflow is at meeting the needs of the original target user.</s><s> that also opens up questions around the code reflow would create and how reflow would handle custom html/css/javascript/server code, etc that a user could introduce in edge code or other external tools. 
</s><s>getting feedback from users like yourself is why we did this early public preview - sounds like you would find reflow most valuable for your workflow if it allowed for round-trip editing.</s><s> can you explain more about your workflow?</s><s> what tools do you use?</s><s> do you work with other members of a team, such as another designer or developer?</s><s> or do you do the design and code all yourself?

<s>i am not sure about what you mean with regards to layering.</s><s> reflow allows you to draw boxes, text and add images.</s><s> any of these elements can be placed as children of other boxes.</s><s> so, you can draw box1, box2 and box3 and make box2 and box3 children of box1 by dragging box2 and box3 inside of box1. 
</s><s>if you would like boxes to overlap, you will need to change the box's "position" property (found in the layout tab, advanced panel) to be absolute.</s><s> then, you can have boxes overlap.</s><s> once these boxes are absolute positioned, you can also edit their z-index to show which one should be layered on top of the other.

</s><s>about dreamweaver, i've been a faithful user for years but now it's definitely old for some uses.</s><s> just to say, if i open the responsive page i just created in reflow with dwcc in live view, something basic as background gradients are completely missing.</s><s> well, i'm not going to use it for this kind of work.</s><s> do you know for what dw is still a great tool?</s><s> email newsletters, since they still have to respect old standards that no one else uses anymore. 
</s><s>for all the rest i definitely prefer the editor/ide way: sublimetext and other tools.</s><s> they're faster, more apt to the task and, similarly to the adobe edge line of products, made with the same technologies they help to work with.</s><s> in the future, who knows...</s><s> maybe, you should put in development a "dreamweaver edge" version and drop the old one, a little clunky even if recently revarnished ;-)

<s>i'm a hybrid designer (at least a wannabe) and developer (heavy coder).</s><s> the best workflow i've developed at this point is: 
design layout, etc. in illustrator export illustrator as a psd (layers and text are preserved, with minimal extra empty layers) generate the reflow file in photoshop design the responsive pages in reflow, html is auto-generated (the html and images generated are pretty clean) design forms, add js and server-side code to the project (keep the js in a separate file to minimize work involved in design changes, re-generating files, etc.</s><s>) 
</s><s>the problems with this workflow are: step 2 is extraneous, and if you modify the original layout in illustrator, you must do it again i would prefer to only use photoshop in the mix when dealing with photos or complicated masks or something a little more control in reflow over file naming of the generated html, css and javascript files would facilitate a non-destructive workflow when linking and exporting between the different apps.</s><s> adobe "app juggling" has been a long running problem for me.</s><s> on my 13" macbook pro, resources are a bit limited, and running illustrator, photoshop, reflow and dreamweaver at the same time doesn't leave an adequate resource pool available.</s><s> perhaps a reflow extension for illustrator could prove more synergistic liquid layout design possibilities. 
</s><s>my motivation for using (read paying for) adobe products is improving the speed of website design and development.</s><s> before i discovered the cc updates, i was honestly ready to give up the subscription.</s><s> the cc updates to dreamweaver made it possible to consider it for coding use (cs versions didn't even honor the os x go-to-end-of-line keystroke).</s><s> cs6 saw the removal of a complete 'save for web' feature from illustrator, and it becomes time consuming to go and copy the generated html from the preview.</s><s> reflow seems like a step in the right direction for generating html and css that honors the designs as actually seen in the design app without a lot of extra, unnecessary steps (creating and managing slices and re-typing text, pasting code snippets here and there to assebmble pages). 
i definitely welcome any suggestions on the workflow!

<s>from everything i've been able to search - on workflow - there is no clear-cut easy step to prototype what you want in reflow and dump that css or html (preview) somewhere, where you can tweak later.

<s>i'm a hybrid designer (at least a wannabe) and developer (heavy coder).</s><s> the best workflow i've developed at this point is: 
design layout, etc. in illustrator export illustrator as a psd (layers and text are preserved, with minimal extra empty layers) generate the reflow file in photoshop design the responsive pages in reflow, html is auto-generated (the html and images generated are pretty clean) design forms, add js and server-side code to the project (keep the js in a separate file to minimize work involved in design changes, re-generating files, etc.</s><s>) 
</s><s>the problems with this workflow are: step 2 is extraneous, and if you modify the original layout in illustrator, you must do it again i would prefer to only use photoshop in the mix when dealing with photos or complicated masks or something a little more control in reflow over file naming of the generated html, css and javascript files would facilitate a non-destructive workflow when linking and exporting between the different apps.</s><s> adobe "app juggling" has been a long running problem for me.</s><s> on my 13" macbook pro, resources are a bit limited, and running illustrator, photoshop, reflow and dreamweaver at the same time doesn't leave an adequate resource pool available.</s><s> perhaps a reflow extension for illustrator could prove more synergistic liquid layout design possibilities. 
</s><s>my motivation for using (read paying for) adobe products is improving the speed of website design and development.</s><s> before i discovered the cc updates, i was honestly ready to give up the subscription.</s><s> the cc updates to dreamweaver made it possible to consider it for coding use (cs versions didn't even honor the os x go-to-end-of-line keystroke).</s><s> cs6 saw the removal of a complete 'save for web' feature from illustrator, and it becomes time consuming to go and copy the generated html from the preview.</s><s> reflow seems like a step in the right direction for generating html and css that honors the designs as actually seen in the design app without a lot of extra, unnecessary steps (creating and managing slices and re-typing text, pasting code snippets here and there to assebmble pages). 
i definitely welcome any suggestions on the workflow!

<s>hi :
