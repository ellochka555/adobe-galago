<s>hi kanade, 
</s><s>i have been experiencing this issue myself for a few weeks on my pc, and generally ripping my hair out over not being able to see videos scaled properly - an absolute hassle for watching diablo iii streams on twitch.tv, so you're not alone!</s><s> everything from switching browsers, deleting browser caches, and deleting and re-downloading far too many browser plugins to count. 
</s><s>however, i've seemed to have found a temporary solution, and i would like you to double check this for me - could you disable hardware acceleration on your version of flash player?</s><s> you can do this by right-clicking any flash video (for convenience, just any flash video will do), and click on the 'settings...' dialog.</s><s> from there, you just uncheck the 'enable hardware acceleration' box from the first tab, and then close the dialog and refresh the page/browser. 
</s><s>for me, it seems to have solved the issue and videos now scale correctly, and i would like to hear if it solves your problems too.</s><s> i will endevour to take a couple of screenshots so chris campbell can pass this on to the right people!

</s><s>i have been experiencing this issue myself for a few weeks on my pc, and generally ripping my hair out over not being able to see videos scaled properly - an absolute hassle for watching diablo iii streams on twitch.tv, so you're not alone!</s><s> everything from switching browsers, deleting browser caches, and deleting and re-downloading far too many browser plugins to count. 
</s><s>however, i've seemed to have found a temporary solution, and i would like you to double check this for me - could you disable hardware acceleration on your version of flash player?</s><s> you can do this by right-clicking any flash video (for convenience, just any flash video will do), and click on the 'settings...' dialog.</s><s> from there, you just uncheck the 'enable hardware acceleration' box from the first tab, and then close the dialog and refresh the page/browser. 
</s><s>for me, it seems to have solved the issue and videos now scale correctly, and i would like to hear if it solves your problems too.</s><s> i will endevour to take a couple of screenshots so chris campbell can pass this on to the right people!

<s>hi tomasz77, here is what you need to check.</s><s> using ie, go to tools, click on manage add ons.</s><s> find a listing that says shockwave flash object...activex control....flash10e.ocx(if vs 10.0.45.2) flash10d.ocx (if vs 10.0.42.34).</s><s> i am not sure if you can do this with ie8 or not.</s><s> i know with ie6 you can.</s><s> try it anyway.</s><s> click on shockwave flash object and see if there is on the bottom right a box that says "update activex".</s><s> if it does, click on it and see if it updates.</s><s> a small window with a graph will run.</s><s> when it is finished, reboot your computer.</s><s> in ie6 this updates that activex, whether it will or not with ie, you'll know.</s><s> if it doesn't then we need to take a look at the flash player files. 
</s><s>one other thing on this shockwave flash object.</s><s> in your post#1, you said you "deactivated" it after you became suspicious.</s><s> now anytime there is an uninstall or install of any program or like flash player, one must always reboot for the changes to take effect.</s><s> by "deactivating" this i think that stopped the process.</s><s> if the above trying to update the swo does not work, make sure it is enabled and then reboot(restart) your computer, before checking the flash files below.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, ie8 is restrictive so that is why you couldn't update the activex.

no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>hi verdy, well clearly this is not coming from adobe.</s><s> everyday the bad guys are at work and the anti-virus programs are constantly updating to battle this.</s><s> i don't see what adobe could do to combat spam.

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here.

i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>)

i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack. 
(we will still have to live with social engineering, but this is manageable.</s><s> i cannot easily manage automated scripts that run without any explicit user action, like here).

<s>i can't call their phone line for that, and anyway i don't think that microsoft is involved in this case, even if this occurs on windows 7 (not xp as you have assumed above): i don't use ie (which is not installed at all) but google chrome (i've mostly abandoned firefox, which is too much risky in most of its numerous addons, and i much prefer a simpler browser with less dependencies and liabilities).</s><s> flashplayer is supported indirectly by google too (but google still does not detect this threat).

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer.

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>)

</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<subject>how to avoid forced downloads via Flash in webmail?</subject>
<post author="verdy_p" timestamp="Feb 22, 2010 9:23 AM">
<s>i now receive a lot of spams formated in html and referencing a malicious flash object, supposed to display a video that does not run, but still that activates an immediate download of a malicious .</s><s>exe file (a worm) downloaded from the same site as the video. 
</s><s>why does just a preview of the html message in my webmail not only shows the malicious video component to render it in the stop state (i don't click anywhere in the message), but that also immediately activates its internal javascript that immediately starts a download and opens a new browser window? 
i did not find any solution for this problem; as it now forbids me just previewing messages before deleting them, i will soon have to drop flash completely. 
</s><s>downloading a file should not be authorized by default in flash, without a user action initiating it, notably when the component comes from another domain than the zone of the displayed html message (which is anyway in the same zone for potentially dangerous sites). 
</s><s>i've setup flash to use the maximum security settings, this does not work.</s><s> those pesky spams will kill flsh compeltely for me. 
</s><s>please adobe find a solution, where i can forbid any flash component loaded from an unsecured zone to use a download to local disk, and the only interaction possible is only to load the swf and initiate it in a non active state where it will just display the first static image of the video and no script will be activated befire an explicit user action. 
</s><s>for flash, the only user action that launches the download is a simple mousehover.</s><s> this is really not enough, because the swf covers the whole surface of the webmail (whose title is for now "holaaaa!", and displays a flash video component showing a hispanic woman laughing). 
</s><s>i've not been able to record a safe copy of this spam without activating it partly.</s><s> this swf absolutely wants to force the download of "flashplayer10.0.45.2.exe" which is not the original from adobe and is infected, it also tries to download other files, but as i block the first one, the remaining files won't appear. 

i really think that this is a huge security hole in flash, which is already exploited, now massively via spams (i receive copies of these spams referencing this worm-swf about 5 or 6 times a day, and this number is growing, the content shows some text in spanish, but this does not matter). 

</s><s>the html content of the spams just contains this malicious flash: 

<embed height="360" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="634" src="http://www.users.qwest.net/~benpeg72/secure/wanadoo.swf"> 

(various urls are used for the same flash object, from all around the world on lots of domains and in lots of user web spaces or blogs allowing flash videos, this one may already be blocked, when you'll read this message). 

</s><s>please investigate.

<s>yes i received it in a html mail just cointaining this <embed> element that will be redered by flash. 
</s><s>the problem is that flash when it is loaded in an unsafe web zone (such as an email), will automatically enable the mousehover event. 
</s><s>if you're reading your mails online on a webmail, even in the safest "preview" mode, it will still allow showing the first frame and the gui of the video component, but also it will enable the mousehover event, which will be raised almost immediately as soon as you open the preview (the flash component covers almost all the screen, there's a big chance that the mouse cursor will be within the area covered by the component when the preview gets open, so a mousehover event occurs immedaitely that activates the malicious javascript in the swf file. 
i absolutely don't know how flash can be restricted more by detecting a cross-zone or cross-domain scripting security issue here: can the locally installed embedded plugin, loaded from an unsecure zone or from a webpage served by the webmail service, detect that the referenced swf is in fact loaded from another unrelated domain, so that it should be rendered also as unsecure, with all user interactions disabled before there's an explicit click ? 
a mousehover is not enough.</s><s> in an unsafe environment, only an explicit click should be allowed (so "onmouseclick" could be enabled to activate the flash object, but "onmousehover" should not be honored.</s><s>) 
</s><s>what is worse id that the component can also immediately start an active download to local disk, which by default is the default download folder where you typically download your flash player installers (so this swf will attempt to overwrite the existing local copy of the original adobe flash player installer.</s><s> it will also attempt to download some other scripts that will force running this bad installer.</s><s> it also immedateily opens a new browser window that will attempt to download and run other files in the local zone. 
</s><s>i've never seen such use of flash within emails before, that allowed it to run this way.</s><s> i think this is a new securty hole, and a new exploit: someting is probably wrong in the flash security settings (a door supposed to be closed can be opened by the javascript within an external swf file). 
</s><s>i've reported all these spammy worms as spams to my webmail provider, but they still continue to reach my mailbox, at an increasing rate from all around the world.</s><s> this suggests that the worm is very successful in its infection, and so there's really a security issue that is not covered anywhere. 
</s><s>none of my antivirus and antispywares are detecting this worm (and none of my antispam filters are detecting it either): it is possibly using mutable code with encryption to hide the effects of its embedded malicious flash-javascript.

<s>yes, this swf is a downloader, and it can use any kind of virus (it already does in addition to downloading a "new" flashplayer from unknown source).</s><s> the bad thing is that the swf downloader can effectively bypass the flashplayer 10 security setting (no click required, a simple preview is enough, and the mouseover even is honored to launch the downloads before the antipopup (built in the browser) can even detect it.</s><s> one good antimeasure is to make sure that the browser will always ask for the storage location of the newly downloaded files, so that you can cancel it. don't allow it to proceed immediately using the default download folder of the browser (because we still have the "save as..." confirmation dialog).</s><s> but i fear that it will be possible for a swf downloader to bypass even this "save as..." dialog by providing a working location (if it can get access to the name of the user's home folder, something that will be easier than guessing the randomized folder name used by the browser's cache, or by the flashplayer cache) 
</s><s>note also that if uac is disabled, and the user is using a administrator account, the swf downloader could also try to download directly in c:\windows or in c:\, but another accessible location is c:\windows\temp; for this reason, i have not named the windows folder c:\windows, and i have created another c:\windows folder with all permisions denied to everyone, including the "system" account: i can read from it but can't even delete it myself or write anythin there, except after booting in "safe mode" and logging in with a specific account using a key stored on a separate cdrom with various administration tools : even a live boot cd will not be able to write there). 
</s><s>given that i've not allowed to download the fake plash player that the swf wants to save, i absolutely don't know if its an original, or what it contains or which effects it can do (the descriptions for both files are still incomplete in the websites of the security centers i have contacted and that have built detections or counter-measures for their security tools).

</s><s>i've setup flash to use the maximum security settings, this does not work.</s><s> those pesky spams will kill flsh compeltely for me. 
</s><s>please adobe find a solution, where i can forbid any flash component loaded from an unsecured zone to use a download to local disk, and the only interaction possible is only to load the swf and initiate it in a non active state where it will just display the first static image of the video and no script will be activated befire an explicit user action. 
</s><s>for flash, the only user action that launches the download is a simple mousehover.</s><s> this is really not enough, because the swf covers the whole surface of the webmail (whose title is for now "holaaaa!", and displays a flash video component showing a hispanic woman laughing). 
</s><s>i've not been able to record a safe copy of this spam without activating it partly.</s><s> this swf absolutely wants to force the download of "flashplayer10.0.45.2.exe" which is not the original from adobe and is infected, it also tries to download other files, but as i block the first one, the remaining files won't appear. 

i really think that this is a huge security hole in flash, which is already exploited, now massively via spams (i receive copies of these spams referencing this worm-swf about 5 or 6 times a day, and this number is growing, the content shows some text in spanish, but this does not matter). 

</s><s>the html content of the spams just contains this malicious flash: 

<embed height="360" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="634" src="http://www.users.qwest.net/~benpeg72/secure/wanadoo.swf"> 

(various urls are used for the same flash object, from all around the world on lots of domains and in lots of user web spaces or blogs allowing flash videos, this one may already be blocked, when you'll read this message). 

</s><s>please investigate.

thanks for posting also in my thread to alert me.

<s>yes i received it in a html mail just cointaining this <embed> element that will be redered by flash. 
</s><s>the problem is that flash when it is loaded in an unsafe web zone (such as an email), will automatically enable the mousehover event. 
</s><s>if you're reading your mails online on a webmail, even in the safest "preview" mode, it will still allow showing the first frame and the gui of the video component, but also it will enable the mousehover event, which will be raised almost immediately as soon as you open the preview (the flash component covers almost all the screen, there's a big chance that the mouse cursor will be within the area covered by the component when the preview gets open, so a mousehover event occurs immedaitely that activates the malicious javascript in the swf file. 
i absolutely don't know how flash can be restricted more by detecting a cross-zone or cross-domain scripting security issue here: can the locally installed embedded plugin, loaded from an unsecure zone or from a webpage served by the webmail service, detect that the referenced swf is in fact loaded from another unrelated domain, so that it should be rendered also as unsecure, with all user interactions disabled before there's an explicit click ? 
a mousehover is not enough.</s><s> in an unsafe environment, only an explicit click should be allowed (so "onmouseclick" could be enabled to activate the flash object, but "onmousehover" should not be honored.</s><s>) 
</s><s>what is worse id that the component can also immediately start an active download to local disk, which by default is the default download folder where you typically download your flash player installers (so this swf will attempt to overwrite the existing local copy of the original adobe flash player installer.</s><s> it will also attempt to download some other scripts that will force running this bad installer.</s><s> it also immedateily opens a new browser window that will attempt to download and run other files in the local zone. 
</s><s>i've never seen such use of flash within emails before, that allowed it to run this way.</s><s> i think this is a new securty hole, and a new exploit: someting is probably wrong in the flash security settings (a door supposed to be closed can be opened by the javascript within an external swf file). 
</s><s>i've reported all these spammy worms as spams to my webmail provider, but they still continue to reach my mailbox, at an increasing rate from all around the world.</s><s> this suggests that the worm is very successful in its infection, and so there's really a security issue that is not covered anywhere. 
</s><s>none of my antivirus and antispywares are detecting this worm (and none of my antispam filters are detecting it either): it is possibly using mutable code with encryption to hide the effects of its embedded malicious flash-javascript.

<s>yes, this swf is a downloader, and it can use any kind of virus (it already does in addition to downloading a "new" flashplayer from unknown source).</s><s> the bad thing is that the swf downloader can effectively bypass the flashplayer 10 security setting (no click required, a simple preview is enough, and the mouseover even is honored to launch the downloads before the antipopup (built in the browser) can even detect it.</s><s> one good antimeasure is to make sure that the browser will always ask for the storage location of the newly downloaded files, so that you can cancel it. don't allow it to proceed immediately using the default download folder of the browser (because we still have the "save as..." confirmation dialog).</s><s> but i fear that it will be possible for a swf downloader to bypass even this "save as..." dialog by providing a working location (if it can get access to the name of the user's home folder, something that will be easier than guessing the randomized folder name used by the browser's cache, or by the flashplayer cache) 
</s><s>note also that if uac is disabled, and the user is using a administrator account, the swf downloader could also try to download directly in c:\windows or in c:\, but another accessible location is c:\windows\temp; for this reason, i have not named the windows folder c:\windows, and i have created another c:\windows folder with all permisions denied to everyone, including the "system" account: i can read from it but can't even delete it myself or write anythin there, except after booting in "safe mode" and logging in with a specific account using a key stored on a separate cdrom with various administration tools : even a live boot cd will not be able to write there). 
</s><s>given that i've not allowed to download the fake plash player that the swf wants to save, i absolutely don't know if its an original, or what it contains or which effects it can do (the descriptions for both files are still incomplete in the websites of the security centers i have contacted and that have built detections or counter-measures for their security tools).

it definitely isnt my computer or connection as i have successfully downloaded stuff like files from another forum, other utility applications from filehippo.com, and even the uninstaller from the link you gave, all downloaded fine.</s><s> i just cant seem to access the flashplayer download site. and i went to the older versions page from adobe and flash player 9 wouldnt download either. 
now im stuck without any flash player at all!</s><s>! =( please help me as i really feel crippled when i cant visit so many sites that all use flashplayer 
here are some other things i have tried or some info i can provide: -using windows xp and ie 7 latest version. -using a different browser, firefox, but same problem exists -reset my modem connection but same problem exists -also tried the subinacl.exe fix provided in the troubleshooting page but same problem exists

<s>arp man, 
</s><s>there are quite a number of reasons and possibilities why flash player may not install successfully on certain systems.</s><s> they include incorrectly uninstalled earlier versions, registry permissions, browser settings, and many others. 
</s><s>the reason why i first often recommend a full uninstall, followed by an offline install, is that it has resolved some 90% of all cases in the past.</s><s> in the other 10% we can try other things, but in some rare cases things will remain unsolved.</s><s> but it's not millions of cases; probably not even hundreds. 
</s><s>in the case of the original poster of this topic, as well as with yourself, there is not much i or anyone else can do because we have no information about your environment, i.e. operating system or browser.

<s>hello pat willener.</s><s> a few weeks ago, when i first experienced my still unresolved flash player problem, i went to this forum to hopefully seek an end to my dilemmma.</s><s> i saw your name as the "top participant," and, due to the number of your posts, i thought you were perhaps an adobe employee and/or someone who is very knowledgable regarding adobe products.</s><s> i spent hours on this forum, and i attempted every suggestion of your's that i could find on this forum.</s><s> not one of them worked.</s><s> i tried the uninstall/install numerous times along with a myriad of other things.</s><s> i started to wonder if you were some type of joker who gets his kicks out of giving people advice that doesn't work.</s><s> if you go back and read my initial post, i never asked you to stop posting on this forum.</s><s> what i wrote was, if you're going to give advice, please give advice that is meaningful, advice that works.</s><s> surely you must have seen some of the thousands of posts out there (on this forum and others) in which people indicated that the unintall/install manoeuver doesn't work.</s><s> my intial post to you was out of frustration because i thought that you were sending more people on a wild goose chase.</s><s> i apologize for this; i do believe that you are only trying to help.</s><s> however, i am convinced, as are many others, that the only thing that is going to fix this huge problem with flash player is for adobe to find the root cause of the problem and correct it with another version of flash player.</s><s> this is why i encourage adobe employees to get in on these posts and let people know what if anything adobe is doing to fix this problem.</s><s> so far, adobe employees have been (far too) silent on this issue.

<s>arp man, 
</s><s>there are quite a number of reasons and possibilities why flash player may not install successfully on certain systems.</s><s> they include incorrectly uninstalled earlier versions, registry permissions, browser settings, and many others.

</s><s>i just tried the link that you provided that allowed the adobe installer to be saved to a file and i saved it to my desk top.</s><s> unfortunately it still wouldn't download the flash player, i received the same message which reference tech note 19166.</s><s> i have tried the suggested fixes provided by adobe and none have worked so far.</s><s> i will admit that the more technicle ones i'm unsure about and i haven't tried them for fear of doing something wrong.</s><s> i will say that i'm starting to think that it may have something to do with my system registry and that based on things that i have read. 
i am using xp professional 2002, service pack 3 and ie 8.</s><s> i will add that i have also read something that indicated there may be a conflict between the ie8 and the adobe flash player.</s><s> all in all i am very frustrated and am running out of things to try. 
i do have one question.</s><s> does anyone have an opinion about these software products that i've seen claiming it can clean and fix the pc registry?</s><s> my only concern there is that it may just be an elablorate effort to sell a product or to rip off one's personal information. 
</s><s>any comments or other suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 
thanks, ellen

<s>hi kanade, 
</s><s>i have been experiencing this issue myself for a few weeks on my pc, and generally ripping my hair out over not being able to see videos scaled properly - an absolute hassle for watching diablo iii streams on twitch.tv, so you're not alone!</s><s> everything from switching browsers, deleting browser caches, and deleting and re-downloading far too many browser plugins to count. 
</s><s>however, i've seemed to have found a temporary solution, and i would like you to double check this for me - could you disable hardware acceleration on your version of flash player?</s><s> you can do this by right-clicking any flash video (for convenience, just any flash video will do), and click on the 'settings...' dialog.</s><s> from there, you just uncheck the 'enable hardware acceleration' box from the first tab, and then close the dialog and refresh the page/browser. 
</s><s>for me, it seems to have solved the issue and videos now scale correctly, and i would like to hear if it solves your problems too.</s><s> i will endevour to take a couple of screenshots so chris campbell can pass this on to the right people!

<s>hi kanade, 
</s><s>i have been experiencing this issue myself for a few weeks on my pc, and generally ripping my hair out over not being able to see videos scaled properly - an absolute hassle for watching diablo iii streams on twitch.tv, so you're not alone!</s><s> everything from switching browsers, deleting browser caches, and deleting and re-downloading far too many browser plugins to count. 
</s><s>however, i've seemed to have found a temporary solution, and i would like you to double check this for me - could you disable hardware acceleration on your version of flash player?</s><s> you can do this by right-clicking any flash video (for convenience, just any flash video will do), and click on the 'settings...' dialog.</s><s> from there, you just uncheck the 'enable hardware acceleration' box from the first tab, and then close the dialog and refresh the page/browser. 
</s><s>for me, it seems to have solved the issue and videos now scale correctly, and i would like to hear if it solves your problems too.</s><s> i will endevour to take a couple of screenshots so chris campbell can pass this on to the right people!

</s><s>i have been experiencing this issue myself for a few weeks on my pc, and generally ripping my hair out over not being able to see videos scaled properly - an absolute hassle for watching diablo iii streams on twitch.tv, so you're not alone!</s><s> everything from switching browsers, deleting browser caches, and deleting and re-downloading far too many browser plugins to count. 
</s><s>however, i've seemed to have found a temporary solution, and i would like you to double check this for me - could you disable hardware acceleration on your version of flash player?</s><s> you can do this by right-clicking any flash video (for convenience, just any flash video will do), and click on the 'settings...' dialog.</s><s> from there, you just uncheck the 'enable hardware acceleration' box from the first tab, and then close the dialog and refresh the page/browser. 
</s><s>for me, it seems to have solved the issue and videos now scale correctly, and i would like to hear if it solves your problems too.</s><s> i will endevour to take a couple of screenshots so chris campbell can pass this on to the right people!

<s>hi kanade, 
</s><s>i have been experiencing this issue myself for a few weeks on my pc, and generally ripping my hair out over not being able to see videos scaled properly - an absolute hassle for watching diablo iii streams on twitch.tv, so you're not alone!</s><s> everything from switching browsers, deleting browser caches, and deleting and re-downloading far too many browser plugins to count. 
</s><s>however, i've seemed to have found a temporary solution, and i would like you to double check this for me - could you disable hardware acceleration on your version of flash player?</s><s> you can do this by right-clicking any flash video (for convenience, just any flash video will do), and click on the 'settings...' dialog.</s><s> from there, you just uncheck the 'enable hardware acceleration' box from the first tab, and then close the dialog and refresh the page/browser. 
</s><s>for me, it seems to have solved the issue and videos now scale correctly, and i would like to hear if it solves your problems too.</s><s> i will endevour to take a couple of screenshots so chris campbell can pass this on to the right people!

<s>hi kanade, 
</s><s>i have been experiencing this issue myself for a few weeks on my pc, and generally ripping my hair out over not being able to see videos scaled properly - an absolute hassle for watching diablo iii streams on twitch.tv, so you're not alone!</s><s> everything from switching browsers, deleting browser caches, and deleting and re-downloading far too many browser plugins to count. 
</s><s>however, i've seemed to have found a temporary solution, and i would like you to double check this for me - could you disable hardware acceleration on your version of flash player?</s><s> you can do this by right-clicking any flash video (for convenience, just any flash video will do), and click on the 'settings...' dialog.</s><s> from there, you just uncheck the 'enable hardware acceleration' box from the first tab, and then close the dialog and refresh the page/browser. 
</s><s>for me, it seems to have solved the issue and videos now scale correctly, and i would like to hear if it solves your problems too.</s><s> i will endevour to take a couple of screenshots so chris campbell can pass this on to the right people!

<s>hi kanade, 
</s><s>i have been experiencing this issue myself for a few weeks on my pc, and generally ripping my hair out over not being able to see videos scaled properly - an absolute hassle for watching diablo iii streams on twitch.tv, so you're not alone!</s><s> everything from switching browsers, deleting browser caches, and deleting and re-downloading far too many browser plugins to count. 
</s><s>however, i've seemed to have found a temporary solution, and i would like you to double check this for me - could you disable hardware acceleration on your version of flash player?</s><s> you can do this by right-clicking any flash video (for convenience, just any flash video will do), and click on the 'settings...' dialog.</s><s> from there, you just uncheck the 'enable hardware acceleration' box from the first tab, and then close the dialog and refresh the page/browser. 
</s><s>for me, it seems to have solved the issue and videos now scale correctly, and i would like to hear if it solves your problems too.</s><s> i will endevour to take a couple of screenshots so chris campbell can pass this on to the right people!

<s>hi kanade, 
</s><s>i have been experiencing this issue myself for a few weeks on my pc, and generally ripping my hair out over not being able to see videos scaled properly - an absolute hassle for watching diablo iii streams on twitch.tv, so you're not alone!</s><s> everything from switching browsers, deleting browser caches, and deleting and re-downloading far too many browser plugins to count. 
</s><s>however, i've seemed to have found a temporary solution, and i would like you to double check this for me - could you disable hardware acceleration on your version of flash player?</s><s> you can do this by right-clicking any flash video (for convenience, just any flash video will do), and click on the 'settings...' dialog.</s><s> from there, you just uncheck the 'enable hardware acceleration' box from the first tab, and then close the dialog and refresh the page/browser. 
</s><s>for me, it seems to have solved the issue and videos now scale correctly, and i would like to hear if it solves your problems too.</s><s> i will endevour to take a couple of screenshots so chris campbell can pass this on to the right people!

<s>hi kanade, 
</s><s>i have been experiencing this issue myself for a few weeks on my pc, and generally ripping my hair out over not being able to see videos scaled properly - an absolute hassle for watching diablo iii streams on twitch.tv, so you're not alone!</s><s> everything from switching browsers, deleting browser caches, and deleting and re-downloading far too many browser plugins to count. 
</s><s>however, i've seemed to have found a temporary solution, and i would like you to double check this for me - could you disable hardware acceleration on your version of flash player?</s><s> you can do this by right-clicking any flash video (for convenience, just any flash video will do), and click on the 'settings...' dialog.</s><s> from there, you just uncheck the 'enable hardware acceleration' box from the first tab, and then close the dialog and refresh the page/browser. 
</s><s>for me, it seems to have solved the issue and videos now scale correctly, and i would like to hear if it solves your problems too.</s><s> i will endevour to take a couple of screenshots so chris campbell can pass this on to the right people!

</s><s>however, i've seemed to have found a temporary solution, and i would like you to double check this for me - could you disable hardware acceleration on your version of flash player?</s><s> you can do this by right-clicking any flash video (for convenience, just any flash video will do), and click on the 'settings...' dialog.</s><s> from there, you just uncheck the 'enable hardware acceleration' box from the first tab, and then close the dialog and refresh the page/browser. 
</s><s>for me, it seems to have solved the issue and videos now scale correctly, and i would like to hear if it solves your problems too.</s><s> i will endevour to take a couple of screenshots so chris campbell can pass this on to the right people!

</s><s>however, i've seemed to have found a temporary solution, and i would like you to double check this for me - could you disable hardware acceleration on your version of flash player?</s><s> you can do this by right-clicking any flash video (for convenience, just any flash video will do), and click on the 'settings...' dialog.</s><s> from there, you just uncheck the 'enable hardware acceleration' box from the first tab, and then close the dialog and refresh the page/browser. 
</s><s>for me, it seems to have solved the issue and videos now scale correctly, and i would like to hear if it solves your problems too.</s><s> i will endevour to take a couple of screenshots so chris campbell can pass this on to the right people!

<s>hi kanade, 
</s><s>i have been experiencing this issue myself for a few weeks on my pc, and generally ripping my hair out over not being able to see videos scaled properly - an absolute hassle for watching diablo iii streams on twitch.tv, so you're not alone!</s><s> everything from switching browsers, deleting browser caches, and deleting and re-downloading far too many browser plugins to count. 
</s><s>however, i've seemed to have found a temporary solution, and i would like you to double check this for me - could you disable hardware acceleration on your version of flash player?</s><s> you can do this by right-clicking any flash video (for convenience, just any flash video will do), and click on the 'settings...' dialog.</s><s> from there, you just uncheck the 'enable hardware acceleration' box from the first tab, and then close the dialog and refresh the page/browser. 
</s><s>for me, it seems to have solved the issue and videos now scale correctly, and i would like to hear if it solves your problems too.</s><s> i will endevour to take a couple of screenshots so chris campbell can pass this on to the right people!

<s>hi kanade, 
</s><s>i have been experiencing this issue myself for a few weeks on my pc, and generally ripping my hair out over not being able to see videos scaled properly - an absolute hassle for watching diablo iii streams on twitch.tv, so you're not alone!</s><s> everything from switching browsers, deleting browser caches, and deleting and re-downloading far too many browser plugins to count. 
</s><s>however, i've seemed to have found a temporary solution, and i would like you to double check this for me - could you disable hardware acceleration on your version of flash player?</s><s> you can do this by right-clicking any flash video (for convenience, just any flash video will do), and click on the 'settings...' dialog.</s><s> from there, you just uncheck the 'enable hardware acceleration' box from the first tab, and then close the dialog and refresh the page/browser. 
</s><s>for me, it seems to have solved the issue and videos now scale correctly, and i would like to hear if it solves your problems too.</s><s> i will endevour to take a couple of screenshots so chris campbell can pass this on to the right people!

<s>hi kanade, 
</s><s>i have been experiencing this issue myself for a few weeks on my pc, and generally ripping my hair out over not being able to see videos scaled properly - an absolute hassle for watching diablo iii streams on twitch.tv, so you're not alone!</s><s> everything from switching browsers, deleting browser caches, and deleting and re-downloading far too many browser plugins to count. 
</s><s>however, i've seemed to have found a temporary solution, and i would like you to double check this for me - could you disable hardware acceleration on your version of flash player?</s><s> you can do this by right-clicking any flash video (for convenience, just any flash video will do), and click on the 'settings...' dialog.</s><s> from there, you just uncheck the 'enable hardware acceleration' box from the first tab, and then close the dialog and refresh the page/browser. 
</s><s>for me, it seems to have solved the issue and videos now scale correctly, and i would like to hear if it solves your problems too.</s><s> i will endevour to take a couple of screenshots so chris campbell can pass this on to the right people!

</s><s>however, i've seemed to have found a temporary solution, and i would like you to double check this for me - could you disable hardware acceleration on your version of flash player?</s><s> you can do this by right-clicking any flash video (for convenience, just any flash video will do), and click on the 'settings...' dialog.</s><s> from there, you just uncheck the 'enable hardware acceleration' box from the first tab, and then close the dialog and refresh the page/browser. 
</s><s>for me, it seems to have solved the issue and videos now scale correctly, and i would like to hear if it solves your problems too.</s><s> i will endevour to take a couple of screenshots so chris campbell can pass this on to the right people!

</s><s>however, i've seemed to have found a temporary solution, and i would like you to double check this for me - could you disable hardware acceleration on your version of flash player?</s><s> you can do this by right-clicking any flash video (for convenience, just any flash video will do), and click on the 'settings...' dialog.</s><s> from there, you just uncheck the 'enable hardware acceleration' box from the first tab, and then close the dialog and refresh the page/browser. 
</s><s>for me, it seems to have solved the issue and videos now scale correctly, and i would like to hear if it solves your problems too.</s><s> i will endevour to take a couple of screenshots so chris campbell can pass this on to the right people!

</s><s>i have been experiencing this issue myself for a few weeks on my pc, and generally ripping my hair out over not being able to see videos scaled properly - an absolute hassle for watching diablo iii streams on twitch.tv, so you're not alone!</s><s> everything from switching browsers, deleting browser caches, and deleting and re-downloading far too many browser plugins to count. 
</s><s>however, i've seemed to have found a temporary solution, and i would like you to double check this for me - could you disable hardware acceleration on your version of flash player?</s><s> you can do this by right-clicking any flash video (for convenience, just any flash video will do), and click on the 'settings...' dialog.</s><s> from there, you just uncheck the 'enable hardware acceleration' box from the first tab, and then close the dialog and refresh the page/browser. 
</s><s>for me, it seems to have solved the issue and videos now scale correctly, and i would like to hear if it solves your problems too.</s><s> i will endevour to take a couple of screenshots so chris campbell can pass this on to the right people!

<s>hi kanade, 
</s><s>i have been experiencing this issue myself for a few weeks on my pc, and generally ripping my hair out over not being able to see videos scaled properly - an absolute hassle for watching diablo iii streams on twitch.tv, so you're not alone!</s><s> everything from switching browsers, deleting browser caches, and deleting and re-downloading far too many browser plugins to count. 
</s><s>however, i've seemed to have found a temporary solution, and i would like you to double check this for me - could you disable hardware acceleration on your version of flash player?</s><s> you can do this by right-clicking any flash video (for convenience, just any flash video will do), and click on the 'settings...' dialog.</s><s> from there, you just uncheck the 'enable hardware acceleration' box from the first tab, and then close the dialog and refresh the page/browser. 
</s><s>for me, it seems to have solved the issue and videos now scale correctly, and i would like to hear if it solves your problems too.</s><s> i will endevour to take a couple of screenshots so chris campbell can pass this on to the right people!

<s>hi kanade, 
</s><s>i have been experiencing this issue myself for a few weeks on my pc, and generally ripping my hair out over not being able to see videos scaled properly - an absolute hassle for watching diablo iii streams on twitch.tv, so you're not alone!</s><s> everything from switching browsers, deleting browser caches, and deleting and re-downloading far too many browser plugins to count. 
</s><s>however, i've seemed to have found a temporary solution, and i would like you to double check this for me - could you disable hardware acceleration on your version of flash player?</s><s> you can do this by right-clicking any flash video (for convenience, just any flash video will do), and click on the 'settings...' dialog.</s><s> from there, you just uncheck the 'enable hardware acceleration' box from the first tab, and then close the dialog and refresh the page/browser. 
</s><s>for me, it seems to have solved the issue and videos now scale correctly, and i would like to hear if it solves your problems too.</s><s> i will endevour to take a couple of screenshots so chris campbell can pass this on to the right people!

<s>hi kanade, 
</s><s>i have been experiencing this issue myself for a few weeks on my pc, and generally ripping my hair out over not being able to see videos scaled properly - an absolute hassle for watching diablo iii streams on twitch.tv, so you're not alone!</s><s> everything from switching browsers, deleting browser caches, and deleting and re-downloading far too many browser plugins to count. 
</s><s>however, i've seemed to have found a temporary solution, and i would like you to double check this for me - could you disable hardware acceleration on your version of flash player?</s><s> you can do this by right-clicking any flash video (for convenience, just any flash video will do), and click on the 'settings...' dialog.</s><s> from there, you just uncheck the 'enable hardware acceleration' box from the first tab, and then close the dialog and refresh the page/browser. 
</s><s>for me, it seems to have solved the issue and videos now scale correctly, and i would like to hear if it solves your problems too.</s><s> i will endevour to take a couple of screenshots so chris campbell can pass this on to the right people!

<s>hi kanade, 
</s><s>i have been experiencing this issue myself for a few weeks on my pc, and generally ripping my hair out over not being able to see videos scaled properly - an absolute hassle for watching diablo iii streams on twitch.tv, so you're not alone!</s><s> everything from switching browsers, deleting browser caches, and deleting and re-downloading far too many browser plugins to count. 
</s><s>however, i've seemed to have found a temporary solution, and i would like you to double check this for me - could you disable hardware acceleration on your version of flash player?</s><s> you can do this by right-clicking any flash video (for convenience, just any flash video will do), and click on the 'settings...' dialog.</s><s> from there, you just uncheck the 'enable hardware acceleration' box from the first tab, and then close the dialog and refresh the page/browser. 
</s><s>for me, it seems to have solved the issue and videos now scale correctly, and i would like to hear if it solves your problems too.</s><s> i will endevour to take a couple of screenshots so chris campbell can pass this on to the right people!

</s><s>however, i've seemed to have found a temporary solution, and i would like you to double check this for me - could you disable hardware acceleration on your version of flash player?</s><s> you can do this by right-clicking any flash video (for convenience, just any flash video will do), and click on the 'settings...' dialog.</s><s> from there, you just uncheck the 'enable hardware acceleration' box from the first tab, and then close the dialog and refresh the page/browser. 
</s><s>for me, it seems to have solved the issue and videos now scale correctly, and i would like to hear if it solves your problems too.</s><s> i will endevour to take a couple of screenshots so chris campbell can pass this on to the right people!

<s>hi lubbe, thank you.</s><s> your flash player files and the swo for ie are all correct.</s><s> the npswf files for ff are the correct versions, so your flash player files for ff are correct.

use your ff browser for this.</s><s> go to start, control panel and double click on the java icon(coffee cup), click on advanced tab, double click on default java for browsers.</s><s> when this opens, make sure a check mark is entered beside microsoft internet explorer and also mozilla family.</s><s> if a check mark is missing, put one in.</s><s> clcik apply, ok and reboot your computer.</s><s> let me know what you needed to do, if anything.</s><s> now if either check mark is entered but greyed out so you cannot uncheck it i need to know this also.</s><s> now when you finish this go back and double click on the java icon and click on the version tab and find out what version is listed.(since the java test said you didn't have the latest version) perhaps the test site has a glitch.

<s>hi lubbe, thank you.</s><s> your flash player files and the swo for ie are all correct.</s><s> the npswf files for ff are the correct versions, so your flash player files for ff are correct. 
</s><s>well you have done a lot of checking and troubleshooting and clean up which is good. 
</s><s>flash player is installed correctly for ie. 
</s><s>here are a couple of things i need for you to check.</s><s> thanks for the screenshot, by the way.</s><s> however i only saw one java add on for ie. there should be more and you may have more add ons in addition to the java. 
</s><s>in ie8, i understand there is a "view & manage your internet explorer add-ons" at the bottom left is "all add-ons" with a down arrow.</s><s> i think the add ons are in categories, activex controls, run without permissions, ie all add ons, etc. 
</s><s>when the flash player is installed correctly in ie and ff, then something else is causing a problem and that is what we are trying to find out now.</s><s> you've done everything correctly and there should not be a problem. 
</s><s>just a thot, before you installed microsoft security essentials, did you remove any and all other anti-virus programs that were installed?</s><s> what was the program that you used? 
</s><s>thanks, eidnolb

<s>hi lubbe, thank you for this screenshot.</s><s> if these are the only add ons you have in ie, i don't see anything that would conflict with your browser or each other.

http://www.java.com/en click on "do i have java?", then there is another test involving jvm(java virtual machine), take that on also.</s><s> use ie first and then do the test using ff.

<s>hi lubbe, thanks for checking the java.</s><s> i'm not sure why the first test with ff indicated that.</s><s> we'll check this: 
use your ff browser for this.</s><s> go to start, control panel and double click on the java icon(coffee cup), click on advanced tab, double click on default java for browsers.</s><s> when this opens, make sure a check mark is entered beside microsoft internet explorer and also mozilla family.</s><s> if a check mark is missing, put one in.</s><s> clcik apply, ok and reboot your computer.</s><s> let me know what you needed to do, if anything.</s><s> now if either check mark is entered but greyed out so you cannot uncheck it i need to know this also.</s><s> now when you finish this go back and double click on the java icon and click on the version tab and find out what version is listed.(since the java test said you didn't have the latest version) perhaps the test site has a glitch. 




</s><s>as soon as you finish the java check above, here is what i would suggest you try. 
</s><s>with the firefox browser, go into your plug-ins and disable all of them except the swf and java.</s><s> then try your websites.

<s>hi tomasz77, here is what you need to check.</s><s> using ie, go to tools, click on manage add ons.</s><s> find a listing that says shockwave flash object...activex control....flash10e.ocx(if vs 10.0.45.2) flash10d.ocx (if vs 10.0.42.34).</s><s> i am not sure if you can do this with ie8 or not.</s><s> i know with ie6 you can.</s><s> try it anyway.</s><s> click on shockwave flash object and see if there is on the bottom right a box that says "update activex".</s><s> if it does, click on it and see if it updates.</s><s> a small window with a graph will run.</s><s> when it is finished, reboot your computer.</s><s> in ie6 this updates that activex, whether it will or not with ie, you'll know.</s><s> if it doesn't then we need to take a look at the flash player files. 
</s><s>one other thing on this shockwave flash object.</s><s> in your post#1, you said you "deactivated" it after you became suspicious.</s><s> now anytime there is an uninstall or install of any program or like flash player, one must always reboot for the changes to take effect.</s><s> by "deactivating" this i think that stopped the process.</s><s> if the above trying to update the swo does not work, make sure it is enabled and then reboot(restart) your computer, before checking the flash files below.

</s><s>since you have run several anti-virus scans and eset is very reliable, in my opinion you are ok.</s><s> now the trojan that was found was prior to you receiving a prompt from adobe and even then it was isolated by your anti-virus program.</s><s> had an "imposter" tried to download something, why would they download the adobe flash player, when they could have tried to download something worse?</s><s> your anti-virus caught the trojan, and probably would have caught the "imposter" that is just my opinion and based on how spyware and viruses work, in addition to you running scans and nothing was found.</s><s> i don't know what anti-virus you have installed on your computer, i use avast and can scan each and most every file.</s><s> can you do that with your installed program? 
</s><s>keep in mind also that adobe and microsoft use secure servers to download and since adobe just came out with an update for flash player, many people are getting prompts.</s><s> i received one myself and some of my friends have as well.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, ie8 is restrictive so that is why you couldn't update the activex.

2. yes, the gp.ocx is the getplus activex.</s><s> no i do not have this on my system.</s><s> if i did i would remove them all:-) you saw that for a moment from the detail box i would think.</s><s> why i don't know, it still installed.</s><s> 3. good 4. the nature of a trojan is to installed itself, but it did not, your anti-virus stopped it and isolated it.</s><s> on the update process, adobe i would think would advise of updates directly to your computer by secure servers just as microsoft does if you have automatic updates permitted.</s><s> even if you go to microsoft and install manually, same thing.</s><s> you can be sure these servers are well protected.</s><s> an imposter would have to have a lot more info than your ip address.</s><s> any website you visit gets that anytime you access it.</s><s> these bad guys automatically search for insecure computers, not a one on one basis.</s><s> just like you sometimes receive a recorded phone message, if you answer you hear it, if you don't there is no connection made.</s><s> same thing with the trojan, it rang, your anti-virus answered the call.</s><s> ha-ha 5.</s><s> i received my first prompt from adobe on 2/18/10, but was busy, so clicked on the "remind me later" option.</s><s> no, i don't know if it was signed or not and have never known in all the times fp has been updated.</s><s> i have never worried about that.</s><s> i don't think a bad guy is going to install a perfectly working flash player on my system, he wants more than that and if he got it, i'd have more problems than flash player. 
no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>hi verdy, well clearly this is not coming from adobe.</s><s> everyday the bad guys are at work and the anti-virus programs are constantly updating to battle this.</s><s> i don't see what adobe could do to combat spam. 
</s><s>microsoft just took a lot of heat with an update that was being blamed to cause the bsod for xp users that installed the windows update.</s><s> they investigated and the cause was a aurelon rootkit infection that was already on the computers that were having a problem.</s><s> this rootkit infection was able to change the windows kernel and the system was unstable then the update was an "effect" not the cause.</s><s> microsoft went to people's houses that reported these problems and got the hard drive info and ran multiple tests and were able to verify the exact problem.

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>)

</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

</s><s>anyway, your pointer links to a new phishing.</s><s> as i said above, the threat described is not phishing, it does not use social engineering, does not request personal data, does not want to convince us to visit a site (the worm can visit it directly) and does not even need to use it, it works just without it, making it potentially more dangerous. 
</s><s>and all the list of malwares listed in this pointer are already detected by my security tools.</s><s> but not this one which is clearly unrelated and more powerful.</s><s> the only common thing is that it will download and will try to install a fake flashplayer, using the existing capabilities (or security holes) of an original flashplayer (already up to date).

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>)

i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

i would still like to know why adobe sends unsigned automatic update notifications, signing or somehow being able to be easily checking the credibility of the update would have saved me some headaches.

<s>hi verdy, well clearly this is not coming from adobe.</s><s> everyday the bad guys are at work and the anti-virus programs are constantly updating to battle this.</s><s> i don't see what adobe could do to combat spam. 
</s><s>microsoft just took a lot of heat with an update that was being blamed to cause the bsod for xp users that installed the windows update.</s><s> they investigated and the cause was a aurelon rootkit infection that was already on the computers that were having a problem.</s><s> this rootkit infection was able to change the windows kernel and the system was unstable then the update was an "effect" not the cause.</s><s> microsoft went to people's houses that reported these problems and got the hard drive info and ran multiple tests and were able to verify the exact problem. 
</s><s>as anyone knows, a rootkit infection is a very serious matter and microsoft did an excellent investigation to find the cause.</s><s> also, other xp users that did not have the rootkit infection, installed the same update and no reports of any bsod has been reported.</s><s> and microsoft verified all of this in their testings. 
</s><s>perhaps before we blame adobe we might want to wait and see if something that microsoft just experienced has not happened.

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

</s><s>flash is supposed to be loaded by the <embed> element in an html mail from within an unsecure zone (notably if the email itself is not digitally signed from a secure domain): it should have the strict minimum authorizations: it should not run, it should just be able to render the first frame of static objects, but no user action should be allowed.activating "onmousehover" events immediately is a severe security hole in this case: i thought this was the case, but visibly, the malware authors of this swff have found a way to circumvent this restriction, and exploit it.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack. 
(we will still have to live with social engineering, but this is manageable.</s><s> i cannot easily manage automated scripts that run without any explicit user action, like here).

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, ie8 is restrictive so that is why you couldn't update the activex.

2. yes, the gp.ocx is the getplus activex.</s><s> no i do not have this on my system.</s><s> if i did i would remove them all:-) you saw that for a moment from the detail box i would think.</s><s> why i don't know, it still installed.</s><s> 3. good 4. the nature of a trojan is to installed itself, but it did not, your anti-virus stopped it and isolated it.</s><s> on the update process, adobe i would think would advise of updates directly to your computer by secure servers just as microsoft does if you have automatic updates permitted.</s><s> even if you go to microsoft and install manually, same thing.</s><s> you can be sure these servers are well protected.</s><s> an imposter would have to have a lot more info than your ip address.</s><s> any website you visit gets that anytime you access it.</s><s> these bad guys automatically search for insecure computers, not a one on one basis.</s><s> just like you sometimes receive a recorded phone message, if you answer you hear it, if you don't there is no connection made.</s><s> same thing with the trojan, it rang, your anti-virus answered the call.</s><s> ha-ha 5.</s><s> i received my first prompt from adobe on 2/18/10, but was busy, so clicked on the "remind me later" option.</s><s> no, i don't know if it was signed or not and have never known in all the times fp has been updated.</s><s> i have never worried about that.</s><s> i don't think a bad guy is going to install a perfectly working flash player on my system, he wants more than that and if he got it, i'd have more problems than flash player. 
no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer.

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, ie8 is restrictive so that is why you couldn't update the activex. 
</s><s>your#1.</s><s> i have never manually installed flash player; mine is installed from the prompt.</s><s> however, i am aware of the various adobe sites to install.</s><s> the one you used has the dlm that is used in addition to the getplus/nos.</s><s> not the best site to d/l from in my opinion.</s><s> for very large files is what it is for from my understanding.</s><s> i saw them in your flash folder. 
2. yes, the gp.ocx is the getplus activex.</s><s> no i do not have this on my system.</s><s> if i did i would remove them all:-) you saw that for a moment from the detail box i would think.</s><s> why i don't know, it still installed.</s><s> 3. good 4. the nature of a trojan is to installed itself, but it did not, your anti-virus stopped it and isolated it.</s><s> on the update process, adobe i would think would advise of updates directly to your computer by secure servers just as microsoft does if you have automatic updates permitted.</s><s> even if you go to microsoft and install manually, same thing.</s><s> you can be sure these servers are well protected.</s><s> an imposter would have to have a lot more info than your ip address.</s><s> any website you visit gets that anytime you access it.</s><s> these bad guys automatically search for insecure computers, not a one on one basis.</s><s> just like you sometimes receive a recorded phone message, if you answer you hear it, if you don't there is no connection made.</s><s> same thing with the trojan, it rang, your anti-virus answered the call.</s><s> ha-ha 5.</s><s> i received my first prompt from adobe on 2/18/10, but was busy, so clicked on the "remind me later" option.</s><s> no, i don't know if it was signed or not and have never known in all the times fp has been updated.</s><s> i have never worried about that.</s><s> i don't think a bad guy is going to install a perfectly working flash player on my system, he wants more than that and if he got it, i'd have more problems than flash player. 
no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>hi verdy, well clearly this is not coming from adobe.</s><s> everyday the bad guys are at work and the anti-virus programs are constantly updating to battle this.</s><s> i don't see what adobe could do to combat spam. 
</s><s>microsoft just took a lot of heat with an update that was being blamed to cause the bsod for xp users that installed the windows update.</s><s> they investigated and the cause was a aurelon rootkit infection that was already on the computers that were having a problem.</s><s> this rootkit infection was able to change the windows kernel and the system was unstable then the update was an "effect" not the cause.</s><s> microsoft went to people's houses that reported these problems and got the hard drive info and ran multiple tests and were able to verify the exact problem. 
</s><s>as anyone knows, a rootkit infection is a very serious matter and microsoft did an excellent investigation to find the cause.</s><s> also, other xp users that did not have the rootkit infection, installed the same update and no reports of any bsod has been reported.</s><s> and microsoft verified all of this in their testings. 
</s><s>perhaps before we blame adobe we might want to wait and see if something that microsoft just experienced has not happened.

</s><s>this time, this is not necessary, the component starts running immediately and starts playing in the local zone without an explicit user action.</s><s> that's why i think that there's a new security hole exploited, or that there's an incorrect assumption in the security checks performed by flashplayer before it activates the script stored within the swf file (which is loaded from an external domain (not related to the webmail domain or to the local untrusted zone of a local mail client). 
</s><s>flash is supposed to be loaded by the <embed> element in an html mail from within an unsecure zone (notably if the email itself is not digitally signed from a secure domain): it should have the strict minimum authorizations: it should not run, it should just be able to render the first frame of static objects, but no user action should be allowed.activating "onmousehover" events immediately is a severe security hole in this case: i thought this was the case, but visibly, the malware authors of this swff have found a way to circumvent this restriction, and exploit it.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack. 
(we will still have to live with social engineering, but this is manageable.</s><s> i cannot easily manage automated scripts that run without any explicit user action, like here).

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

</s><s>one other thing on this shockwave flash object.</s><s> in your post#1, you said you "deactivated" it after you became suspicious.</s><s> now anytime there is an uninstall or install of any program or like flash player, one must always reboot for the changes to take effect.</s><s> by "deactivating" this i think that stopped the process.</s><s> if the above trying to update the swo does not work, make sure it is enabled and then reboot(restart) your computer, before checking the flash files below.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, ie8 is restrictive so that is why you couldn't update the activex.

no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>hi verdy, well clearly this is not coming from adobe.</s><s> everyday the bad guys are at work and the anti-virus programs are constantly updating to battle this.</s><s> i don't see what adobe could do to combat spam.

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

</s><s>flash is supposed to be loaded by the <embed> element in an html mail from within an unsecure zone (notably if the email itself is not digitally signed from a secure domain): it should have the strict minimum authorizations: it should not run, it should just be able to render the first frame of static objects, but no user action should be allowed.activating "onmousehover" events immediately is a severe security hole in this case: i thought this was the case, but visibly, the malware authors of this swff have found a way to circumvent this restriction, and exploit it.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click.

i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack. 
(we will still have to live with social engineering, but this is manageable.</s><s> i cannot easily manage automated scripts that run without any explicit user action, like here).

<s>i can't call their phone line for that, and anyway i don't think that microsoft is involved in this case, even if this occurs on windows 7 (not xp as you have assumed above): i don't use ie (which is not installed at all) but google chrome (i've mostly abandoned firefox, which is too much risky in most of its numerous addons, and i much prefer a simpler browser with less dependencies and liabilities).</s><s> flashplayer is supported indirectly by google too (but google still does not detect this threat).

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer.

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

</s><s>this is the fake "flashplayer10.0.45.2.exe" that the swf above tries to install without needing a single click on the rendered video object.

</s><s>there's no detection for the swf worm itself, and then this is a security hole of the original flashplayer use as the original vector (because it honors "'mouveover" events to automatically download this fake flash installer). without changing any line of javascript code in the swf, it could download any other kind of malware.

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

</s><s>flash is supposed to be loaded by the <embed> element in an html mail from within an unsecure zone (notably if the email itself is not digitally signed from a secure domain): it should have the strict minimum authorizations: it should not run, it should just be able to render the first frame of static objects, but no user action should be allowed.activating "onmousehover" events immediately is a severe security hole in this case: i thought this was the case, but visibly, the malware authors of this swff have found a way to circumvent this restriction, and exploit it.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>)

</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, ie8 is restrictive so that is why you couldn't update the activex.

2. yes, the gp.ocx is the getplus activex.</s><s> no i do not have this on my system.</s><s> if i did i would remove them all:-) you saw that for a moment from the detail box i would think.</s><s> why i don't know, it still installed.</s><s> 3. good 4. the nature of a trojan is to installed itself, but it did not, your anti-virus stopped it and isolated it.</s><s> on the update process, adobe i would think would advise of updates directly to your computer by secure servers just as microsoft does if you have automatic updates permitted.</s><s> even if you go to microsoft and install manually, same thing.</s><s> you can be sure these servers are well protected.</s><s> an imposter would have to have a lot more info than your ip address.</s><s> any website you visit gets that anytime you access it.</s><s> these bad guys automatically search for insecure computers, not a one on one basis.</s><s> just like you sometimes receive a recorded phone message, if you answer you hear it, if you don't there is no connection made.</s><s> same thing with the trojan, it rang, your anti-virus answered the call.</s><s> ha-ha 5.</s><s> i received my first prompt from adobe on 2/18/10, but was busy, so clicked on the "remind me later" option.</s><s> no, i don't know if it was signed or not and have never known in all the times fp has been updated.</s><s> i have never worried about that.</s><s> i don't think a bad guy is going to install a perfectly working flash player on my system, he wants more than that and if he got it, i'd have more problems than flash player. 
no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer.

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, ie8 is restrictive so that is why you couldn't update the activex. 
</s><s>your#1.</s><s> i have never manually installed flash player; mine is installed from the prompt.</s><s> however, i am aware of the various adobe sites to install.</s><s> the one you used has the dlm that is used in addition to the getplus/nos.</s><s> not the best site to d/l from in my opinion.</s><s> for very large files is what it is for from my understanding.</s><s> i saw them in your flash folder. 
2. yes, the gp.ocx is the getplus activex.</s><s> no i do not have this on my system.</s><s> if i did i would remove them all:-) you saw that for a moment from the detail box i would think.</s><s> why i don't know, it still installed.</s><s> 3. good 4. the nature of a trojan is to installed itself, but it did not, your anti-virus stopped it and isolated it.</s><s> on the update process, adobe i would think would advise of updates directly to your computer by secure servers just as microsoft does if you have automatic updates permitted.</s><s> even if you go to microsoft and install manually, same thing.</s><s> you can be sure these servers are well protected.</s><s> an imposter would have to have a lot more info than your ip address.</s><s> any website you visit gets that anytime you access it.</s><s> these bad guys automatically search for insecure computers, not a one on one basis.</s><s> just like you sometimes receive a recorded phone message, if you answer you hear it, if you don't there is no connection made.</s><s> same thing with the trojan, it rang, your anti-virus answered the call.</s><s> ha-ha 5.</s><s> i received my first prompt from adobe on 2/18/10, but was busy, so clicked on the "remind me later" option.</s><s> no, i don't know if it was signed or not and have never known in all the times fp has been updated.</s><s> i have never worried about that.</s><s> i don't think a bad guy is going to install a perfectly working flash player on my system, he wants more than that and if he got it, i'd have more problems than flash player. 
no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>hi verdy, well clearly this is not coming from adobe.</s><s> everyday the bad guys are at work and the anti-virus programs are constantly updating to battle this.</s><s> i don't see what adobe could do to combat spam. 
</s><s>microsoft just took a lot of heat with an update that was being blamed to cause the bsod for xp users that installed the windows update.</s><s> they investigated and the cause was a aurelon rootkit infection that was already on the computers that were having a problem.</s><s> this rootkit infection was able to change the windows kernel and the system was unstable then the update was an "effect" not the cause.</s><s> microsoft went to people's houses that reported these problems and got the hard drive info and ran multiple tests and were able to verify the exact problem. 
</s><s>as anyone knows, a rootkit infection is a very serious matter and microsoft did an excellent investigation to find the cause.</s><s> also, other xp users that did not have the rootkit infection, installed the same update and no reports of any bsod has been reported.</s><s> and microsoft verified all of this in their testings. 
</s><s>perhaps before we blame adobe we might want to wait and see if something that microsoft just experienced has not happened.

</s><s>this time, this is not necessary, the component starts running immediately and starts playing in the local zone without an explicit user action.</s><s> that's why i think that there's a new security hole exploited, or that there's an incorrect assumption in the security checks performed by flashplayer before it activates the script stored within the swf file (which is loaded from an external domain (not related to the webmail domain or to the local untrusted zone of a local mail client). 
</s><s>flash is supposed to be loaded by the <embed> element in an html mail from within an unsecure zone (notably if the email itself is not digitally signed from a secure domain): it should have the strict minimum authorizations: it should not run, it should just be able to render the first frame of static objects, but no user action should be allowed.activating "onmousehover" events immediately is a severe security hole in this case: i thought this was the case, but visibly, the malware authors of this swff have found a way to circumvent this restriction, and exploit it.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack. 
(we will still have to live with social engineering, but this is manageable.</s><s> i cannot easily manage automated scripts that run without any explicit user action, like here).

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

</s><s>one other thing on this shockwave flash object.</s><s> in your post#1, you said you "deactivated" it after you became suspicious.</s><s> now anytime there is an uninstall or install of any program or like flash player, one must always reboot for the changes to take effect.</s><s> by "deactivating" this i think that stopped the process.</s><s> if the above trying to update the swo does not work, make sure it is enabled and then reboot(restart) your computer, before checking the flash files below.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, ie8 is restrictive so that is why you couldn't update the activex.

no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>hi verdy, well clearly this is not coming from adobe.</s><s> everyday the bad guys are at work and the anti-virus programs are constantly updating to battle this.</s><s> i don't see what adobe could do to combat spam.

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

</s><s>flash is supposed to be loaded by the <embed> element in an html mail from within an unsecure zone (notably if the email itself is not digitally signed from a secure domain): it should have the strict minimum authorizations: it should not run, it should just be able to render the first frame of static objects, but no user action should be allowed.activating "onmousehover" events immediately is a severe security hole in this case: i thought this was the case, but visibly, the malware authors of this swff have found a way to circumvent this restriction, and exploit it.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click.

i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack. 
(we will still have to live with social engineering, but this is manageable.</s><s> i cannot easily manage automated scripts that run without any explicit user action, like here).

<s>i can't call their phone line for that, and anyway i don't think that microsoft is involved in this case, even if this occurs on windows 7 (not xp as you have assumed above): i don't use ie (which is not installed at all) but google chrome (i've mostly abandoned firefox, which is too much risky in most of its numerous addons, and i much prefer a simpler browser with less dependencies and liabilities).</s><s> flashplayer is supported indirectly by google too (but google still does not detect this threat).

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer.

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

</s><s>this is the fake "flashplayer10.0.45.2.exe" that the swf above tries to install without needing a single click on the rendered video object.

</s><s>there's no detection for the swf worm itself, and then this is a security hole of the original flashplayer use as the original vector (because it honors "'mouveover" events to automatically download this fake flash installer). without changing any line of javascript code in the swf, it could download any other kind of malware.

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

</s><s>flash is supposed to be loaded by the <embed> element in an html mail from within an unsecure zone (notably if the email itself is not digitally signed from a secure domain): it should have the strict minimum authorizations: it should not run, it should just be able to render the first frame of static objects, but no user action should be allowed.activating "onmousehover" events immediately is a severe security hole in this case: i thought this was the case, but visibly, the malware authors of this swff have found a way to circumvent this restriction, and exploit it.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>)

</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, ie8 is restrictive so that is why you couldn't update the activex.

2. yes, the gp.ocx is the getplus activex.</s><s> no i do not have this on my system.</s><s> if i did i would remove them all:-) you saw that for a moment from the detail box i would think.</s><s> why i don't know, it still installed.</s><s> 3. good 4. the nature of a trojan is to installed itself, but it did not, your anti-virus stopped it and isolated it.</s><s> on the update process, adobe i would think would advise of updates directly to your computer by secure servers just as microsoft does if you have automatic updates permitted.</s><s> even if you go to microsoft and install manually, same thing.</s><s> you can be sure these servers are well protected.</s><s> an imposter would have to have a lot more info than your ip address.</s><s> any website you visit gets that anytime you access it.</s><s> these bad guys automatically search for insecure computers, not a one on one basis.</s><s> just like you sometimes receive a recorded phone message, if you answer you hear it, if you don't there is no connection made.</s><s> same thing with the trojan, it rang, your anti-virus answered the call.</s><s> ha-ha 5.</s><s> i received my first prompt from adobe on 2/18/10, but was busy, so clicked on the "remind me later" option.</s><s> no, i don't know if it was signed or not and have never known in all the times fp has been updated.</s><s> i have never worried about that.</s><s> i don't think a bad guy is going to install a perfectly working flash player on my system, he wants more than that and if he got it, i'd have more problems than flash player. 
no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer.

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, ie8 is restrictive so that is why you couldn't update the activex. 
</s><s>your#1.</s><s> i have never manually installed flash player; mine is installed from the prompt.</s><s> however, i am aware of the various adobe sites to install.</s><s> the one you used has the dlm that is used in addition to the getplus/nos.</s><s> not the best site to d/l from in my opinion.</s><s> for very large files is what it is for from my understanding.</s><s> i saw them in your flash folder. 
2. yes, the gp.ocx is the getplus activex.</s><s> no i do not have this on my system.</s><s> if i did i would remove them all:-) you saw that for a moment from the detail box i would think.</s><s> why i don't know, it still installed.</s><s> 3. good 4. the nature of a trojan is to installed itself, but it did not, your anti-virus stopped it and isolated it.</s><s> on the update process, adobe i would think would advise of updates directly to your computer by secure servers just as microsoft does if you have automatic updates permitted.</s><s> even if you go to microsoft and install manually, same thing.</s><s> you can be sure these servers are well protected.</s><s> an imposter would have to have a lot more info than your ip address.</s><s> any website you visit gets that anytime you access it.</s><s> these bad guys automatically search for insecure computers, not a one on one basis.</s><s> just like you sometimes receive a recorded phone message, if you answer you hear it, if you don't there is no connection made.</s><s> same thing with the trojan, it rang, your anti-virus answered the call.</s><s> ha-ha 5.</s><s> i received my first prompt from adobe on 2/18/10, but was busy, so clicked on the "remind me later" option.</s><s> no, i don't know if it was signed or not and have never known in all the times fp has been updated.</s><s> i have never worried about that.</s><s> i don't think a bad guy is going to install a perfectly working flash player on my system, he wants more than that and if he got it, i'd have more problems than flash player. 
no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>hi verdy, well clearly this is not coming from adobe.</s><s> everyday the bad guys are at work and the anti-virus programs are constantly updating to battle this.</s><s> i don't see what adobe could do to combat spam. 
</s><s>microsoft just took a lot of heat with an update that was being blamed to cause the bsod for xp users that installed the windows update.</s><s> they investigated and the cause was a aurelon rootkit infection that was already on the computers that were having a problem.</s><s> this rootkit infection was able to change the windows kernel and the system was unstable then the update was an "effect" not the cause.</s><s> microsoft went to people's houses that reported these problems and got the hard drive info and ran multiple tests and were able to verify the exact problem. 
</s><s>as anyone knows, a rootkit infection is a very serious matter and microsoft did an excellent investigation to find the cause.</s><s> also, other xp users that did not have the rootkit infection, installed the same update and no reports of any bsod has been reported.</s><s> and microsoft verified all of this in their testings. 
</s><s>perhaps before we blame adobe we might want to wait and see if something that microsoft just experienced has not happened.

</s><s>this time, this is not necessary, the component starts running immediately and starts playing in the local zone without an explicit user action.</s><s> that's why i think that there's a new security hole exploited, or that there's an incorrect assumption in the security checks performed by flashplayer before it activates the script stored within the swf file (which is loaded from an external domain (not related to the webmail domain or to the local untrusted zone of a local mail client). 
</s><s>flash is supposed to be loaded by the <embed> element in an html mail from within an unsecure zone (notably if the email itself is not digitally signed from a secure domain): it should have the strict minimum authorizations: it should not run, it should just be able to render the first frame of static objects, but no user action should be allowed.activating "onmousehover" events immediately is a severe security hole in this case: i thought this was the case, but visibly, the malware authors of this swff have found a way to circumvent this restriction, and exploit it.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack. 
(we will still have to live with social engineering, but this is manageable.</s><s> i cannot easily manage automated scripts that run without any explicit user action, like here).

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

</s><s>one other thing on this shockwave flash object.</s><s> in your post#1, you said you "deactivated" it after you became suspicious.</s><s> now anytime there is an uninstall or install of any program or like flash player, one must always reboot for the changes to take effect.</s><s> by "deactivating" this i think that stopped the process.</s><s> if the above trying to update the swo does not work, make sure it is enabled and then reboot(restart) your computer, before checking the flash files below.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, ie8 is restrictive so that is why you couldn't update the activex.

no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>hi verdy, well clearly this is not coming from adobe.</s><s> everyday the bad guys are at work and the anti-virus programs are constantly updating to battle this.</s><s> i don't see what adobe could do to combat spam.

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

</s><s>flash is supposed to be loaded by the <embed> element in an html mail from within an unsecure zone (notably if the email itself is not digitally signed from a secure domain): it should have the strict minimum authorizations: it should not run, it should just be able to render the first frame of static objects, but no user action should be allowed.activating "onmousehover" events immediately is a severe security hole in this case: i thought this was the case, but visibly, the malware authors of this swff have found a way to circumvent this restriction, and exploit it.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click.

i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack. 
(we will still have to live with social engineering, but this is manageable.</s><s> i cannot easily manage automated scripts that run without any explicit user action, like here).

<s>i can't call their phone line for that, and anyway i don't think that microsoft is involved in this case, even if this occurs on windows 7 (not xp as you have assumed above): i don't use ie (which is not installed at all) but google chrome (i've mostly abandoned firefox, which is too much risky in most of its numerous addons, and i much prefer a simpler browser with less dependencies and liabilities).</s><s> flashplayer is supported indirectly by google too (but google still does not detect this threat).

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer.

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

</s><s>this is the fake "flashplayer10.0.45.2.exe" that the swf above tries to install without needing a single click on the rendered video object.

</s><s>there's no detection for the swf worm itself, and then this is a security hole of the original flashplayer use as the original vector (because it honors "'mouveover" events to automatically download this fake flash installer). without changing any line of javascript code in the swf, it could download any other kind of malware.

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

</s><s>flash is supposed to be loaded by the <embed> element in an html mail from within an unsecure zone (notably if the email itself is not digitally signed from a secure domain): it should have the strict minimum authorizations: it should not run, it should just be able to render the first frame of static objects, but no user action should be allowed.activating "onmousehover" events immediately is a severe security hole in this case: i thought this was the case, but visibly, the malware authors of this swff have found a way to circumvent this restriction, and exploit it.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>)

</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, ie8 is restrictive so that is why you couldn't update the activex.

2. yes, the gp.ocx is the getplus activex.</s><s> no i do not have this on my system.</s><s> if i did i would remove them all:-) you saw that for a moment from the detail box i would think.</s><s> why i don't know, it still installed.</s><s> 3. good 4. the nature of a trojan is to installed itself, but it did not, your anti-virus stopped it and isolated it.</s><s> on the update process, adobe i would think would advise of updates directly to your computer by secure servers just as microsoft does if you have automatic updates permitted.</s><s> even if you go to microsoft and install manually, same thing.</s><s> you can be sure these servers are well protected.</s><s> an imposter would have to have a lot more info than your ip address.</s><s> any website you visit gets that anytime you access it.</s><s> these bad guys automatically search for insecure computers, not a one on one basis.</s><s> just like you sometimes receive a recorded phone message, if you answer you hear it, if you don't there is no connection made.</s><s> same thing with the trojan, it rang, your anti-virus answered the call.</s><s> ha-ha 5.</s><s> i received my first prompt from adobe on 2/18/10, but was busy, so clicked on the "remind me later" option.</s><s> no, i don't know if it was signed or not and have never known in all the times fp has been updated.</s><s> i have never worried about that.</s><s> i don't think a bad guy is going to install a perfectly working flash player on my system, he wants more than that and if he got it, i'd have more problems than flash player. 
no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer.

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, ie8 is restrictive so that is why you couldn't update the activex. 
</s><s>your#1.</s><s> i have never manually installed flash player; mine is installed from the prompt.</s><s> however, i am aware of the various adobe sites to install.</s><s> the one you used has the dlm that is used in addition to the getplus/nos.</s><s> not the best site to d/l from in my opinion.</s><s> for very large files is what it is for from my understanding.</s><s> i saw them in your flash folder. 
2. yes, the gp.ocx is the getplus activex.</s><s> no i do not have this on my system.</s><s> if i did i would remove them all:-) you saw that for a moment from the detail box i would think.</s><s> why i don't know, it still installed.</s><s> 3. good 4. the nature of a trojan is to installed itself, but it did not, your anti-virus stopped it and isolated it.</s><s> on the update process, adobe i would think would advise of updates directly to your computer by secure servers just as microsoft does if you have automatic updates permitted.</s><s> even if you go to microsoft and install manually, same thing.</s><s> you can be sure these servers are well protected.</s><s> an imposter would have to have a lot more info than your ip address.</s><s> any website you visit gets that anytime you access it.</s><s> these bad guys automatically search for insecure computers, not a one on one basis.</s><s> just like you sometimes receive a recorded phone message, if you answer you hear it, if you don't there is no connection made.</s><s> same thing with the trojan, it rang, your anti-virus answered the call.</s><s> ha-ha 5.</s><s> i received my first prompt from adobe on 2/18/10, but was busy, so clicked on the "remind me later" option.</s><s> no, i don't know if it was signed or not and have never known in all the times fp has been updated.</s><s> i have never worried about that.</s><s> i don't think a bad guy is going to install a perfectly working flash player on my system, he wants more than that and if he got it, i'd have more problems than flash player. 
no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>hi verdy, well clearly this is not coming from adobe.</s><s> everyday the bad guys are at work and the anti-virus programs are constantly updating to battle this.</s><s> i don't see what adobe could do to combat spam. 
</s><s>microsoft just took a lot of heat with an update that was being blamed to cause the bsod for xp users that installed the windows update.</s><s> they investigated and the cause was a aurelon rootkit infection that was already on the computers that were having a problem.</s><s> this rootkit infection was able to change the windows kernel and the system was unstable then the update was an "effect" not the cause.</s><s> microsoft went to people's houses that reported these problems and got the hard drive info and ran multiple tests and were able to verify the exact problem. 
</s><s>as anyone knows, a rootkit infection is a very serious matter and microsoft did an excellent investigation to find the cause.</s><s> also, other xp users that did not have the rootkit infection, installed the same update and no reports of any bsod has been reported.</s><s> and microsoft verified all of this in their testings. 
</s><s>perhaps before we blame adobe we might want to wait and see if something that microsoft just experienced has not happened.

</s><s>this time, this is not necessary, the component starts running immediately and starts playing in the local zone without an explicit user action.</s><s> that's why i think that there's a new security hole exploited, or that there's an incorrect assumption in the security checks performed by flashplayer before it activates the script stored within the swf file (which is loaded from an external domain (not related to the webmail domain or to the local untrusted zone of a local mail client). 
</s><s>flash is supposed to be loaded by the <embed> element in an html mail from within an unsecure zone (notably if the email itself is not digitally signed from a secure domain): it should have the strict minimum authorizations: it should not run, it should just be able to render the first frame of static objects, but no user action should be allowed.activating "onmousehover" events immediately is a severe security hole in this case: i thought this was the case, but visibly, the malware authors of this swff have found a way to circumvent this restriction, and exploit it.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack. 
(we will still have to live with social engineering, but this is manageable.</s><s> i cannot easily manage automated scripts that run without any explicit user action, like here).

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

</s><s>one other thing on this shockwave flash object.</s><s> in your post#1, you said you "deactivated" it after you became suspicious.</s><s> now anytime there is an uninstall or install of any program or like flash player, one must always reboot for the changes to take effect.</s><s> by "deactivating" this i think that stopped the process.</s><s> if the above trying to update the swo does not work, make sure it is enabled and then reboot(restart) your computer, before checking the flash files below.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, ie8 is restrictive so that is why you couldn't update the activex.

no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>hi verdy, well clearly this is not coming from adobe.</s><s> everyday the bad guys are at work and the anti-virus programs are constantly updating to battle this.</s><s> i don't see what adobe could do to combat spam.

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

</s><s>flash is supposed to be loaded by the <embed> element in an html mail from within an unsecure zone (notably if the email itself is not digitally signed from a secure domain): it should have the strict minimum authorizations: it should not run, it should just be able to render the first frame of static objects, but no user action should be allowed.activating "onmousehover" events immediately is a severe security hole in this case: i thought this was the case, but visibly, the malware authors of this swff have found a way to circumvent this restriction, and exploit it.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click.

i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack. 
(we will still have to live with social engineering, but this is manageable.</s><s> i cannot easily manage automated scripts that run without any explicit user action, like here).

<s>i can't call their phone line for that, and anyway i don't think that microsoft is involved in this case, even if this occurs on windows 7 (not xp as you have assumed above): i don't use ie (which is not installed at all) but google chrome (i've mostly abandoned firefox, which is too much risky in most of its numerous addons, and i much prefer a simpler browser with less dependencies and liabilities).</s><s> flashplayer is supported indirectly by google too (but google still does not detect this threat).

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer.

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

</s><s>this is the fake "flashplayer10.0.45.2.exe" that the swf above tries to install without needing a single click on the rendered video object.

</s><s>there's no detection for the swf worm itself, and then this is a security hole of the original flashplayer use as the original vector (because it honors "'mouveover" events to automatically download this fake flash installer). without changing any line of javascript code in the swf, it could download any other kind of malware.

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

</s><s>flash is supposed to be loaded by the <embed> element in an html mail from within an unsecure zone (notably if the email itself is not digitally signed from a secure domain): it should have the strict minimum authorizations: it should not run, it should just be able to render the first frame of static objects, but no user action should be allowed.activating "onmousehover" events immediately is a severe security hole in this case: i thought this was the case, but visibly, the malware authors of this swff have found a way to circumvent this restriction, and exploit it.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>)

</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, ie8 is restrictive so that is why you couldn't update the activex.

2. yes, the gp.ocx is the getplus activex.</s><s> no i do not have this on my system.</s><s> if i did i would remove them all:-) you saw that for a moment from the detail box i would think.</s><s> why i don't know, it still installed.</s><s> 3. good 4. the nature of a trojan is to installed itself, but it did not, your anti-virus stopped it and isolated it.</s><s> on the update process, adobe i would think would advise of updates directly to your computer by secure servers just as microsoft does if you have automatic updates permitted.</s><s> even if you go to microsoft and install manually, same thing.</s><s> you can be sure these servers are well protected.</s><s> an imposter would have to have a lot more info than your ip address.</s><s> any website you visit gets that anytime you access it.</s><s> these bad guys automatically search for insecure computers, not a one on one basis.</s><s> just like you sometimes receive a recorded phone message, if you answer you hear it, if you don't there is no connection made.</s><s> same thing with the trojan, it rang, your anti-virus answered the call.</s><s> ha-ha 5.</s><s> i received my first prompt from adobe on 2/18/10, but was busy, so clicked on the "remind me later" option.</s><s> no, i don't know if it was signed or not and have never known in all the times fp has been updated.</s><s> i have never worried about that.</s><s> i don't think a bad guy is going to install a perfectly working flash player on my system, he wants more than that and if he got it, i'd have more problems than flash player. 
no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer.

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, ie8 is restrictive so that is why you couldn't update the activex. 
</s><s>your#1.</s><s> i have never manually installed flash player; mine is installed from the prompt.</s><s> however, i am aware of the various adobe sites to install.</s><s> the one you used has the dlm that is used in addition to the getplus/nos.</s><s> not the best site to d/l from in my opinion.</s><s> for very large files is what it is for from my understanding.</s><s> i saw them in your flash folder. 
2. yes, the gp.ocx is the getplus activex.</s><s> no i do not have this on my system.</s><s> if i did i would remove them all:-) you saw that for a moment from the detail box i would think.</s><s> why i don't know, it still installed.</s><s> 3. good 4. the nature of a trojan is to installed itself, but it did not, your anti-virus stopped it and isolated it.</s><s> on the update process, adobe i would think would advise of updates directly to your computer by secure servers just as microsoft does if you have automatic updates permitted.</s><s> even if you go to microsoft and install manually, same thing.</s><s> you can be sure these servers are well protected.</s><s> an imposter would have to have a lot more info than your ip address.</s><s> any website you visit gets that anytime you access it.</s><s> these bad guys automatically search for insecure computers, not a one on one basis.</s><s> just like you sometimes receive a recorded phone message, if you answer you hear it, if you don't there is no connection made.</s><s> same thing with the trojan, it rang, your anti-virus answered the call.</s><s> ha-ha 5.</s><s> i received my first prompt from adobe on 2/18/10, but was busy, so clicked on the "remind me later" option.</s><s> no, i don't know if it was signed or not and have never known in all the times fp has been updated.</s><s> i have never worried about that.</s><s> i don't think a bad guy is going to install a perfectly working flash player on my system, he wants more than that and if he got it, i'd have more problems than flash player. 
no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>hi verdy, well clearly this is not coming from adobe.</s><s> everyday the bad guys are at work and the anti-virus programs are constantly updating to battle this.</s><s> i don't see what adobe could do to combat spam. 
</s><s>microsoft just took a lot of heat with an update that was being blamed to cause the bsod for xp users that installed the windows update.</s><s> they investigated and the cause was a aurelon rootkit infection that was already on the computers that were having a problem.</s><s> this rootkit infection was able to change the windows kernel and the system was unstable then the update was an "effect" not the cause.</s><s> microsoft went to people's houses that reported these problems and got the hard drive info and ran multiple tests and were able to verify the exact problem. 
</s><s>as anyone knows, a rootkit infection is a very serious matter and microsoft did an excellent investigation to find the cause.</s><s> also, other xp users that did not have the rootkit infection, installed the same update and no reports of any bsod has been reported.</s><s> and microsoft verified all of this in their testings. 
</s><s>perhaps before we blame adobe we might want to wait and see if something that microsoft just experienced has not happened.

</s><s>this time, this is not necessary, the component starts running immediately and starts playing in the local zone without an explicit user action.</s><s> that's why i think that there's a new security hole exploited, or that there's an incorrect assumption in the security checks performed by flashplayer before it activates the script stored within the swf file (which is loaded from an external domain (not related to the webmail domain or to the local untrusted zone of a local mail client). 
</s><s>flash is supposed to be loaded by the <embed> element in an html mail from within an unsecure zone (notably if the email itself is not digitally signed from a secure domain): it should have the strict minimum authorizations: it should not run, it should just be able to render the first frame of static objects, but no user action should be allowed.activating "onmousehover" events immediately is a severe security hole in this case: i thought this was the case, but visibly, the malware authors of this swff have found a way to circumvent this restriction, and exploit it.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack. 
(we will still have to live with social engineering, but this is manageable.</s><s> i cannot easily manage automated scripts that run without any explicit user action, like here).

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

</s><s>one other thing on this shockwave flash object.</s><s> in your post#1, you said you "deactivated" it after you became suspicious.</s><s> now anytime there is an uninstall or install of any program or like flash player, one must always reboot for the changes to take effect.</s><s> by "deactivating" this i think that stopped the process.</s><s> if the above trying to update the swo does not work, make sure it is enabled and then reboot(restart) your computer, before checking the flash files below.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, ie8 is restrictive so that is why you couldn't update the activex.

no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>hi verdy, well clearly this is not coming from adobe.</s><s> everyday the bad guys are at work and the anti-virus programs are constantly updating to battle this.</s><s> i don't see what adobe could do to combat spam.

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

</s><s>flash is supposed to be loaded by the <embed> element in an html mail from within an unsecure zone (notably if the email itself is not digitally signed from a secure domain): it should have the strict minimum authorizations: it should not run, it should just be able to render the first frame of static objects, but no user action should be allowed.activating "onmousehover" events immediately is a severe security hole in this case: i thought this was the case, but visibly, the malware authors of this swff have found a way to circumvent this restriction, and exploit it.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click.

i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack. 
(we will still have to live with social engineering, but this is manageable.</s><s> i cannot easily manage automated scripts that run without any explicit user action, like here).

<s>i can't call their phone line for that, and anyway i don't think that microsoft is involved in this case, even if this occurs on windows 7 (not xp as you have assumed above): i don't use ie (which is not installed at all) but google chrome (i've mostly abandoned firefox, which is too much risky in most of its numerous addons, and i much prefer a simpler browser with less dependencies and liabilities).</s><s> flashplayer is supported indirectly by google too (but google still does not detect this threat).

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer.

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

</s><s>this is the fake "flashplayer10.0.45.2.exe" that the swf above tries to install without needing a single click on the rendered video object.

</s><s>there's no detection for the swf worm itself, and then this is a security hole of the original flashplayer use as the original vector (because it honors "'mouveover" events to automatically download this fake flash installer). without changing any line of javascript code in the swf, it could download any other kind of malware.

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

</s><s>flash is supposed to be loaded by the <embed> element in an html mail from within an unsecure zone (notably if the email itself is not digitally signed from a secure domain): it should have the strict minimum authorizations: it should not run, it should just be able to render the first frame of static objects, but no user action should be allowed.activating "onmousehover" events immediately is a severe security hole in this case: i thought this was the case, but visibly, the malware authors of this swff have found a way to circumvent this restriction, and exploit it.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>)

</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, ie8 is restrictive so that is why you couldn't update the activex.

2. yes, the gp.ocx is the getplus activex.</s><s> no i do not have this on my system.</s><s> if i did i would remove them all:-) you saw that for a moment from the detail box i would think.</s><s> why i don't know, it still installed.</s><s> 3. good 4. the nature of a trojan is to installed itself, but it did not, your anti-virus stopped it and isolated it.</s><s> on the update process, adobe i would think would advise of updates directly to your computer by secure servers just as microsoft does if you have automatic updates permitted.</s><s> even if you go to microsoft and install manually, same thing.</s><s> you can be sure these servers are well protected.</s><s> an imposter would have to have a lot more info than your ip address.</s><s> any website you visit gets that anytime you access it.</s><s> these bad guys automatically search for insecure computers, not a one on one basis.</s><s> just like you sometimes receive a recorded phone message, if you answer you hear it, if you don't there is no connection made.</s><s> same thing with the trojan, it rang, your anti-virus answered the call.</s><s> ha-ha 5.</s><s> i received my first prompt from adobe on 2/18/10, but was busy, so clicked on the "remind me later" option.</s><s> no, i don't know if it was signed or not and have never known in all the times fp has been updated.</s><s> i have never worried about that.</s><s> i don't think a bad guy is going to install a perfectly working flash player on my system, he wants more than that and if he got it, i'd have more problems than flash player. 
no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer.

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, ie8 is restrictive so that is why you couldn't update the activex. 
</s><s>your#1.</s><s> i have never manually installed flash player; mine is installed from the prompt.</s><s> however, i am aware of the various adobe sites to install.</s><s> the one you used has the dlm that is used in addition to the getplus/nos.</s><s> not the best site to d/l from in my opinion.</s><s> for very large files is what it is for from my understanding.</s><s> i saw them in your flash folder. 
2. yes, the gp.ocx is the getplus activex.</s><s> no i do not have this on my system.</s><s> if i did i would remove them all:-) you saw that for a moment from the detail box i would think.</s><s> why i don't know, it still installed.</s><s> 3. good 4. the nature of a trojan is to installed itself, but it did not, your anti-virus stopped it and isolated it.</s><s> on the update process, adobe i would think would advise of updates directly to your computer by secure servers just as microsoft does if you have automatic updates permitted.</s><s> even if you go to microsoft and install manually, same thing.</s><s> you can be sure these servers are well protected.</s><s> an imposter would have to have a lot more info than your ip address.</s><s> any website you visit gets that anytime you access it.</s><s> these bad guys automatically search for insecure computers, not a one on one basis.</s><s> just like you sometimes receive a recorded phone message, if you answer you hear it, if you don't there is no connection made.</s><s> same thing with the trojan, it rang, your anti-virus answered the call.</s><s> ha-ha 5.</s><s> i received my first prompt from adobe on 2/18/10, but was busy, so clicked on the "remind me later" option.</s><s> no, i don't know if it was signed or not and have never known in all the times fp has been updated.</s><s> i have never worried about that.</s><s> i don't think a bad guy is going to install a perfectly working flash player on my system, he wants more than that and if he got it, i'd have more problems than flash player. 
no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>hi verdy, well clearly this is not coming from adobe.</s><s> everyday the bad guys are at work and the anti-virus programs are constantly updating to battle this.</s><s> i don't see what adobe could do to combat spam. 
</s><s>microsoft just took a lot of heat with an update that was being blamed to cause the bsod for xp users that installed the windows update.</s><s> they investigated and the cause was a aurelon rootkit infection that was already on the computers that were having a problem.</s><s> this rootkit infection was able to change the windows kernel and the system was unstable then the update was an "effect" not the cause.</s><s> microsoft went to people's houses that reported these problems and got the hard drive info and ran multiple tests and were able to verify the exact problem. 
</s><s>as anyone knows, a rootkit infection is a very serious matter and microsoft did an excellent investigation to find the cause.</s><s> also, other xp users that did not have the rootkit infection, installed the same update and no reports of any bsod has been reported.</s><s> and microsoft verified all of this in their testings. 
</s><s>perhaps before we blame adobe we might want to wait and see if something that microsoft just experienced has not happened.

</s><s>this time, this is not necessary, the component starts running immediately and starts playing in the local zone without an explicit user action.</s><s> that's why i think that there's a new security hole exploited, or that there's an incorrect assumption in the security checks performed by flashplayer before it activates the script stored within the swf file (which is loaded from an external domain (not related to the webmail domain or to the local untrusted zone of a local mail client). 
</s><s>flash is supposed to be loaded by the <embed> element in an html mail from within an unsecure zone (notably if the email itself is not digitally signed from a secure domain): it should have the strict minimum authorizations: it should not run, it should just be able to render the first frame of static objects, but no user action should be allowed.activating "onmousehover" events immediately is a severe security hole in this case: i thought this was the case, but visibly, the malware authors of this swff have found a way to circumvent this restriction, and exploit it.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack. 
(we will still have to live with social engineering, but this is manageable.</s><s> i cannot easily manage automated scripts that run without any explicit user action, like here).

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

</s><s>one other thing on this shockwave flash object.</s><s> in your post#1, you said you "deactivated" it after you became suspicious.</s><s> now anytime there is an uninstall or install of any program or like flash player, one must always reboot for the changes to take effect.</s><s> by "deactivating" this i think that stopped the process.</s><s> if the above trying to update the swo does not work, make sure it is enabled and then reboot(restart) your computer, before checking the flash files below.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, ie8 is restrictive so that is why you couldn't update the activex.

no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>hi verdy, well clearly this is not coming from adobe.</s><s> everyday the bad guys are at work and the anti-virus programs are constantly updating to battle this.</s><s> i don't see what adobe could do to combat spam.

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

</s><s>flash is supposed to be loaded by the <embed> element in an html mail from within an unsecure zone (notably if the email itself is not digitally signed from a secure domain): it should have the strict minimum authorizations: it should not run, it should just be able to render the first frame of static objects, but no user action should be allowed.activating "onmousehover" events immediately is a severe security hole in this case: i thought this was the case, but visibly, the malware authors of this swff have found a way to circumvent this restriction, and exploit it.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click.

i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack. 
(we will still have to live with social engineering, but this is manageable.</s><s> i cannot easily manage automated scripts that run without any explicit user action, like here).

<s>i can't call their phone line for that, and anyway i don't think that microsoft is involved in this case, even if this occurs on windows 7 (not xp as you have assumed above): i don't use ie (which is not installed at all) but google chrome (i've mostly abandoned firefox, which is too much risky in most of its numerous addons, and i much prefer a simpler browser with less dependencies and liabilities).</s><s> flashplayer is supported indirectly by google too (but google still does not detect this threat).

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer.

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

</s><s>this is the fake "flashplayer10.0.45.2.exe" that the swf above tries to install without needing a single click on the rendered video object.

</s><s>there's no detection for the swf worm itself, and then this is a security hole of the original flashplayer use as the original vector (because it honors "'mouveover" events to automatically download this fake flash installer). without changing any line of javascript code in the swf, it could download any other kind of malware.

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

</s><s>flash is supposed to be loaded by the <embed> element in an html mail from within an unsecure zone (notably if the email itself is not digitally signed from a secure domain): it should have the strict minimum authorizations: it should not run, it should just be able to render the first frame of static objects, but no user action should be allowed.activating "onmousehover" events immediately is a severe security hole in this case: i thought this was the case, but visibly, the malware authors of this swff have found a way to circumvent this restriction, and exploit it.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>)

</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, ie8 is restrictive so that is why you couldn't update the activex.

2. yes, the gp.ocx is the getplus activex.</s><s> no i do not have this on my system.</s><s> if i did i would remove them all:-) you saw that for a moment from the detail box i would think.</s><s> why i don't know, it still installed.</s><s> 3. good 4. the nature of a trojan is to installed itself, but it did not, your anti-virus stopped it and isolated it.</s><s> on the update process, adobe i would think would advise of updates directly to your computer by secure servers just as microsoft does if you have automatic updates permitted.</s><s> even if you go to microsoft and install manually, same thing.</s><s> you can be sure these servers are well protected.</s><s> an imposter would have to have a lot more info than your ip address.</s><s> any website you visit gets that anytime you access it.</s><s> these bad guys automatically search for insecure computers, not a one on one basis.</s><s> just like you sometimes receive a recorded phone message, if you answer you hear it, if you don't there is no connection made.</s><s> same thing with the trojan, it rang, your anti-virus answered the call.</s><s> ha-ha 5.</s><s> i received my first prompt from adobe on 2/18/10, but was busy, so clicked on the "remind me later" option.</s><s> no, i don't know if it was signed or not and have never known in all the times fp has been updated.</s><s> i have never worried about that.</s><s> i don't think a bad guy is going to install a perfectly working flash player on my system, he wants more than that and if he got it, i'd have more problems than flash player. 
no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer.

<s>i didn't say that the original adove flashplayer was malicious or bogous.</s><s> but i'bve still never seen a swf file activated this way from a spam.</s><s> before, it alwyas required a user action to activate it, so the spams used "social engineering" to convince recipients to open the attachment or to activate the component.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack.

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>hi eidnolb, 
first of all: thanks for all your work you invest in this. 
</s><s>here my answer to your remarks: 
1) there is no update button in ie8.</s><s> i used the adobe "uninstall_flash_player.exe" in the meantime to delete both the firefox plugin and the ie8 activex control.</s><s> i reinstalled both again from the "get.adobe.com" website.</s><s> you'll find a listing of my "macromed" folder attached to this message, it is located in the "c:\windows\syswow64" folder on my computer. 
2) when installing the ie8 flash player, i noticed a curious thing happening: i could view a second entry in the tools/add on dialog box of ie8 directly below the flash player entry, which was vanished when i looked a second time.</s><s> the control this entry referred to is gp.ocx, which is signed by adobe.</s><s> please see the attached jpeg for the directory where this control is located (the directory path is <c:\program files (x86)\nos\bin>).</s><s> do you have the same on your computer? 
3) i run eset nod32 and yes, i can do a complete check of memory/harddisk.</s><s> as stated in my previous message, i also ran a complete system check with malwarebytes' anti-malware. 
4) regarding the imposter thing: i'm just worried somebody recorded my computers address when the first attack failed and attempted a second one.</s><s> it all depends on how automatic update requests via internet work: if they are only started by background processes on my own computer (repeatedly checking if an update is available) or if one can initiate something like this from "the internet".</s><s> i do not really know very much about this. 
5) when did you receive your update for flash player?</s><s> do you still know if in the initial window starting the update process the program was signed or not?

<s>hi tomasz77, ie8 is restrictive so that is why you couldn't update the activex. 
</s><s>your#1.</s><s> i have never manually installed flash player; mine is installed from the prompt.</s><s> however, i am aware of the various adobe sites to install.</s><s> the one you used has the dlm that is used in addition to the getplus/nos.</s><s> not the best site to d/l from in my opinion.</s><s> for very large files is what it is for from my understanding.</s><s> i saw them in your flash folder. 
2. yes, the gp.ocx is the getplus activex.</s><s> no i do not have this on my system.</s><s> if i did i would remove them all:-) you saw that for a moment from the detail box i would think.</s><s> why i don't know, it still installed.</s><s> 3. good 4. the nature of a trojan is to installed itself, but it did not, your anti-virus stopped it and isolated it.</s><s> on the update process, adobe i would think would advise of updates directly to your computer by secure servers just as microsoft does if you have automatic updates permitted.</s><s> even if you go to microsoft and install manually, same thing.</s><s> you can be sure these servers are well protected.</s><s> an imposter would have to have a lot more info than your ip address.</s><s> any website you visit gets that anytime you access it.</s><s> these bad guys automatically search for insecure computers, not a one on one basis.</s><s> just like you sometimes receive a recorded phone message, if you answer you hear it, if you don't there is no connection made.</s><s> same thing with the trojan, it rang, your anti-virus answered the call.</s><s> ha-ha 5.</s><s> i received my first prompt from adobe on 2/18/10, but was busy, so clicked on the "remind me later" option.</s><s> no, i don't know if it was signed or not and have never known in all the times fp has been updated.</s><s> i have never worried about that.</s><s> i don't think a bad guy is going to install a perfectly working flash player on my system, he wants more than that and if he got it, i'd have more problems than flash player. 
no, in my opinion you are fine, your flash player files are all correct.</s><s> as far as some things not signed, i have a couple of add ons that are not signed.</s><s> in fact i use a brothers 4 in 1 and it's not signed and dell support(which i'm sure you have also) is not signed.</s><s> but you can be sure my anti-virus and very important programs are. 
</s><s>if i were you i'd relax and if there is a problem down the road, cross that bridge when you come to it.</s><s> it all looks good as far as i can see.</s><s> the only thing is there is no need for getplus/nos/ and if you decide to remove them the gp.ocx will more than likely remove when you remove getplus/nos from add/remove.

<s>hi tomasz77, i'll try to explain a little bit.</s><s> when adobe or any other company comes out with an update, users have a choice in how they update.</s><s> with this latest fp update, it came out on 2/11/10.</s><s> i became aware of it on 2/12/10. now i could have updated on 2/12/10 by going to several of the adobe sites and updated.</s><s> i chose to wait for adobe to prompt me and update that way, because that is how my fp has always been updated.</s><s> many users receive not only the fp update automatically but adobe reader in the samer manner.</s><s> i receive a prompt for adobe reader updates also. 
</s><s>my avast anti-virus does the same thing when a new version is available.</s><s> a pop up comes up and tells me a new version is available.</s><s> at that time i can click on it and avast will update to the new version.</s><s> now, i also can go to their website and update from there.</s><s> microsoft is the same way.</s><s> many users have set their system for automatic updates, which whenever microsoft has any update for windows or ie it will be downloaded and updated automatically.</s><s> i have chosen to have microsoft advise me updates are available and choose which update i want and when.</s><s> now likewise, i can also go to the windows update and download that way. 
</s><s>when i receive a prompt from adobe for flash player or reader, i am not sent or transferred to any website.</s><s> it is all done automatically, i just watch what is being done until it is finished.</s><s> then i go to my flash folder to make sure the correct files have been installed, go to manage add ons to make sure shockwave flash object has been also and reboot.</s><s> my opinion is that the person that told you that you would be transferred to a website during the process of the install via the prompt was/is mistaken.</s><s> makes no sense, what's the point? 
</s><s>in your first post, you said you noticed that the update was not signed by adobe and you deactivated it.</s><s> the only way you could have checked during the uninstall and install was to have stopped the process and therefore the update was not finished.</s><s> then in your post#9 you said you updated ie & ff.</s><s> at that point you should have used the uninstaller first.</s><s> then in post#14, you used the uninstaller.</s><s> then you installed fp, using the "get.adobe.com" site.</s><s> that site has the dlm/getplus/nos installer. 
i hope this has answered all of your questions.</s><s> thanks, eidnolb

<s>hi verdy, well clearly this is not coming from adobe.</s><s> everyday the bad guys are at work and the anti-virus programs are constantly updating to battle this.</s><s> i don't see what adobe could do to combat spam. 
</s><s>microsoft just took a lot of heat with an update that was being blamed to cause the bsod for xp users that installed the windows update.</s><s> they investigated and the cause was a aurelon rootkit infection that was already on the computers that were having a problem.</s><s> this rootkit infection was able to change the windows kernel and the system was unstable then the update was an "effect" not the cause.</s><s> microsoft went to people's houses that reported these problems and got the hard drive info and ran multiple tests and were able to verify the exact problem. 
</s><s>as anyone knows, a rootkit infection is a very serious matter and microsoft did an excellent investigation to find the cause.</s><s> also, other xp users that did not have the rootkit infection, installed the same update and no reports of any bsod has been reported.</s><s> and microsoft verified all of this in their testings. 
</s><s>perhaps before we blame adobe we might want to wait and see if something that microsoft just experienced has not happened.

</s><s>this time, this is not necessary, the component starts running immediately and starts playing in the local zone without an explicit user action.</s><s> that's why i think that there's a new security hole exploited, or that there's an incorrect assumption in the security checks performed by flashplayer before it activates the script stored within the swf file (which is loaded from an external domain (not related to the webmail domain or to the local untrusted zone of a local mail client). 
</s><s>flash is supposed to be loaded by the <embed> element in an html mail from within an unsecure zone (notably if the email itself is not digitally signed from a secure domain): it should have the strict minimum authorizations: it should not run, it should just be able to render the first frame of static objects, but no user action should be allowed.activating "onmousehover" events immediately is a severe security hole in this case: i thought this was the case, but visibly, the malware authors of this swff have found a way to circumvent this restriction, and exploit it.

<s>well i need to be able at least to have a safe preview.</s><s> and on a webmail, there's simply no preview mode where html rendering can be disabled, in order to just show the plain-text code.</s><s> in this preview mode, all javascript in the html is disabled, lots of components become inactive, and a few <embed> elements are allowed, but loaded by disabling the auto-play parameters (notably of flash). 
</s><s>flash is then supposed to be loaded but not allowed to run, it can just attempt to render the static elements and possibly only the first frame of a video (we should need to click somewhere to play it). 
i confirm that the mere "mouseover" action is enough to play the flash object.</s><s> and it is not tolerable, because the flash object covers almost all the surface of the window: right-clik on a message to preview, it opens, but immediately, you don't have the time to place the mouse cursor out of the rendering area before the swf gets loaded.</s><s> so flash intercepts a mouseover on the new html page that appears.</s><s> this event should not trigger anything.</s><s> this is not the case here.</s><s> and one of the actions is to automatically download a supposed "flashplayer" installer (with the latest version), but i don't know where it comes from.</s><s> there's not even any confirmation that the browser can intercept, because all happens within flash that the browser annot control itself.</s><s> the flash object here is used to open a new browser window on a new (unknown) url for the download, as if the user itself had followed an active link from a local application (for example like when activating a shortcut on the desktop). 
</s><s>all happens as if flash thought that the user initiated the download, and the web browser also does not detect it (i don't see the normal browser yellow-bar alert at the top of the window that should happen before such download starts).</s><s> yes i can still block the download, only because i have set the browser to always ask for the target folder of downloads, and never proceed it immediately. but this is not ideal, and i need to cancel it : this requires centering the mouse on the screen to reach the cancel button or the close button of the "save as..." dialog.</s><s> but as soon as the "save as..." dialog closes, the mouse is now on top of the flash object, which retriggers immediately the "mouseover" event, which reopens a download. 
</s><s>this is really irritating.</s><s> and prone to errors made by users that may finally accept it by accident, or just to terminate an infinite loop of retried downloads. 
</s><s>flash should really not honor the "mouseover" event by default.</s><s> only a "mouseclick" on the flash object can be a convincing event, that can be forwarded to the swf content.</s><s> all javascript within the swf should then be completely inactive before this effective click. 
</s><s>this attack seems to work now (given the rate at which i receive this spam now), because it requires absolutely no social engineering.</s><s> it just runs without permission.

<s>note: i don't use ie, so i don't blame microsoft here. 
i use google chrome which is supposed to display an yellow bar alert before authorizing the download.</s><s> this does not occur.</s><s> (i may blame google for that). 
i also blame adobe for honoring the mouseover event immediately from a simple preview of an html page (even where all referenced scripts are disabled, a setting that adobe flash player completely ignores too...</s><s>) 
</s><s>and yes, i need to use a webmail because i read emails on multiple locations (my internet speed is fast enough that the overhead of the webmail is negligeable). 
</s><s>google also does not list the websites hosting this swf as malicious.</s><s> none of my antivirus or antispam or antirootkit or antispam softwares are helping to detect and block this swf. 
i can just conclude that flash is used as a propagation vector, helping the worm to spread (and the swf is the worm, it can come from everywhere, it has no distinctive name and no distinctive url, and apparently it is also mutating, so sha1/md5 content hashes are not helping to detect it). 
</s><s>flash needs to be secured more: if a flash object can contain javascript, this javascript has to be digitally signed and secured, or it should never honor all the interactions without an explicit user consent.</s><s> the flash object should also display somewhere the effective url from where any download is started: there's simply no indication of the domain name from where the malicious (fake?</s><s>) flashplayer installer is downloaded. 
</s><s>my system is still clean, but given that none of the security tools i have tried are deteting this swf, this suggests that this is a new form of attack.</s><s> let's fight it early before it creates too mauch damages and infects too many users on the web (that will then become new open doors for further variants and new attacks). 
</s><s>if i receive new copies of this swf, i will try to list them in the other messages thread where i first discussed it.</s><s> ihave deleted them since now, but givn that there's been no action by security tools authors since a week, we must escalate the problem and inform users about this threat.</s><s> i'll be happy when there's will be a detection mechanism in some security suites, and then when there will be new security restrictions in flash, or/and in google chrome or other browsers, that will help mitigate or block this kind of attack. 
(we will still have to live with social engineering, but this is manageable.</s><s> i cannot easily manage automated scripts that run without any explicit user action, like here).

<s>my email provider is the former wanadoo (in france), now renamed orange.</s><s> apparently it is targettting the millions of users of orange in france. 
i have this email since more than 10 years, orange is no longer my isp, but i keep the account, instead of multiplying the number of accounts (and multiplying the sources of problems (and the ways to manage them), just in order to keep my existing subscriptions in lots of contributing areas. 
i never use social networks, i never use pirate sites.</s><s> i can give piratebay, only because the fake flashplayer was detected there in 2009. however, the signature must have changed because now the fake flashplayer uses a version that was only realeased by adobe during the last month. 
</s><s>so i think that the detection (in norman, is generic, and this is a new variant). anyway, this is not the w32/delf.drly trojan that is causing me troubles (even if it is detecgted since only a few hours).</s><s> for me the major problem is the way the swf worm carries the javascript which then automatically starts the download of the trojan fake flashplayer installer. 
</s><s>so there's effectively a problem in flash player. but it is strange that norman released a detection only in the last 12 hours, when someone in piratebay could detect it in 2009 with this exact name (w32/delf.drly)...</s><s> may be this was a typo because in 2009, the related trojans were "w32.delf.drl", "w32.delf.drn", "w32.delf.dry" (with a three-letters extension, not 4-letters now). 
</s><s>note also: the md5/sha1 of this fake flashplayer is changing for each copy i receive.</s><s> this is normal because it is packed as a generic delphi executable containing a cab resource, and the executable contains calls to the win32 cabviewer.dll api from microsoft, to delete/create cab entries in a fpi resource. 
</s><s>the swf file is also mutating regularly (depending on the mirror hosting it), apparently to change the internal url from which the fake flashplayer will be downloaded. 
</s><s>md5/sha1 file signatures do not work.</s><s> we need to detect it by computing digital signatures on distinct code or data segments within the executable (but here again the exact size is changing, there is apparently some random data padded in various parts of the code and data segments).</s><s> i don't know if there is a similar system for the javascripts embedded in a swf file, or if antivirus can parse the javascript embedded in a swf, before it is rendered by the original flash player. 
i really think that flashplayer must absolutely be digitally signed by adobe using a secure certificate, including for its updates. and adobe must further restrict the authorizations in its internal javascript engine used by its flash player, and completely disable mouseover events as long as there's not been at least one click to start playing it. 
</s><s>yes this means that advertizing banners in various sites will no longer be animated automatically.</s><s> or adobe could animate them but only using the video data present within the swf object itself (it should not be allowed to perform any web request before an active click in the banner).</s><s> the adobe flash player should also display its own local icon to close a malicious swf content displayed in an embedded flash object, without passing any click to the swf'sembedded javascript.</s><s> in other word: don't instanciate the flash javascript engine before the component has been explicitely activated by the user.

<s>you did not see the issue.</s><s> the download starts on a mouseover event.</s><s> even if the video starts "playing" it just contains a single frame with a poor resolution.</s><s> the file is too large for this single frame, notable after the compression from swf to sfc (220kb is too much for just a single frame and a basic static gui interface with a few simple buttons).   the rest is certainly a complex script that will attempt to bypass the security tests (based on counting stack frames, something that could be easily exploited by an uncaught exception within the flash player renderer, but trapped at lower level by the javascript).   note that this is definitely not a simple url at end of the video. if this was the case, it would open as a normal popup and would be blocked by the browser.</s><s> note that the download starts before the browser actually sees a popup (probably a secondary method to get this same download) and displays an alert.   and anyway, flash player 10 is supposed to restrict the use of popups and file downloads in actionscripts, as long as there's not been any activation by an explicit click.</s><s> here a mere "mouseover" is enough, this should not have worked.</s><s> this is a bug in flashplayer10 which defeats one of its documented design requirements (this vulnerability existed in falsh player 9, and flash player 10 was explicitly modified to change the requirement: no internet interaction is allowed before activation, the only data usable is the one within the swf file itself, the actionscript should be completely stale, with the javascript engine blocked or possibly even not instantiated at all, before activation in flash player 10; before this activation, falsh player should only use its own rendering and should manage all user events without using any part of the script within that file; it should only render the properly encoded videos, with a strict validation, ans the static gui objects that make up the gui interface visible in the flash component, like here the "menü" button, and theother play or bolume control buttons should should just be static images).   see also these recent cve-mitre/secunia report about adobe flash player:   cve-2010-0186 cve-2010-0187   https://secunia.com/advisories/38547/ "adobe flash player domain sandbox bypass vulnerability"   i think it may be related to the same bug (and here i think this may be somewhere in the actionscript transitions/effects specified in the embedded css for displaying the static "player" interface, and that will run within the context of the wrong security zone)   i passed the swf to a swf validator (the one used by doubleclick for its advertzing banners), it is correctly encoded, but doubleclick should never tolerate such swf in its advertized banners if they can freely open popups and freely perform downloads (saving to local disk, and not just within the unsafe player cache for its sandbox)   so this swf is demonstrating that was possible in flash player 9 and supposed to be closed in flash player 10 by a new security restriction still works as before (and so it can launch the same attacks that occured in last august-september 2009).</s><s> and it's not surprizing that it is used now to try downloading new versions of a worm that has had many variants during last automn. it took many months by adobe to design a solution against this vulnerability (and this has caused the development of a flashblocker addon for firefox and ie browsers).   i think that this bug is critical for all commercial advertizing networks delivering ads in flash format in lots of websites (doubleclick being one of the most wellknown), because the lack of automatic detection of this behavior means that these ads must once again be manually tested (but the doubleclick test is still based on what happens when you make an active click, a mere "mouseover" event was not supposed to activate the link within the banner).   the current code also bypasses the popup blockers by reaching another unrelated domain immediately prior to any user activation on the same component within the same webpage and same browser frame displaying the same document. all happens as if the link hidden in the swf had been explcitly launched from a desktop shortcut or from a browser's "favorite" link these links are not supposed to display a confirmation before reaching an external site, because they are normally launched by an explicit user click or keypress).   "mouse over" events should only perform actions requiring data from the same domain (for example changing an image by another stored in the same domain, or using scripts loaded from the same domain).</s><s> they are definitely not explicit user actions.</s><s> they should not grab the mouse, they should not grab the keyboard input, they should not be able to use the clipboard, they should not be able to read or save data on disk out of the sandbox's temporary storage in the player's cache which should remain isolated in the same domain, they should not be able to open any new frame (window or tab), and they should not be able to access to the container document (to modify its dom tree and insert html elements there), they should not be able to control any other browser's frame (even if they know their name), they should not even be able to read any other file from the browser's cache (which is separated from the player's cache), except if they belong to exactly the same domain and this domain is in the whitelisted/secure zone.   there are probably several other restrictions where this swf has exploited vulnerabilities.

<s>yes i received it in a html mail just cointaining this <embed> element that will be redered by flash. 
</s><s>the problem is that flash when it is loaded in an unsafe web zone (such as an email), will automatically enable the mousehover event. 
</s><s>if you're reading your mails online on a webmail, even in the safest "preview" mode, it will still allow showing the first frame and the gui of the video component, but also it will enable the mousehover event, which will be raised almost immediately as soon as you open the preview (the flash component covers almost all the screen, there's a big chance that the mouse cursor will be within the area covered by the component when the preview gets open, so a mousehover event occurs immedaitely that activates the malicious javascript in the swf file. 
i absolutely don't know how flash can be restricted more by detecting a cross-zone or cross-domain scripting security issue here: can the locally installed embedded plugin, loaded from an unsecure zone or from a webpage served by the webmail service, detect that the referenced swf is in fact loaded from another unrelated domain, so that it should be rendered also as unsecure, with all user interactions disabled before there's an explicit click ? 
a mousehover is not enough.</s><s> in an unsafe environment, only an explicit click should be allowed (so "onmouseclick" could be enabled to activate the flash object, but "onmousehover" should not be honored.</s><s>) 
</s><s>what is worse id that the component can also immediately start an active download to local disk, which by default is the default download folder where you typically download your flash player installers (so this swf will attempt to overwrite the existing local copy of the original adobe flash player installer.</s><s> it will also attempt to download some other scripts that will force running this bad installer.</s><s> it also immedateily opens a new browser window that will attempt to download and run other files in the local zone. 
</s><s>i've never seen such use of flash within emails before, that allowed it to run this way.</s><s> i think this is a new securty hole, and a new exploit: someting is probably wrong in the flash security settings (a door supposed to be closed can be opened by the javascript within an external swf file). 
</s><s>i've reported all these spammy worms as spams to my webmail provider, but they still continue to reach my mailbox, at an increasing rate from all around the world.</s><s> this suggests that the worm is very successful in its infection, and so there's really a security issue that is not covered anywhere. 
</s><s>none of my antivirus and antispywares are detecting this worm (and none of my antispam filters are detecting it either): it is possibly using mutable code with encryption to hide the effects of its embedded malicious flash-javascript.

<s>yes, this swf is a downloader, and it can use any kind of virus (it already does in addition to downloading a "new" flashplayer from unknown source).</s><s> the bad thing is that the swf downloader can effectively bypass the flashplayer 10 security setting (no click required, a simple preview is enough, and the mouseover even is honored to launch the downloads before the antipopup (built in the browser) can even detect it.</s><s> one good antimeasure is to make sure that the browser will always ask for the storage location of the newly downloaded files, so that you can cancel it. don't allow it to proceed immediately using the default download folder of the browser (because we still have the "save as..." confirmation dialog).</s><s> but i fear that it will be possible for a swf downloader to bypass even this "save as..." dialog by providing a working location (if it can get access to the name of the user's home folder, something that will be easier than guessing the randomized folder name used by the browser's cache, or by the flashplayer cache) 
</s><s>note also that if uac is disabled, and the user is using a administrator account, the swf downloader could also try to download directly in c:\windows or in c:\, but another accessible location is c:\windows\temp; for this reason, i have not named the windows folder c:\windows, and i have created another c:\windows folder with all permisions denied to everyone, including the "system" account: i can read from it but can't even delete it myself or write anythin there, except after booting in "safe mode" and logging in with a specific account using a key stored on a separate cdrom with various administration tools : even a live boot cd will not be able to write there). 
</s><s>given that i've not allowed to download the fake plash player that the swf wants to save, i absolutely don't know if its an original, or what it contains or which effects it can do (the descriptions for both files are still incomplete in the websites of the security centers i have contacted and that have built detections or counter-measures for their security tools).

<s>yes i received it in a html mail just cointaining this <embed> element that will be redered by flash. 
</s><s>the problem is that flash when it is loaded in an unsafe web zone (such as an email), will automatically enable the mousehover event. 
</s><s>if you're reading your mails online on a webmail, even in the safest "preview" mode, it will still allow showing the first frame and the gui of the video component, but also it will enable the mousehover event, which will be raised almost immediately as soon as you open the preview (the flash component covers almost all the screen, there's a big chance that the mouse cursor will be within the area covered by the component when the preview gets open, so a mousehover event occurs immedaitely that activates the malicious javascript in the swf file. 
i absolutely don't know how flash can be restricted more by detecting a cross-zone or cross-domain scripting security issue here: can the locally installed embedded plugin, loaded from an unsecure zone or from a webpage served by the webmail service, detect that the referenced swf is in fact loaded from another unrelated domain, so that it should be rendered also as unsecure, with all user interactions disabled before there's an explicit click ? 
a mousehover is not enough.</s><s> in an unsafe environment, only an explicit click should be allowed (so "onmouseclick" could be enabled to activate the flash object, but "onmousehover" should not be honored.</s><s>) 
</s><s>what is worse id that the component can also immediately start an active download to local disk, which by default is the default download folder where you typically download your flash player installers (so this swf will attempt to overwrite the existing local copy of the original adobe flash player installer.</s><s> it will also attempt to download some other scripts that will force running this bad installer.</s><s> it also immedateily opens a new browser window that will attempt to download and run other files in the local zone.

<s>i now receive a lot of spams formated in html and referencing a malicious flash object, supposed to display a video that does not run, but still that activates an immediate download of a malicious .</s><s>exe file (a worm) downloaded from the same site as the video. 
</s><s>why does just a preview of the html message in my webmail not only shows the malicious video component to render it in the stop state (i don't click anywhere in the message), but that also immediately activates its internal javascript that immediately starts a download and opens a new browser window? 
i did not find any solution for this problem; as it now forbids me just previewing messages before deleting them, i will soon have to drop flash completely. 
</s><s>downloading a file should not be authorized by default in flash, without a user action initiating it, notably when the component comes from another domain than the zone of the displayed html message (which is anyway in the same zone for potentially dangerous sites). 
</s><s>i've setup flash to use the maximum security settings, this does not work.</s><s> those pesky spams will kill flsh compeltely for me. 
</s><s>please adobe find a solution, where i can forbid any flash component loaded from an unsecured zone to use a download to local disk, and the only interaction possible is only to load the swf and initiate it in a non active state where it will just display the first static image of the video and no script will be activated befire an explicit user action. 
</s><s>for flash, the only user action that launches the download is a simple mousehover.</s><s> this is really not enough, because the swf covers the whole surface of the webmail (whose title is for now "holaaaa!", and displays a flash video component showing a hispanic woman laughing). 
</s><s>i've not been able to record a safe copy of this spam without activating it partly.</s><s> this swf absolutely wants to force the download of "flashplayer10.0.45.2.exe" which is not the original from adobe and is infected, it also tries to download other files, but as i block the first one, the remaining files won't appear. 

i really think that this is a huge security hole in flash, which is already exploited, now massively via spams (i receive copies of these spams referencing this worm-swf about 5 or 6 times a day, and this number is growing, the content shows some text in spanish, but this does not matter). 

</s><s>the html content of the spams just contains this malicious flash: 

<embed height="360" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="634" src="http://www.users.qwest.net/~benpeg72/secure/wanadoo.swf"> 

(various urls are used for the same flash object, from all around the world on lots of domains and in lots of user web spaces or blogs allowing flash videos, this one may already be blocked, when you'll read this message).

<s>yes i received it in a html mail just cointaining this <embed> element that will be redered by flash. 
</s><s>the problem is that flash when it is loaded in an unsafe web zone (such as an email), will automatically enable the mousehover event. 
</s><s>if you're reading your mails online on a webmail, even in the safest "preview" mode, it will still allow showing the first frame and the gui of the video component, but also it will enable the mousehover event, which will be raised almost immediately as soon as you open the preview (the flash component covers almost all the screen, there's a big chance that the mouse cursor will be within the area covered by the component when the preview gets open, so a mousehover event occurs immedaitely that activates the malicious javascript in the swf file. 
i absolutely don't know how flash can be restricted more by detecting a cross-zone or cross-domain scripting security issue here: can the locally installed embedded plugin, loaded from an unsecure zone or from a webpage served by the webmail service, detect that the referenced swf is in fact loaded from another unrelated domain, so that it should be rendered also as unsecure, with all user interactions disabled before there's an explicit click ? 
a mousehover is not enough.</s><s> in an unsafe environment, only an explicit click should be allowed (so "onmouseclick" could be enabled to activate the flash object, but "onmousehover" should not be honored.</s><s>) 
</s><s>what is worse id that the component can also immediately start an active download to local disk, which by default is the default download folder where you typically download your flash player installers (so this swf will attempt to overwrite the existing local copy of the original adobe flash player installer.</s><s> it will also attempt to download some other scripts that will force running this bad installer.</s><s> it also immedateily opens a new browser window that will attempt to download and run other files in the local zone. 
</s><s>i've never seen such use of flash within emails before, that allowed it to run this way.</s><s> i think this is a new securty hole, and a new exploit: someting is probably wrong in the flash security settings (a door supposed to be closed can be opened by the javascript within an external swf file). 
</s><s>i've reported all these spammy worms as spams to my webmail provider, but they still continue to reach my mailbox, at an increasing rate from all around the world.</s><s> this suggests that the worm is very successful in its infection, and so there's really a security issue that is not covered anywhere.

<s>i now receive a lot of spams formated in html and referencing a malicious flash object, supposed to display a video that does not run, but still that activates an immediate download of a malicious .</s><s>exe file (a worm) downloaded from the same site as the video. 
</s><s>why does just a preview of the html message in my webmail not only shows the malicious video component to render it in the stop state (i don't click anywhere in the message), but that also immediately activates its internal javascript that immediately starts a download and opens a new browser window? 
i did not find any solution for this problem; as it now forbids me just previewing messages before deleting them, i will soon have to drop flash completely. 
</s><s>downloading a file should not be authorized by default in flash, without a user action initiating it, notably when the component comes from another domain than the zone of the displayed html message (which is anyway in the same zone for potentially dangerous sites). 
</s><s>i've setup flash to use the maximum security settings, this does not work.</s><s> those pesky spams will kill flsh compeltely for me. 
</s><s>please adobe find a solution, where i can forbid any flash component loaded from an unsecured zone to use a download to local disk, and the only interaction possible is only to load the swf and initiate it in a non active state where it will just display the first static image of the video and no script will be activated befire an explicit user action. 
</s><s>for flash, the only user action that launches the download is a simple mousehover.</s><s> this is really not enough, because the swf covers the whole surface of the webmail (whose title is for now "holaaaa!", and displays a flash video component showing a hispanic woman laughing). 
</s><s>i've not been able to record a safe copy of this spam without activating it partly.</s><s> this swf absolutely wants to force the download of "flashplayer10.0.45.2.exe" which is not the original from adobe and is infected, it also tries to download other files, but as i block the first one, the remaining files won't appear. 

i really think that this is a huge security hole in flash, which is already exploited, now massively via spams (i receive copies of these spams referencing this worm-swf about 5 or 6 times a day, and this number is growing, the content shows some text in spanish, but this does not matter). 

</s><s>the html content of the spams just contains this malicious flash: 

<embed height="360" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="634" src="http://www.users.qwest.net/~benpeg72/secure/wanadoo.swf"> 

(various urls are used for the same flash object, from all around the world on lots of domains and in lots of user web spaces or blogs allowing flash videos, this one may already be blocked, when you'll read this message).

</s><s>the problem is that flash when it is loaded in an unsafe web zone (such as an email), will automatically enable the mousehover event. 
</s><s>if you're reading your mails online on a webmail, even in the safest "preview" mode, it will still allow showing the first frame and the gui of the video component, but also it will enable the mousehover event, which will be raised almost immediately as soon as you open the preview (the flash component covers almost all the screen, there's a big chance that the mouse cursor will be within the area covered by the component when the preview gets open, so a mousehover event occurs immedaitely that activates the malicious javascript in the swf file. 
i absolutely don't know how flash can be restricted more by detecting a cross-zone or cross-domain scripting security issue here: can the locally installed embedded plugin, loaded from an unsecure zone or from a webpage served by the webmail service, detect that the referenced swf is in fact loaded from another unrelated domain, so that it should be rendered also as unsecure, with all user interactions disabled before there's an explicit click ? 
a mousehover is not enough.</s><s> in an unsafe environment, only an explicit click should be allowed (so "onmouseclick" could be enabled to activate the flash object, but "onmousehover" should not be honored.</s><s>) 
</s><s>what is worse id that the component can also immediately start an active download to local disk, which by default is the default download folder where you typically download your flash player installers (so this swf will attempt to overwrite the existing local copy of the original adobe flash player installer.</s><s> it will also attempt to download some other scripts that will force running this bad installer.</s><s> it also immedateily opens a new browser window that will attempt to download and run other files in the local zone.

<s>yes, this swf is a downloader, and it can use any kind of virus (it already does in addition to downloading a "new" flashplayer from unknown source).</s><s> the bad thing is that the swf downloader can effectively bypass the flashplayer 10 security setting (no click required, a simple preview is enough, and the mouseover even is honored to launch the downloads before the antipopup (built in the browser) can even detect it.</s><s> one good antimeasure is to make sure that the browser will always ask for the storage location of the newly downloaded files, so that you can cancel it. don't allow it to proceed immediately using the default download folder of the browser (because we still have the "save as..." confirmation dialog).</s><s> but i fear that it will be possible for a swf downloader to bypass even this "save as..." dialog by providing a working location (if it can get access to the name of the user's home folder, something that will be easier than guessing the randomized folder name used by the browser's cache, or by the flashplayer cache) 
</s><s>note also that if uac is disabled, and the user is using a administrator account, the swf downloader could also try to download directly in c:\windows or in c:\, but another accessible location is c:\windows\temp; for this reason, i have not named the windows folder c:\windows, and i have created another c:\windows folder with all permisions denied to everyone, including the "system" account: i can read from it but can't even delete it myself or write anythin there, except after booting in "safe mode" and logging in with a specific account using a key stored on a separate cdrom with various administration tools : even a live boot cd will not be able to write there).

<s>i now receive a lot of spams formated in html and referencing a malicious flash object, supposed to display a video that does not run, but still that activates an immediate download of a malicious .</s><s>exe file (a worm) downloaded from the same site as the video. 
</s><s>why does just a preview of the html message in my webmail not only shows the malicious video component to render it in the stop state (i don't click anywhere in the message), but that also immediately activates its internal javascript that immediately starts a download and opens a new browser window? 
i did not find any solution for this problem; as it now forbids me just previewing messages before deleting them, i will soon have to drop flash completely. 
</s><s>downloading a file should not be authorized by default in flash, without a user action initiating it, notably when the component comes from another domain than the zone of the displayed html message (which is anyway in the same zone for potentially dangerous sites). 
</s><s>i've setup flash to use the maximum security settings, this does not work.</s><s> those pesky spams will kill flsh compeltely for me. 
</s><s>please adobe find a solution, where i can forbid any flash component loaded from an unsecured zone to use a download to local disk, and the only interaction possible is only to load the swf and initiate it in a non active state where it will just display the first static image of the video and no script will be activated befire an explicit user action. 
</s><s>for flash, the only user action that launches the download is a simple mousehover.</s><s> this is really not enough, because the swf covers the whole surface of the webmail (whose title is for now "holaaaa!", and displays a flash video component showing a hispanic woman laughing). 
</s><s>i've not been able to record a safe copy of this spam without activating it partly.</s><s> this swf absolutely wants to force the download of "flashplayer10.0.45.2.exe" which is not the original from adobe and is infected, it also tries to download other files, but as i block the first one, the remaining files won't appear. 

i really think that this is a huge security hole in flash, which is already exploited, now massively via spams (i receive copies of these spams referencing this worm-swf about 5 or 6 times a day, and this number is growing, the content shows some text in spanish, but this does not matter). 

</s><s>the html content of the spams just contains this malicious flash: 

<embed height="360" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="634" src="http://www.users.qwest.net/~benpeg72/secure/wanadoo.swf"> 

(various urls are used for the same flash object, from all around the world on lots of domains and in lots of user web spaces or blogs allowing flash videos, this one may already be blocked, when you'll read this message).

<s>hello verdy, 
thanks for posting also in my thread to alert me. 
am i right to conclude you receive this spam via your mail program?</s><s> if yes, a possible security measure would be to deactivate showing the html content in the mail program (my mail program, thunderbird, does it this way as default). 
</s><s>if you want to bring this to adobe's attention, i would advise to open a support case as well as i'm not sure if this forum is browsed by adobe employees regularly.

<s>yes i received it in a html mail just cointaining this <embed> element that will be redered by flash. 
</s><s>the problem is that flash when it is loaded in an unsafe web zone (such as an email), will automatically enable the mousehover event. 
</s><s>if you're reading your mails online on a webmail, even in the safest "preview" mode, it will still allow showing the first frame and the gui of the video component, but also it will enable the mousehover event, which will be raised almost immediately as soon as you open the preview (the flash component covers almost all the screen, there's a big chance that the mouse cursor will be within the area covered by the component when the preview gets open, so a mousehover event occurs immedaitely that activates the malicious javascript in the swf file. 
i absolutely don't know how flash can be restricted more by detecting a cross-zone or cross-domain scripting security issue here: can the locally installed embedded plugin, loaded from an unsecure zone or from a webpage served by the webmail service, detect that the referenced swf is in fact loaded from another unrelated domain, so that it should be rendered also as unsecure, with all user interactions disabled before there's an explicit click ? 
a mousehover is not enough.</s><s> in an unsafe environment, only an explicit click should be allowed (so "onmouseclick" could be enabled to activate the flash object, but "onmousehover" should not be honored.</s><s>) 
</s><s>what is worse id that the component can also immediately start an active download to local disk, which by default is the default download folder where you typically download your flash player installers (so this swf will attempt to overwrite the existing local copy of the original adobe flash player installer.</s><s> it will also attempt to download some other scripts that will force running this bad installer.</s><s> it also immedateily opens a new browser window that will attempt to download and run other files in the local zone. 
</s><s>i've never seen such use of flash within emails before, that allowed it to run this way.</s><s> i think this is a new securty hole, and a new exploit: someting is probably wrong in the flash security settings (a door supposed to be closed can be opened by the javascript within an external swf file). 
</s><s>i've reported all these spammy worms as spams to my webmail provider, but they still continue to reach my mailbox, at an increasing rate from all around the world.</s><s> this suggests that the worm is very successful in its infection, and so there's really a security issue that is not covered anywhere. 
</s><s>none of my antivirus and antispywares are detecting this worm (and none of my antispam filters are detecting it either): it is possibly using mutable code with encryption to hide the effects of its embedded malicious flash-javascript.

<s>hi verdy (tomasz77 too) thanks for the explanation of what is going on.</s><s> i replied to your post to tomasz77, but your additional information here is very helpful. 
i use hotmail and can enter websites and email addresses into a "safe list" and the spam control that hotmail provides is second to none in my opinon.</s><s> i never receive spam and don't open any email that i don't know the sender, i immediately mark(check the box beside the email) as junk and this marks the sender as unsafe and then i delete the email without ever opening it.</s><s> once i do that i never receive another email from that sender.</s><s> this is how i handle emails from unknown websites or emails.

<s>yes, this swf is a downloader, and it can use any kind of virus (it already does in addition to downloading a "new" flashplayer from unknown source).</s><s> the bad thing is that the swf downloader can effectively bypass the flashplayer 10 security setting (no click required, a simple preview is enough, and the mouseover even is honored to launch the downloads before the antipopup (built in the browser) can even detect it.</s><s> one good antimeasure is to make sure that the browser will always ask for the storage location of the newly downloaded files, so that you can cancel it. don't allow it to proceed immediately using the default download folder of the browser (because we still have the "save as..." confirmation dialog).</s><s> but i fear that it will be possible for a swf downloader to bypass even this "save as..." dialog by providing a working location (if it can get access to the name of the user's home folder, something that will be easier than guessing the randomized folder name used by the browser's cache, or by the flashplayer cache) 
</s><s>note also that if uac is disabled, and the user is using a administrator account, the swf downloader could also try to download directly in c:\windows or in c:\, but another accessible location is c:\windows\temp; for this reason, i have not named the windows folder c:\windows, and i have created another c:\windows folder with all permisions denied to everyone, including the "system" account: i can read from it but can't even delete it myself or write anythin there, except after booting in "safe mode" and logging in with a specific account using a key stored on a separate cdrom with various administration tools : even a live boot cd will not be able to write there). 
</s><s>given that i've not allowed to download the fake plash player that the swf wants to save, i absolutely don't know if its an original, or what it contains or which effects it can do (the descriptions for both files are still incomplete in the websites of the security centers i have contacted and that have built detections or counter-measures for their security tools).

<subject>Basic information on Flash Killer / "kill-bit"</subject>
<post author="pwillener" timestamp="Jul 20, 2011 9:17 PM">
<s>after a pm discussion with eidnolb i realize that it was not the best recommendation to ask users to modify their windows registry.  there are indeed safer ways to update registry information.   the easiest would be if i could upload a .reg file as an attachment, but forum attachments are still disabled.  therefore the next best thing is to have users create, then execute a .reg file.  or download the zipped .</s><s>reg file at the bottom of this post from my own website.   do the following: open notepad select and copy the three (four, if counting the blank line) lines below, then paste them into the notepad window windows registry editor version 5.00

[hkey_local_machine\software\microsoft\internet explorer\activex compatibility\{d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000}]
</s><s>"compatibility flags"=dword:00000000 save the notepad data as remove_kill-bit or similar (to the desktop, or my documents), then close notepad right-click on the saved file, then rename it to remove_kill-bit.reg double-click on the renamed file to execute it when you get a pop-up "are you sure you want to add the information ... to the registry?" click [yes].   alternatively you can download a zipped version (remove_kill-bit.zip) from this attachment
