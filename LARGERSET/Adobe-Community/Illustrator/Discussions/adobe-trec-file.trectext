<s>if you use the clipping mask tool, it will "crop" your image, but if you try to export it as a raster file, your dimensions will remain the same as the original photo's dimensions, meaning you will have white space in your jpeg/png/bmp/gif/tif file where your clipping mask is...i've had this problem before, the way i deal with it is...get ready...i use ms paint to easily crop out the white space by pulling the image limiters(little blue dots)to only where my image should show, rotating the image if necessary, and repeating the process until i have my image cropped...no need to go back into photoshop, or even use photoshop.</s><s> one of the rare times when ms paint comes in handy...to be honest, i've never used it for anything else.

<s>if you want to totally eliminate content outside a mask in illustrator (giving you a true crop), you can use the following method: 
select the path that you would have used for the clipping mask and, instead of making a mask, fill it with, oh, say, white.</s><s> then, set the opacity for that masking object to 0% using the transparency palette/panel.</s><s> then, with that object and the underlying raster image selected, flatten transparency.</s><s> (use 100% vector on the quality slider and make sure the 'preserve alpha channel' option is unchecked.</s><s>) ungroup the result. 
</s><s>you should now be able to independently select the various portions (inside and outside the mask) and discard those you don't need.</s><s> the links palette/panel will show you what's going on. 
</s><s>you can use this method with multiple clipping masks in a single operation.</s><s> you don't even have to initially embed the underlying image for this to work.

<s>if you use the clipping mask tool, it will "crop" your image, but if you try to export it as a raster file, your dimensions will remain the same as the original photo's dimensions, meaning you will have white space in your jpeg/png/bmp/gif/tif file where your clipping mask is...i've had this problem before, the way i deal with it is...get ready...i use ms paint to easily crop out the white space by pulling the image limiters(little blue dots)to only where my image should show, rotating the image if necessary, and repeating the process until i have my image cropped...no need to go back into photoshop, or even use photoshop.</s><s> one of the rare times when ms paint comes in handy...to be honest, i've never used it for anything else.

<s>if you want to totally eliminate content outside a mask in illustrator (giving you a true crop), you can use the following method: 
select the path that you would have used for the clipping mask and, instead of making a mask, fill it with, oh, say, white.</s><s> then, set the opacity for that masking object to 0% using the transparency palette/panel.</s><s> then, with that object and the underlying raster image selected, flatten transparency.</s><s> (use 100% vector on the quality slider and make sure the 'preserve alpha channel' option is unchecked.</s><s>) ungroup the result. 
</s><s>you should now be able to independently select the various portions (inside and outside the mask) and discard those you don't need.</s><s> the links palette/panel will show you what's going on.

<s>i'm not sure if you can get the exact same affect that you are looking for, but when i want to do bevel/embossing/cutout text styling while maintaining text editablitility, i apply transformations to the textblock object and store those transformations as a style. 
</s><s>so, for embossing, etc, i select the textblock with the object point (black arrow) and under the appearance tab, i duplicate the main text's fill property, then change the color to white, the blend method to screen and opacity to 40%.</s><s> i apply the offsetpath transform to it and offest the path by 2px. finally i use the "tranform" transformation filter to translate the new fill -2px vertically -1px horixontally (this gives the outerbevel-highlight appearance when positioned behind the original fill in your appearance panel.</s><s> finally, i do the same thing in reverse with the initial fill: color:black,opacity:darken 40%, fx: offsetpath +2px, transform:y:2px, x:1px.</s><s> this gives the lower shadown outerbevel. 
</s><s>here is a sample of this method in illustrator in comparison to the bevel layer style in phtooshop. 
</s><s>photoshop is clearly better, but in illustrator, this method still looks pretty good.</s><s> it at least looks good enough to get your type set the way you want it before converting to parths and tweaking your final image. 
</s><s>don't forget, once you get your style setup in appearance, you need to create a new graphic style and then you can easily apply it to any text object. 
</s><s>also, play with adding svgblur transformations to the two fx layers for smoother beveling. 
</s><s>not sure if this answers your question or if this helps or not.

<post author="jaseinatl%40gmail.com" timestamp="Apr 13, 2012 7:37 PM">
<s>i'm not sure if you can get the exact same affect that you are looking for, but when i want to do bevel/embossing/cutout text styling while maintaining text editablitility, i apply transformations to the textblock object and store those transformations as a style. 
</s><s>so, for embossing, etc, i select the textblock with the object point (black arrow) and under the appearance tab, i duplicate the main text's fill property, then change the color to white, the blend method to screen and opacity to 40%.</s><s> i apply the offsetpath transform to it and offest the path by 2px. finally i use the "tranform" transformation filter to translate the new fill -2px vertically -1px horixontally (this gives the outerbevel-highlight appearance when positioned behind the original fill in your appearance panel.</s><s> finally, i do the same thing in reverse with the initial fill: color:black,opacity:darken 40%, fx: offsetpath +2px, transform:y:2px, x:1px.</s><s> this gives the lower shadown outerbevel. 
</s><s>here is a sample of this method in illustrator in comparison to the bevel layer style in phtooshop. 
</s><s>photoshop is clearly better, but in illustrator, this method still looks pretty good.</s><s> it at least looks good enough to get your type set the way you want it before converting to parths and tweaking your final image. 
</s><s>don't forget, once you get your style setup in appearance, you need to create a new graphic style and then you can easily apply it to any text object. 
</s><s>also, play with adding svgblur transformations to the two fx layers for smoother beveling. 
</s><s>not sure if this answers your question or if this helps or not. 
</s><s>best wishes, 
jase

<s>if you are working on mac you can provide any custom extension while saving the file like save it with name "file.cs4" and then you can use that custom extension to differentiate between files saved in different versions.

<s>not sure the previous post makes sense as it was already pointed out by jacob since it is already an ai file it will open in cs 4.

<s>in addition to option 8 for the bullet point, you may well wish to have the bullet point 'hanging' freely to the left of your text block - especially if your bullet points run onto muiltiple lines.</s><s> in this case, open the paragraph dialog box and enter a value in the first field, say 18pt and then the 'opposite' value (-18pt) in the field below that.</s><s> experiment with the exact value to get it to match the width of the bullet point but it will generally move all the text away from your bullet.

<s>i use the option mentioned in this article you posted as well along with another tweak... using the "leader" option of the "tabs" settings in the "paragraph style options"

</s><s>as i (mis)understand it, you may: 
1) select the whole group and copy it, then work with the copy; 2) ungroup and then with everything selected either just pathfinder>unite or object>compound path>release and pathfinder>unite to get one simple path with the outer shape; 3) give the path the desired stroke and no fill. 
</s><s>you may move the stroked path down beneath the original artwork (and use twice the desired stroke) if you want the stroke outside the original filled shape, or depending on version you may set the stroke to be outside.

<post author="hvaranese" timestamp="Mar 17, 2014 1:32 PM">
<s>hi, i've been having this problem after i trace an image in illustrator cc then try to save it as an svg.</s><s> what fixed it for me was upping the "decimal places" option.</s><s> mine had been set at 1 and bumping it up to 5 dramatically changed my svg file, to where there were no white areas visible between my vectors.</s><s> also, checking the box that says "preserve illustrator editing capablilites" also helped somewhat.
