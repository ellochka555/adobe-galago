<s>creative cloud users can access all their themes directly within illustrator cc.</s><s> to access your themes, open the kuler panel by choosing window > kuler.</s><s> you can also access your themes and create new ones in the latest version of adobe ideas. 
</s><s>for users who prefer to explore and browse themes created by members of the kuler community first, we recommend using the web site-where you will find robust search, filter, and browsing capabilities.</s><s> once you find something you like, simply mark it as favorite and then refresh your kuler panel in illustrator. 
</s><s>for photoshop¨, indesign¨, fireworks¨, and flash¨ professional: find the new kuler panel by choosing window > kuler .</s><s> this new panel displays all of your public themes. 
</s><s>for users working on older versions of adobe software (cs4, & cs5), kuler themes can also be downloaded for use in adobe software using the adobe swatch exchange (.ase) format.</s><s> to download a theme from kuler , first make sure you're signed in.</s><s> click on the theme you'd like and click download.</s><s> this downloads the theme as an .ase file to the location of your choice.

<subject>New beta features (August) - feedback please</subject>
<post author="Dave E" timestamp="Aug 8, 2013 8:49 AM">
<s>we've added a few more beta features for you to check out.Ê in this post, i'll explain what's changed and how you view/use the new features.Ê please reply to this post to share your feedback. Ê features enabled for this group: (click this link to view the features: https://kuler.adobe.com/features/enable/newfeatures) Ê we have created a special link to give you access to new features (new feature link)--without this link you won't be able to see the new features.Ê this link will allow you to use the site, same as before, but will also enable the new features that we're looking for feedback on.Ê so, here's an overview of what's new: Ê (1) re-order swatches: you can re-order the colors in your swatch simply by clicking and, while continuing to press down, drag the color to the desired location.Ê give it a try and let us know what you think.</s><s> (2)"slider" editing controls: previously we had one slider that controlled the brightness level of your color - we've added a slider control for each value in the color space you are editing.Ê for example, if you are working in the rgb color space, you will see a slider control for "r", "g", and "b".Ê for rgb, you will see a 4th control, set apart from the others, that allows you to control brightness.Ê each control provides a visual spectrum which will allow you to visually edit your colors with more precision.Ê Ê note, we are still working out a few performance issues for these features on the android default browser and windows surface.Ê ideally, you will have access to another browser to test these features on.Ê Ê in addition to the beta features mentioned above, we've also rolled out several features which were previously in beta.Ê those features include creating themes from an image, resizable color wheel, and less distracting borders.</s><s> that's it for now.Ê we look forward to reading your feedback!

<post author="Michael%20Trout" timestamp="Aug 8, 2013 8:37 AM">
<s>looking better and better! 
i am testing in google chrome in windows 
1) reorder swatches - this works as described.</s><s> click, drag and drop.</s><s> it will be good to have this feature back.</s><s> on the down side, sometimes changing the base color causes the swatches to reorder... and sometimes the button to set the base color does not respond at all while the swatches shuffle.</s><s> it hasn't been consistent enough to track down a cause. 
2) slider editing controls - good to see these back, too!</s><s> these greatly speed coarse adjustments to colors, while using the cursor keys in the number fields allows for finer deatail control of the number.</s><s> seems to work as intended with my brief testing.</s><s> a possible option would be to have a toggle to switch between the full sliders and the brightness slider for those that preferred the other way or that simply wish to simplify/minimise the appearance (i like the full slider control, but at times could see the simpler view beneficial as an option). 
</s><s>thanks for the opportunity to preview these features! 
-mt 
edit: another thing that seems to work better now is the list of color spaces.</s><s> it no longer jumps open on hovering over it.</s><s> i like that it retains the view setting (open to full list or 'minimized' to hex + 1) regardless of the pointer hovering over it. 
</s><s>feature request: on the sliders, perhaps you can add/enable a set of sliders for the hex values?</s><s>.</s><s> perhaps add an option to minimize the color space list to only hex values?</s><s>.</s><s> this could be beneficial for those that work in hex color values only.</s><s> and, since this is all hypotheical for now, perhaps a toggle to enable or disable a limit to web-safe colors when tweaking hex values via sliders?

<s>i like the website for the most part, but i would like to be able to see more swatches on a page, perhaps a selector for more or less columns.

view the public swatches and be able to sort them like the previous versions.</s><s> also be able to favorite, share, etc. from the extension.</s><s> more sorting possiblities, weekly, daily, by location, etc. sign in under another adobe id within window follow a creator create a group where you can share color schemes ( group sharing - great for team wanting to coordinate color scheme on projects ) create folders of colors to be used on a project by project basis
